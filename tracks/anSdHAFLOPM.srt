1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,410
PAUL IRISH: So thank
you for joining us.

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,590
We're going to be talking about
the Chrome Developer

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:10,290
Tools and what sort of new
features are available.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,150
Covering everything that's kind
of happened in the past

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,100
six months or anything that you
haven't known about, but

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,010
good stuff.

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,470
So the way that I want to get it
started is introducing who

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,820
we have here in this Hangout.

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm Paul Irish.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm on the Chrome Developer
relations team.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,590
And I like the Chrome Developer
tools quite a bit.

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,750
We also have joining
us Pavel Feldman.

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,080
Pavel is the tech lead of
Chrome Developer Tools.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,504

16
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:44,986
Say hello.

17
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:46,200
PAVEL FELDMAN: Hey.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,700
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,430
Also on the Chrome team,
we have Sam Dutton

20
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,525
coming in from London.

21
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:54,930
SAM DUTTON: How are
you doing, guys?

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,600
Good to see you.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,650
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

24
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,290
And also over there,
Peter Beverloo.

25
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,545
PETER BEVERLOO: Hey,
good morning.

26
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:03,990
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

27
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,490
If you haven't checked out
peter.sh, it's a great blog

28
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,590
coming with weekly updates on
what's happening inside Chrome

29
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,270
and WebKit and the Chrome
Dev tools in particular.

30
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,060
So that's a great source for
what's new and breaking in

31
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,310
Chrome Dev Tools land.

32
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,665
We also have with
us Alex Sexton.

33
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:26,382
ALEX SEXTON: Howdy.

34
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:29,140
PAUL IRISH: Alex is a JavaScript
and front-end

35
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,520
developer down in
Austin, Texas.

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,220
And we're looking to get one
more developer with us pretty

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,760
soon, Paul Lewis.

38
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,970
We hope to see him joining us.

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,340
But we'll get started now.

40
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,286
Nice.

41
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:52,178
Is that Paul?

42
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,026
PAUL LEWIS: Yo.

43
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:53,890
PAUL IRISH: Oh, great.

44
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,950
Paul, we were just finishing
up introductions.

45
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,580
So Paul Lewis, based over in &mdash;

46
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,890
you in the UK now?

47
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,260
PAUL LEWIS: I'm in
London, yeah.

48
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,990
PAUL IRISH: London, perfect.

49
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:13,400
Paul is a WebGL, CSS3, 3D
transforms, GPU, JavaScript

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,340
hacker, making cool, fun,
awesome, creative stuff.

51
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,900
So the way that we're going to
go about this, we have a

52
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,600
Google Moderator with a bunch
of questions that you could

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,720
vote up and down.

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,170
That you should see that in
the Google+ posts that we

55
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,340
have. You can click over
there and vote up

56
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,360
other people's questions.

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,800
Vote down them if you don't want
to hear us cover that.

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,010
And ask anything that you want
to get an answer to.

59
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,365
And if that sounds good,
we'll get started.

60
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:51,610

61
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,260
So in the Chrome Developer
Tools, I just

62
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,780
have them open here.

63
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,260
And we're going to walk through
some of the things

64
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,510
that are new.

65
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,470
One thing that I should point
out is we do have the ability

66
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,190
to zoom the UI, which is really
handy for this use case

67
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,330
of showing you guys.

68
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,380
So now if you hit Command Plus,
Command Minus, it zooms

69
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,130
the entire thing.

70
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,100
This works out really well for
projecting or anything else.

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,820

72
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,320
So if you haven't looked at
the Dev Tools in about six

73
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,470
months, you might not have
noticed down in the very

74
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,010
bottom right is a little
settings cog.

75
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,590
And down here, the Chrome
Developer Tools' own settings.

76
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,800

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,870
One of the nice things in here
is the ability to override the

78
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,840
user agent.

79
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,010
And so now we can set the user
agent to be one of any of

80
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,270
these predefined other browsers
or define our own

81
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,070
user agent that we want
Chrome to mask as.

82
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,600
And so [INAUDIBLE]

83
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,330
the navigator dot user agent
JavaScript property, but also

84
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,740
the user agent that goes out
in the Request tab here.

85
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,350
So it's a complete end to
end UA masking solution.

86
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,769

87
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,170
Another setting right beneath
this, and this is brand new,

88
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,560
is emulate touch events.

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,860
And so if you've done mobile
work before, you might have

90
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,740
been frustrated with the fact
that you can't do real touch

91
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,050
events on desktop, and you
always have to be using a

92
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,630
mobile device and fire
up your emulator.

93
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,750
So now we can emulate touch
events right in Chrome.

94
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,520
So to show off this, I'm going
to bring up a little demo.

95
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,810

96
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,600
So this is just a little
canvas app.

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,840
And as you touch it, it draws.

98
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,180
Inside my browser right now, I'm
clicking all over and it's

99
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,460
not doing anything.

100
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,800
But if I bring up the Chrome
Developer Tools and I have the

101
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,680
Dev Tools open with the settings
checked, all the

102
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,410
touch start, touch end, touch
move events are emulated.

103
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,630
So I get exactly the kind
of behavior that I want.

104
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,880
Pretty nice.

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,370

106
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,620
Good.

107
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,160

108
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,220
Pavel, did you want to talk a
little bit about the color

109
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,470
picker that's now available?

110
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,442

111
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:44,040
PAVEL FELDMAN: Yeah, that's
something new that we have. It

112
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,785
is interesting, because it's
a third party contribution.

113
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:49,990
And we are happy about third
parties contributing code into

114
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,560
the Web Inspector in
Chrome Dev Tools.

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,165
So if you try to click the
little color swatch, the color

116
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:58,820
picker will show up.

117
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,940
It shows you the gradient and
you can adjust transparency

118
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,400
through these [INAUDIBLE]

119
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,730
channel.

120
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,170
And as you are adjusting the
transparency, you'll see how

121
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,740
the background is visible
through the

122
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,100
color that you've chosen.

123
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,400
So it's pretty essential.

124
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:28,140

125
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,400
SAM DUTTON: Pavel, can you still
get at the selected for

126
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,610
changing the representation
of the color?

127
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:33,925
PAVEL FELDMAN: Right, right.

128
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,770
The Control click will be
[INAUDIBLE] different formats.

129
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,080
PAUL IRISH: Control click.

130
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,216

131
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:42,518
I was wondering about that.

132
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:58,640

133
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,550
Control click.

134
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,180
PAVEL FELDMAN: Now Control click
on the swatch in the

135
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,000
list down here.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,950
And the [INAUDIBLE] can adjust
this alpha slider, and you

137
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,450
will see the background.

138
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,370
Try adjusting this alpha
slider, and look

139
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,720
at the color preview.

140
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,570
You don't actually need to have
any [? background ?] yet.

141
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,490
Just move this thing.

142
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,390
Yeah, you will see a little
chessboard thingy.

143
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,650
I don't need the color
in the preview.

144
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,510
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

145
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,860
So the Color Picker's been a big
request for a long time.

146
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,450
So we're very happy to
have that available.

147
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,190
So one of the things you might
have also noticed in this view

148
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:44,100
is that the check boxes
are now on the left.

149
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,020
So this has been a big request
for a long time, of these

150
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,460
check boxes to disable these
styles have been on the right

151
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,680
for the longest time.

152
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,130
And a lot of people have
felt it makes more

153
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,080
sense on the left.

154
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,040
So now if you open a Chrome
Canary, they're on the left.

155
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,260
So Pavel put this in
about last week.

156
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,720
And we hope you'll like that.

157
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,360
PAVEL FELDMAN: And it
was [INAUDIBLE]

158
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,230
over a two-year struggle.

159
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,420
This and the single
click, right.

160
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,785
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, it's
a single click.

161
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:20,740

162
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,200
For the longest time in the
Chrome Developer Tools if you

163
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,570
want to change, for instance,
any of these properties, like

164
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,680
I want to change font size from
small to large, I had to

165
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,550
double click.

166
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,520
And it would go into this
edit mode, and then I

167
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,490
could change that.

168
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,539
Now it's only a single click
to make that change.

169
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,420
So it's a lot more malleable.

170
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,710
It's very nice.

171
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,810

172
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,060
Cool.

173
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,690

174
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,440
Any newcomers?

175
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,690
So we're just walking through
some of the features with

176
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,300
Chrome Developer Tools
and the new stuff.

177
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,700
We have a Google Moderator.

178
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,090
And if you want to ask any
questions, please just load up

179
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,650
questions or ask any new
ones over there.

180
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,990
Sam, is there anything in the
Moderator that you think we

181
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,220
should talk about right now?

182
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,370
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
there sure is.

183
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,660
We've got a stack of stuff
coming in on Moderator.

184
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,640
PAUL IRISH: Great.

185
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,990
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, blimey.

186
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,750
Where to start?

187
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,050
OK, well I'll start
at the top.

188
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,600
The most popular question
we've had so

189
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,460
far, I think, is &mdash;

190
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,480
well it's a big one, asking if
we could walk through tracking

191
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,570
down a memory leak in a
page or an extension

192
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,660
using the Heap Profiler.

193
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,310
PAUL IRISH: Sure, good one.

194
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,560
SAM DUTTON: Go for it.

195
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,800

196
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,710
PAUL IRISH: So I'm going
to bring up this.

197
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,070
Pavel, feel free to interrupt
me as I go along with this.

198
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,910
We have a little
test page here.

199
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,150
And if we look at the source of
the test page, we've got a

200
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,120
few things going on.

201
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,780
We have an array.

202
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,080
And we have a button.

203
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,080
And when it's clicked, we're
going to do this.

204
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,070
We're going to create a new P.
And we're going to add that

205
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,880
into the page.

206
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,210
And add that into our
holding array.

207
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,970
And after a little bit,
we're going clear

208
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,240
out the page's content.

209
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,790
So what this looks
like is that.

210
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,100
Just adding it.

211
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,880
The page is being cleared.

212
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:45,290
But what you'll notice in
something like Timeline is

213
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,700
that the memory usage just
continues to go up.

214
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,800
And the garbage collection
never cuts that

215
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,570
memory usage back down.

216
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,840
And this right here is an
indication that you might be

217
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,980
encountering a memory leak.

218
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,310
So I'll try and go through
how we can identify

219
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,560
where this leak is.

220
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,460

221
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,750
So we go over to Profiles,
and we're going

222
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,370
to take a Heap Snapshot.

223
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:30,995

224
00:11:30,995 --> 00:11:32,990
PAVEL FELDMAN: Didn't notice
it if you start the

225
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,545
Timeline, did you?

226
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,640
PAUL IRISH: Timeline
is still recording.

227
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,920

228
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,590
OK, Snapshot done.

229
00:11:43,590 --> 00:12:06,793

230
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,690
ALEX SEXTON: Perhaps there's
a memory leak in

231
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,680
the Snapshot tool.

232
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,930
PAUL IRISH: Oh.

233
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,890

234
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,580
I'm going to try and go
ahead with the action.

235
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,600
So if we've identified in the
Timeline tool that there is

236
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,625
increasing memory usage,
I'm now going to- oh,

237
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,710
we have zero bytes.

238
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,020

239
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,926
I might have to try this over in
Chrome Stable in a moment.

240
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:38,750
PAVEL FELDMAN: No, no.

241
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,670
Go back to the Canary.

242
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,720
PAUL IRISH: You like it?

243
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,480
PAVEL FELDMAN: Yeah.

244
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,870
Just try clearing it up and
collecting another one.

245
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,470
Don't do anything.

246
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,720
Just collect [INAUDIBLE]

247
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,420

248
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,030
PAUL IRISH: Ooh, that's
much better.

249
00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:01,886

250
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:04,259
PAVEL FELDMAN: I wonder how
much you have used.

251
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,696

252
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:11,420
PAUL IRISH: How much what?

253
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,940
PAVEL FELDMAN: How
much Heap site?

254
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,720
How big Heap is?

255
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,000
Because it takes too long.

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,950
It should take this much time
for the Gmail, not for the say

257
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,610
hello thingy.

258
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,326
PAUL IRISH: Ouch.

259
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:23,576
Yeah.

260
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:30,320

261
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,300
Let's try one more.

262
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:41,620

263
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,770
So I'm going to give
this a shot.

264
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,975
I'm going to hit the
button five times.

265
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:48,390

266
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,285
And we're going to record
another Heap Snapshot.

267
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:56,420

268
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,800
And then we're going to go
over to comparison mode.

269
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:09,560

270
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,780
Pavel, are we seeing
what we want?

271
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,740
PAVEL FELDMAN: No.

272
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,730
And this doesn't look
like Stable to me.

273
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,030
Is it?

274
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,500
PAUL IRISH: No, it's
not Stable.

275
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:27,249

276
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:28,570
PAVEL FELDMAN: Now that's
a [INAUDIBLE]

277
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:36,094

278
00:14:36,094 --> 00:14:39,070
PAUL IRISH: All right,
over in Stable.

279
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,210
One two, three, four, five.

280
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,460
Another Snapshot.

281
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,380

282
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,400
Clicking over to the second
Snapshot and changing our mode

283
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,650
to comparison.

284
00:14:53,650 --> 00:15:10,820

285
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,070
ALEX SEXTON: Yay.

286
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,368

287
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:15,618
PAUL IRISH: It's good.

288
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:27,810

289
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,060
Pavel.

290
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,399

291
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,420
PAVEL FELDMAN: Don't
look at me.

292
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,412
You have all of these chaps
doing something to the left.

293
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,662
PAUL IRISH: Something.

294
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:40,060

295
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,640
Something going on.

296
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:54,570
So what I'm used to seeing is
capturing a delta of five.

297
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,660
Associating my five clicks with
five new items and being

298
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,445
able to track &mdash;

299
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:05,420

300
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,910
it's actually a paragraph
element &mdash;

301
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,840

302
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,070
paragraph element back to
that holding array.

303
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,170

304
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,270
Ah, here we go.

305
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,520
Yep.

306
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,820

307
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,660
So here we are basically seeing
the paragraph elements

308
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,350
that were created and their
retaining path back to

309
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,800
holding down here.

310
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,460

311
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:39,500
So essentially tracking through
the Timeline tool.

312
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,750
[INAUDIBLE]

313
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:53,770

314
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,415
PAUL IRISH: We good?

315
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:57,912
Nice.

316
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,240
SAM DUTTON: You're
back on air.

317
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,390

318
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,640
PAUL IRISH: Good.

319
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,710

320
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:11,880
All right, so I'm going to move
on from memory as it gets

321
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,130
pretty fun.

322
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:19,150

323
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,305
PAVEL FELDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

324
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,140
or not?

325
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,140
Did he close it?

326
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,651
PAUL IRISH: I think I have it.

327
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:29,370
PAVEL FELDMAN: So I
can go real quick

328
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,550
through the actual scenario.

329
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,970
So what you do is you
take a Snapshot.

330
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,955
And then you do a set of
sections that should result in

331
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,000
a zero sum, so that you create

332
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,300
something and discard something.

333
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,846
And you expect no objects to
be retained in the memory.

334
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:48,030
And then you compare those
Snapshots and see the deltas.

335
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,130
And if the delta is positive,
it means that objects with

336
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,280
corresponding classes are
still in the memory.

337
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,310
And expanding these classes and
clicking on the instances

338
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,810
will show retaining trees,
the retaining paths, the

339
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,470
JavaScript path that is
retaining this very object.

340
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,010
And depending on the version of
Chrome that you're running,

341
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,450
if you look at this list and
find detached DOM nodes row in

342
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,605
this very table &mdash;

343
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:20,270
do you have it there?

344
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,030
Try sorting by alphabetically
and going to the

345
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,800
detached DOM something.

346
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,260
It's a top-level entry.

347
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:35,110

348
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,360
No, you don't have it?

349
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,520

350
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,100
Try going from conversion to the
summary just for a second.

351
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,890
I'm bringing it up because
you can start with the &mdash;

352
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,140
do you have detached
DOM nodes?

353
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,930

354
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,420
PAUL IRISH: Yep.

355
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,550
PAVEL FELDMAN: So there's
a special row for

356
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,150
detached DOM trees.

357
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,750
And If you expect no DOM nodes
to be detached from your tree,

358
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,280
you start looking in here.

359
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,500
And if you see some, it means
that these are the DOM

360
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,220
fragments that are retained
by the JavaScript.

361
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,730
And that's pretty much the first
thing you do when you

362
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,710
find the memory.

363
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,305
Because all your DOM nodes are
either on the screen or in the

364
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,550
caches that you are aware of.

365
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,760
And Paul has shown the generic
Profiler capabilities.

366
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,040
But Browser is not
only JavaScript.

367
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,140
It is also DOM.

368
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,900
And those two are bound in
a sophisticated manner.

369
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,080
So to assess this binding and
see if there memory leaks on

370
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,470
the boundary between
the DOM and

371
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,130
JavaScript, you look in here.

372
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:53,230

373
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,290
SAM DUTTON: So just to get
that straight, a really

374
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,580
standard process for checking
for DOM leaks is, take a

375
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,520
Snapshot, do something, take a
Snapshot again, do comparison,

376
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,500
and then look for, what
is it, detached DOM

377
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,550
tree at that point?

378
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,849
PAVEL FELDMAN: Well, in the
generic case, you just look

379
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,130
for the class names
for [INAUDIBLE]

380
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,030
object in your model.

381
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,542
So if you are writing
a Gmail [INAUDIBLE]

382
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:20,260
conversation [INAUDIBLE], and if
you see an increase in the

383
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,680
number of threads or
conversations where you don't

384
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,360
expect it to, you start with
these large objects.

385
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,860
If you don't have any clue on
the large object of your

386
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,890
model, you start with the DOM
binding, because that's where

387
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,980
the probability of the leak
is extremely high.

388
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,752

389
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:40,002
SAM DUTTON: Thanks.

390
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:42,952

391
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:46,560
PAUL IRISH: So while we're
looking at JavaScript, I want

392
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,750
to show some of the new stuff
that we have for kind of

393
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,425
navigating around the JavaScript
that you have. I'm

394
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:56,200
going to bring up this page.

395
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,530
So over in the Scripts panel, if
you open it, you might see

396
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,870
something like this.

397
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,210
And in the left-hand side is
the Scripts Navigator.

398
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,025
And by default, it's in
a temporal state.

399
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:13,300
But you can click this to make
sure that it's always there

400
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,620
and permanent.

401
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,840
But below, you're going to see
all your active scripts on the

402
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,100
page sorted by origin
and folder.

403
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,930
And anything coming in from
your Chrome extensions is

404
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,570
going to be separated out now.

405
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,875
So it's a lot easier and cleaner
to see what's active.

406
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,270
ALEX SEXTON: Yay!

407
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,821
PAUL IRISH: It's great, yeah.

408
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:35,650

409
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,190
Another nice way to look through
any active scripts

410
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,280
that you have is hitting Command
O. So Command O will

411
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,540
bring up the Go To Resource
little navigator.

412
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,450
And I can type out any portion
of the file name and navigate

413
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,700
directly into that.

414
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,320

415
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,254
PAVEL FELDMAN: I think in
[INAUDIBLE] routines I think

416
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:04,877
you can do these [INAUDIBLE]

417
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:07,580

418
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,670
type first two letters,
[INAUDIBLE]

419
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,430
case large name, and
it will match it.

420
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,482
You don't have those because
[INAUDIBLE].

421
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:17,732
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, that's true.

422
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:24,910

423
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,160
Must have been a scripts
[INAUDIBLE].

424
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,730

425
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:38,322
And so within a script, so I
could beautify it down here.

426
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:41,810
And I get some sense, and
I can scroll around.

427
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,500
I can hit Command L and
go to a specific line.

428
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,070
But now I can also hit Command
Shift O and navigate by

429
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,510
function name.

430
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:58,710
So I can jump directly to my
siblings method of jQuery or

431
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,520
anything else.

432
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:07,700
So having this really easy way
to jump between my function

433
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,620
definitions saves quite a bit
of time in navigating your

434
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,740
scripts and then placing
[INAUDIBLE] points or doing

435
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,990
your debugging.

436
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,550

437
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,940
One of the things that I think
is also really nice when it

438
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,350
comes to JavaScript debugging is
being able to walk through

439
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,970
your code in a very large view
and seeing your page.

440
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,700
And so one of the new things
that you have in the Chrome

441
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,100
Dev Tools is the ability to
dock all the tools to the

442
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,650
right-hand side.

443
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,390
So now I can check that.

444
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:45,055

445
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:49,010
I'll even bring that back.

446
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,414
So now I have my page, my
code over on this side.

447
00:23:54,414 --> 00:24:00,460
And I can work out exactly
what's going on, what the

448
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,710
behavior is.

449
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,800

450
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,970
Right beneath that
is Disable Cache.

451
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,440
And Disable Cache will disable
the disk cache.

452
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,350
So Chrome is actually very
aggressive when it comes to

453
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,710
caching, because it likes
things to be fast. But

454
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,970
sometimes as a developer, that
caching works against you.

455
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,486
So Disable Cache will just
bypass the disk cache.

456
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:30,605
So you're always getting
the freshest resources.

457
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:33,870

458
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:40,960
Pavel, so correct me if I'm
wrong, this cache affects only

459
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,550
this current page, because it's
only enabled when I have

460
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,240
the Dev Tools open, right?

461
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,552
PAVEL FELDMAN: Right.

462
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:51,760
PAUL IRISH: So if you have that
checked, you close off

463
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,170
Dev Tools, your cache
is now functioning

464
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,320
as it normally should.

465
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,810
So you have to have the Chrome
Dev Tools open for this to

466
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,060
take place.

467
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,672

468
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,110
ALEX SEXTON: I wanted to
interject a little bit.

469
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,830
One thing I do a lot in my
development is actually

470
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,600
override hosts and host files
and try to do local

471
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,120
development against
servers that way.

472
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,460
So I also have to clear often
my DNS cache and sometimes

473
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,900
even my socket cache.

474
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,040
And you can get to that through
the Chrome protocol

475
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,460
net dash internals and clear
it in the DNS there.

476
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,950
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, that's
a good one.

477
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:42,140
Go into About About, you can
see all the Chrome internal

478
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,920
diagnostics pages.

479
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,570
[? AV ?] cache internals is a
really good one where you can

480
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,670
remove any existing application
caches that you

481
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,580
have. Good if you're
doing offline work.

482
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,070
Net internals is a pretty
significant internal

483
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,430
diagnostic page where you can
see a lot of things going on

484
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,940
with sockets and DNS.

485
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,065
So it's a good call, Alex.

486
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:13,220

487
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,730
Should we take another question
from the Moderator?

488
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,800
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
let's do that.

489
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,280
Let's have a look and see.

490
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,624
I'll tell you, today
was talking about &mdash;

491
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:28,780
let me just find the
questions here.

492
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,770
Let me just find the right
question from Pat in Auckland.

493
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,930
This question actually we were
asked today at a Dev Tools

494
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,425
presentation was, is there a
plan, something on the Dev

495
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:44,040
Tools roadmap to either directly
support or some other

496
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,890
way facilitate extensions,
which

497
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,670
allow less SASS debugging?

498
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,960
So Pat's thinking of something
like FireSass for FireFox.

499
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,090
Says I've heard about
source mapping.

500
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,680
But from what I understand,
that only applies to JS.

501
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,756

502
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,925
PAVEL FELDMAN: Yeah,
that is correct.

503
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:11,570
And we are currently not working
on last SASS support.

504
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,250
It's a bit more than source
maps for CSS.

505
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,180
Because what we would like to
see is actually your variables

506
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,400
here make sense on the
right-hand side So that you

507
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,350
can edit them as
in the source.

508
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,330
And they would take immediate
action in the browser, which

509
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,220
enables the transformation from
the source to the browser

510
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,340
terms and mapping things back.

511
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,800
So it's a bit more complex than
basically mapping the

512
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,195
locations in the minified
and non-minified script.

513
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,810
More work.

514
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:50,510
But as you probably know, WebKit
is moving forward with

515
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,821
supporting many of these
features natively.

516
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:57,900
And we will have no
option other than

517
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,230
supporting them in the UI.

518
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,500
And once they are in the UI, we
can think about supporting

519
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,600
the mapping.

520
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,408
But [INAUDIBLE].

521
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:09,040
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

522
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,230
So there's been a spec published
on CSS hierarchies,

523
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,390
which is like your selector
hierarchy if you're

524
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,490
using SASS or LESS.

525
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,720
Also CSS Mixins, there's
a spec published.

526
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,420
And so WebKit is very interested
in baking that

527
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,780
right into the platform
as well.

528
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,240
But since we brought up
source maps, I was

529
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,490
going to show that.

530
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:41,030

531
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,820
This is source maps.

532
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,900
And the best way to demonstrate
what they do is

533
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,050
with this little demo.

534
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,230
So I have the small little
app with colors.

535
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,480
And as I click the colors,
we're just changing the

536
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,690
background.

537
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,275
This is easy enough.

538
00:28:56,275 --> 00:29:01,810
If I view source of this app,
looks down at the bottom like

539
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,370
I commented out my original
source files, and I'm just

540
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,510
including my compiled JS, which
is a bunch of minified

541
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,670
JavaScripts.

542
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:16,040
So this happens a lot when
you're in a situation where

543
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,550
you are looking in scripts and
you open up compile.js, and

544
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,250
it's minified.

545
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,690
And you want to debug
what's going on.

546
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,000
Now I can beautify it.

547
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,190
But I still have short
variable names.

548
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,600
So that's not working
out to well.

549
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600

550
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,880
But source maps give us
a lot of power here.

551
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,790
So if you notice down at the
bottom of this file is a

552
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,510
reference to source
map dot JSON.

553
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,760
Now if I bring that up.

554
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,210

555
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:04,435
So I think it's in
that JS folder.

556
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:08,500

557
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,210
So this is just a JSON file
which maps the identifiers of

558
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,570
the minified script back
to the original script.

559
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,720
And it's also referencing the
original source files.

560
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,330
So what this allows me to do
is instead of seeing this

561
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,220
compiled JavaScript here in the
Dev Tools, if I open up my

562
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,070
settings and enable
source maps &mdash;

563
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,320
I'm going to refresh the page.

564
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,490

565
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:41,600
And now, instead of seeing
compile dot JS, I see script

566
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,370
and set up and to my original
jQuery unminified.

567
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:52,220
So here I'm mapping my minified
JavaScript directly

568
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,450
back to my original files.

569
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:03,830
And I can set break points in
this and have it work exactly

570
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,420
like you want.

571
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,620
So this is the kind of base way
of looking at the future

572
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,970
of, I can take compiled
JavaScript and map that back

573
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:20,420
to my original source files,
however many there may be.

574
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,470
But source maps empower
a lot more than that.

575
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,740
For instance, CoffeeScripts &mdash;

576
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,390
being able to map your compiled
JavaScript back to

577
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,710
your Coffescript so that
you can actually debug

578
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,320
CoffeeScript right here
in Chrome Dev Tools.

579
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,920
Source maps enables this.

580
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,840
And there's a few patches
waiting on the CoffeeScript

581
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,890
project to accept.

582
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,980
And so hopefully we'll be able
to see real debugging instead

583
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,990
the Dev Tools of CoffeeScript
coming soon.

584
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,700

585
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,180
ALEX SEXTON: Does Google closure
advanced compilation

586
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,900
support source maps yet?

587
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,240
I know it's intending to.

588
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,545

589
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,795
PAUL IRISH: As far
as I know, yes.

590
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:08,214

591
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:13,080
I don't think I have this
available too much.

592
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,330
PAVEL FELDMAN: So we've been
working together with them on

593
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:15,910
the format.

594
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,650
And they are supposed
to [INAUDIBLE]

595
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,010
this format.

596
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:24,040
It's V3, so that's the one
we support in Dev Tools.

597
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,970

598
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,750
PAUL IRISH: And if you can read
this, this is kind of how

599
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,000
it works with the compiler.

600
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,460

601
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,390
So using closure compiler,
we run it.

602
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,720
We specify our original
source files.

603
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,250
We say that we want to
create a source map.

604
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,450
And we're going to use V3.

605
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,060
And then we're going
to output it.

606
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:50,760
And so this will generate the
source maps and get you off

607
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,010
looking in a good path.

608
00:32:52,010 --> 00:33:00,490

609
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,120
DOM undo and redo.

610
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,900
Pavel, you added
this recently.

611
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,770
Do you want to walk us through
how this works?

612
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,870
PAVEL FELDMAN: Yeah, we should
all give it a try, do some

613
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,550
stress in it to see if it
is crashing or not.

614
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,930
Because it is a fairly
complex thing.

615
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:20,050
So the way it works is DOM
actions, editing attributes,

616
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,520
[? remaining ?] nodes, editing
as HTML Oracle undoable as

617
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,110
well as editing CSS properties
for adding new rules and

618
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,840
modifying selectors.

619
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,150
Pretty much everything you can
see in the elements panel

620
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,770
should be undoable
and redoable.

621
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,216
And when it does so,
it preserves

622
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,480
the DOM nodes instances.

623
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,660
So it's not simply installing an
old markup or a new markup

624
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,630
and loses all the [? page's ?]
state.

625
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,550
But it is doing it in a
[INAUDIBLE] manner so that all

626
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,760
the references to your nodes
from JavaScript will still

627
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,960
basically be valid.

628
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,600
And the other addition to that
is that edit as HTML is now

629
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,320
super smart.

630
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,610
When you're editing, you
can edit the entire

631
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,760
body of your page.

632
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,230
And it will only patch the
nodes that have changed,

633
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,639
preserving identities
of the other ones.

634
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:18,010
So we can open Gmail and edit
something in the body and

635
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,280
commit the edit and all
the threads are

636
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,349
still going to be alive.

637
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:25,250
And it's all undoable
and redoable.

638
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:25,989
PAUL IRISH: Right.

639
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:32,120
So if you have event handlers
bound to part of your nodes,

640
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,120
you can still come up and edit
this entire body as HTML.

641
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,400
Make your changes.

642
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,250
And your DOM nodes are
all still fine.

643
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:47,909
So pretty sophisticated stuff
going under the hood there.

644
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,159
A very powerful feature.

645
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,480

646
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,510
But what this manifest
says in an easy way.

647
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,100
So let's say I just want to
test some things out.

648
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,250
And I want to see what this
looks like without the H1.

649
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,230
I'm going to delete.

650
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,760
And that works fine, but maybe
I want to bring it back.

651
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,410
Just hit undo, like Command
Z, and bring it back.

652
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,420
Or Command Shift Z to re that.

653
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,660
So any changes that you make
here, Command Z to bring back

654
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,625
the original state.

655
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,640
PAVEL FELDMAN: And you
can also hit F2 to

656
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,040
start editing as HTML.

657
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,790
Because we know feel that it is
safer because it preserves

658
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,060
the states of the elements.

659
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,070
And we expect users to be using
it more often, because

660
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,320
it's super flexible.

661
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,050

662
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,325
PAUL IRISH: OK, one request.
Anyone watching, if you could

663
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:52,070
just hit a Plus One on the post
so we get an idea of how

664
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,370
many people are out there,
we'd love that.

665
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,880
And Sam, could you
introduce another

666
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,410
question from the moderator?

667
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,620
SAM DUTTON: Yes, indeed.

668
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,740
We've got one from Tony.

669
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,830
Says he's from cactus land.

670
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,130
Also known as Arizona,
I think.

671
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,400
He's asking if there are any
plans for the console to sport

672
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,120
auto-complete of elements
in the current page.

673
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,860
So he's thinking of things like
an element that has an ID

674
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,420
of, oh my God I don't
want to type this.

675
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,550
And he wants to attach say
a method by jQuery.

676
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,290
He's wondering if he could do
something like [? dial a ?]

677
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:31,800
parenthesis, quote, hash, ONG
and then it auto-completes.

678
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,612
So, sounds good?

679
00:36:33,612 --> 00:36:35,596
PAUL IRISH: It sounded good.

680
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:43,412

681
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:49,180
Ah, so he basically wants
autocomplete based on the IDs

682
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,450
and classes that are already
active in the DOM and have

683
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,315
that available in the console?

684
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,270
SAM DUTTON: That's right.

685
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,410
Yep, I think that's
what he's after.

686
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,430
So whatever I guess is within
scope, so to speak, in terms

687
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,110
of ID or class.

688
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,360
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

689
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,520

690
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:18,470
So right now we do have the
ability to autocomplete

691
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,960
anything in the console when
it's already available in the

692
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,640
DOM, so any of the functions
that you happen

693
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,890
to find in the page.

694
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,570

695
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:34,360
I love this a lot just to get a
reminder of what's available

696
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,650
on Window dot location.

697
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:40,320
And I forget the names of these
properties all the time.

698
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,470
One trick that you could do.

699
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:49,450
So let's say that document
dot body had an ID

700
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,430
of my awesome body.

701
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:57,690

702
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,238
Or it's a Window dot
document all.

703
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:03,520

704
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,060
This is a terrible idea.

705
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,470
I'm not suggesting
this at all.

706
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,690

707
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,140
It looks like we won't
get completion there.

708
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,880

709
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,247
SAM DUTTON: Nice try.

710
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:22,780
PAUL IRISH: I think that's
a good idea.

711
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,910
But right now we don't have any
capabilities of bringing

712
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:31,145
in new elements and
autocompleting your selectors.

713
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:33,040
PAVEL FELDMAN: But we
totally should.

714
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,520
So by [INAUDIBLE]

715
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,770
it should happen.

716
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:44,115

717
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:46,690
PETER BEVERLOO: The IDs are not
being autocompleted for

718
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,940
performance reasons right now.

719
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,587
Basically, trying to find an
element by its ID name instead

720
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:56,995
of an actual variable is quite
slow for the rendering engine,

721
00:38:56,995 --> 00:38:58,245
for WebKit.

722
00:38:58,245 --> 00:39:03,580

723
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,080
PAUL IRISH: Actually, I'm going
to go grab my USB cable,

724
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,960
because I have something
to show.

725
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,590
Pavel, do you want to run
through just the right way to

726
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:15,490
file a bug or feature request?

727
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,570
PAVEL FELDMAN: Can I steal
control over your machine or

728
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,310
how do you do that?

729
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,730
PAUL IRISH: You can screen
share on your side.

730
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:49,355

731
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:52,033
PAVEL FELDMAN: Can you
guys see this?

732
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:54,926
PAUL IRISH: Yep.

733
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:58,080
PAVEL FELDMAN: So we're running
a magic link that is

734
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,624
called
webkit.org/new-inspector-bug.

735
00:40:04,624 --> 00:40:06,440
I'll need another browser.

736
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,260
Wait a moment.

737
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,563
So you need to be logged in.

738
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:14,341
So you need to register
at WebKit's Bugzilla.

739
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:19,995
And let me do it again
with another browser.

740
00:40:19,995 --> 00:40:21,245
A moment.

741
00:40:21,245 --> 00:40:27,910

742
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,450
SAM DUTTON: Just a quick
reminder for anyone who's

743
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,470
hanging out watching this.

744
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:38,540
You can view the different
screens by clicking on them.

745
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,390
So if you want to see Pavel's
screen or someone else's, you

746
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:46,122
can click on that individual
Hangout window down at the

747
00:40:46,122 --> 00:40:47,372
bottom there.

748
00:40:47,372 --> 00:40:50,580

749
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,870
PAUL IRISH: So is that better?

750
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,480
Can you see it now?

751
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,180
So that's the page the new
inspector bug brought me to.

752
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,650
So hold on.

753
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,680
I'm typing these web inspector
autocomplete &mdash;

754
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,630
[INAUDIBLE]

755
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,120
autocomplete something &mdash;

756
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,280
autocomplete DOM node
IDs and classes.

757
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,875

758
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,630
Name the console.

759
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:23,950
Then you describe what you want,
like you have document

760
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,020
body ID is [INAUDIBLE]

761
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:34,740
and you press FO and tab in your
console and [INAUDIBLE]

762
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,140
to expand to [INAUDIBLE].

763
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:42,940

764
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,800
And then you just
submit this bug.

765
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,000
And it goes straight
into my inbox.

766
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,780
And the reason I'm suggesting
to submit it into WebKit,

767
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,710
because whenever something is
happening within the Dev Tools

768
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,350
window, 95% of what is there
is being developed in the

769
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,100
WebKit repository
by our own team.

770
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,920
So what you do is you can either
file a bug against

771
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,210
Chromium, which will
totally work.

772
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,240
Or if you're confident it's part
of the Chrome Dev Tools

773
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,520
window, you just go ahead and
submit it into the WebKit.

774
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,820
So that's pretty much it.

775
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,070
PAUL IRISH: Thank you.

776
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,660

777
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,790
I did want to show some of a
new future that a lot of

778
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,100
people haven't seen.

779
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,270
And we're going bring up
some help for this.

780
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:43,590

781
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,480
SAM DUTTON: Just while you're
doing that, could I take

782
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,790
another question
from Moderator?

783
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:47,940
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, please do.

784
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,670
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, it's one
that people have asked.

785
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,740
Another question from
Pat in New Zealand.

786
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,460
He's asking if there's a way
to assist the break on

787
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,180
sub-tree attributes modification
breakpoint

788
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,500
functionality through multiple
page refreshes.

789
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,210
So trying to debug some
code at page load.

790
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,760
But currently, if you refresh
the page, it resets them.

791
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,160
So, yeah.

792
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,850
PAVEL FELDMAN: So it
is totally a bug.

793
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,310
It should preserve those.

794
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,000
There's a little hint, though.

795
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,270
What the tool is doing upon
page load, upon the unload

796
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:27,490
event, it will try to restore
all the breakpoints based on

797
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,010
the node IDs.

798
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:38,970
And if your DOM is dynamic or
if something has not yet

799
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,730
happened and the DOM is not
there and the node is not in

800
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,580
the DOM, the tool will
fail to do that.

801
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:50,360
But it will pick it up once
the node is there.

802
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,300
If this scenario does not work
for you, file a bug.

803
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,970
Otherwise it should
be just fine.

804
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,162

805
00:43:58,162 --> 00:43:59,120
SAM DUTTON: Thanks, Pavel.

806
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,476
That's great.

807
00:44:01,476 --> 00:44:05,850
PAUL IRISH: So I wanted to show
a really nice feature

808
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,460
that we just enabled.

809
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,930
And that is remote debugging.

810
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,220
If you haven't known, we shipped
Chrome for Android a

811
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,130
little bit ago.

812
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,560
And one of the great things that
we have available is that

813
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,880
you can actually have the full
power of the Chrome Developer

814
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,780
Tools, the sorts of things that
you've been seeing today,

815
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,920
available for your
mobile device.

816
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,800
So I'm just going to show
how this works.

817
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,840
I have my phone plugged in.

818
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,985
I also enabled USB debugging
inside the OS.

819
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:41,710

820
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,840
And I'm going just set up
an ADB port forward.

821
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,570

822
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,820
Great.

823
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,850

824
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:58,590
And now we're going to bring
up local host port 9222.

825
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,480
Cool.

826
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,870
So just to capture this.

827
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,440

828
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:13,010
So the six items up there refer
to my six open tabs

829
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,580
right here.

830
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,250
So I'm going to just go
back to Google News

831
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,600
and click it up here.

832
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:26,330

833
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,280
And so if you didn't know,
the Chrome Developer

834
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,750
Tools is a web app.

835
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,810
So I'm just running the Chrome
Developer Tools as a web app

836
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,980
inside Chrome.

837
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,780
But this is the actual inspector
of the page.

838
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,670
To show that, I'm just going to
hover over these sections.

839
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,230

840
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:52,600
And you should be seeing the
nice hover happen inside the

841
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,850
phone's UI.

842
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,720

843
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,800
So this is pretty powerful.

844
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,022
I'm going to go over to Console
just to prove that

845
00:46:05,022 --> 00:46:06,272
we've got this going on.

846
00:46:06,272 --> 00:46:13,600

847
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,190
Yeah, nice.

848
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,525
So full remote debugging
capability.

849
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,090

850
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:27,380
Things like your network timing,
the ability to run

851
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,190
Heap Profiles and get memory
debugging info on a phone is

852
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,540
something that we haven't
had available before.

853
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:40,170
And so now with Chrome on
Android, we have that full

854
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:40,475
capability.

855
00:46:40,475 --> 00:46:44,770
And we're really excited about
what that offers to mobile

856
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,020
development.

857
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,462

858
00:46:48,462 --> 00:46:50,540
ALEX SEXTON: You need a Ice
Cream Sandwich phone.

859
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,810
But you should all
get one anyways.

860
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:52,060
They're awesome.

861
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:52,320
PAUL IRISH: Peter, is
there anything you

862
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,410
want to add on that?

863
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,340
True, yeah, Ice Cream
Sandwich required.

864
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,365
Delicious too.

865
00:47:00,365 --> 00:47:02,320
PETER BEVERLOO: Yeah, Ice Cream
Sandwich is required.

866
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,950
At lunch the other day
we had [INAUDIBLE]

867
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,510
of Chrome on Androids.

868
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:11,915
And of course, there's much
more [INAUDIBLE] coming.

869
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:13,030
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

870
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,905
So get excited.

871
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:15,155
Good stuff coming.

872
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:20,570

873
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:24,520
I think we could talk about
extensions, select a

874
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,220
profiling, show paint recs.

875
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:33,256
Anything, Pavel, that you think
we should point out?

876
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:36,400
PAVEL FELDMAN: So I could say
a few words on what we're

877
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,230
currently doing.

878
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,540
So Paul has mentioned
the [INAUDIBLE]

879
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:48,360
And let me list what we are
currently committed to doing

880
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,400
and are in progress of.

881
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,122
So we are paying a lot of
attention to mobile.

882
00:47:53,122 --> 00:47:55,250
We are happy to see a remote
debugging story.

883
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:00,900
But you often want to be able
to have your mobile web page

884
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,290
from a desktop browser.

885
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,310
So what we're currently
working on is a more

886
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,570
sophisticated user agent
emulation that would allow

887
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,750
integrating screen resolution.

888
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,080
More native events that
would make sense

889
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,440
for the mobile device.

890
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,710
So that you could basically
conveniently [INAUDIBLE]

891
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,580
development for mobile.

892
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,790
We are currently working
on memory [? lot. ?]

893
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:30,620
So the Heap Profiler that is not
working on a Canary is not

894
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,890
working because we are redoing
the entire thing.

895
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,520
We want it to be simpler.

896
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,780
We want it to support
scenarios for memory

897
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,580
[? content ?] or generic
Heap information

898
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,760
capabilities and such.

899
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,440
So going full speed there.

900
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,750
We are also working on the
HTML5 features such as

901
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,920
IndexDB, which has been
recently landed.

902
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,990
It's still within the
experimental, but has good

903
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:03,470
chances of going public
in Chrome 19.

904
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:08,590
We are also focusing on the
game development stories.

905
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:13,910
And we are reworking our
timeline for better capturing

906
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:19,340
what frame is, what 16
milliseconds for frame mean

907
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,290
and what actually takes time so
that our clients would have

908
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:27,650
a way better clue on what needs
to be optimized, whether

909
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,440
it's pane layout or JavaScript
or garbage

910
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,140
collection or something.

911
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:37,230
And what else?

912
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:41,580
That's pretty much it And yes,
we are exploring different

913
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,850
persistence stories.

914
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,650
Paul, do you want to mention
a couple of extensions for

915
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,000
persistence?

916
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,250
PAUL IRISH: Yeah,
I would love to.

917
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,470

918
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:55,580
So if you've been editing your
styles, as you might have

919
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:06,590
seen, there is an ability to
get a [? dif ?] of your

920
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:12,770
changes and save the new
file back to disk.

921
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:17,530
But a lot of people have been
curious as if that little

922
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,470
path, that workflow could
be made automatic.

923
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,950
So there's been a little
bit of work in

924
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,940
that direction recently.

925
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:34,360
There's two extensions that I
would ask you to check out.

926
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,020
One of them, you can get a brief
view if you just Google

927
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:42,420
for Addy Osmani auto-save
dev tools.

928
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,310
And Addy's put out a nice little
screencast about how

929
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,370
this works.

930
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,020
But essentially, it's an
extra Chrome extension.

931
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,750
You make your changes.

932
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,010
You run a node server.

933
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,575
And it just saves the changes
that you're making into the

934
00:50:54,575 --> 00:50:58,000
Dev Tools back to your
disk as you go.

935
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,910
There's another extension made
by a member of the Dev Tools

936
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:07,950
engineering team that has
similar functionality.

937
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,760
Just a different UI.

938
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,060
And right now, they're
talking about how to

939
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,100
merge these two efforts.

940
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,600
But if you want that kind of
functionality, definitely

941
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,917
check out one of those
two projects.

942
00:51:18,917 --> 00:51:20,760
SAM DUTTON: That's great
to see, actually.

943
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,320
That covers questions we get
regularly at events and one

944
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,470
that's high up the list
on Moderator.

945
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,640
Just a reminder to people who
are watching this, if they

946
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,900
could Plus One the
page for this.

947
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,980
Because it really helps us
work out what kinds of

948
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,230
Hangouts people want.

949
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,460
So Plus One it if you could.

950
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,570
That would be great.

951
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:47,190
PAUL IRISH: There is a lot
happening in Dev Tools.

952
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:50,930
I just loaded up Canary using
a command line flag, Enable

953
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,790
Dev Tools Experiments, inside
settings that enables some

954
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:59,500
extra stuff going on as an
IndexDB, which Pavel was just

955
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,480
talking about.

956
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,800
Being able to see shadow DOM
inside elements panel, some

957
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,560
extra stuff.

958
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,950
So if you want to ride
the bleeding edge,

959
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:09,870
that's where it's at.

960
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:15,340
You can check out peter.sh for
the news on a week by week

961
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,810
basis of the entire Chrome
and WebKit projects.

962
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:22,190
But you'll get a lot of detail
on what's happening inside the

963
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,810
Dev Tools as well.

964
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:28,550
And I would also recommend
Canary

965
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:31,340
updates once a day, about.

966
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,710
And you can run it
side by side with

967
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:33,500
another Chrome instance.

968
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,280
So I really recommend running
Canary and Chrome

969
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,420
Stable side by side.

970
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,570
In Canary, you get the freshest
Dev Tools features.

971
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,160
But you get to hold on to Stable
to see what all your

972
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,100
users are seeing your
site and app as.

973
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,230
So I think that's it.

974
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,026
Anyone else have anything
they want to add.

975
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:59,686

976
00:52:59,686 --> 00:53:00,630
No?

977
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,990
Cool.

978
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:05,890
I thank my guests
for joining me.

979
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:09,270
And we appreciate you
guys coming and

980
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,280
hanging out with us.

981
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,530
So thanks.

982
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:12,130
