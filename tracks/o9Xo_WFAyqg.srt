00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,149
>> Dan Heberden: Hello. As you have been looking
it at for 15 minutes, I'm Dan Heberden. So

2
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:11,840
enough about that. I will get my slides up
here.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,840
So this is bower, at least the very basic
beginnings of what you would start to use

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,240
where you just run bower install jQuery and
you see that it went and got jQuery, installed

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,320
it for us in the current folder. What we didn't
have to do is specify a version. We didn't

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,800
have to find out what the latest version is
or whatever one we wanted.

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,600
And what does getting jQuery look like for
you? Or I mean really any library, but jQuery

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,600
is a good example.
Oops, sorry about that.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Does that mean going to jquery.com and downloading
that? Does that mean going to the github repo

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,070
and looking for maybe a built copy? Do you
have to clone the repo and then build it with

11
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:13,070
their build tools? Do you memorize URL and
use wget or curl and pull it down?

12
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,250
Bower helps because it makes installing tools
much easier. And it uses a manifest file to

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,600
declare what it is that you actually want
to download or to use in your project. And

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,170
those downloads are centralized into a commonplace,
which are very helpful, and it by itself resolves

15
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:43,170
dependencies.
So before I get into all the pieces of what

16
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,840
bower is, I would like to show you what it
looks like with a canon of other tools, a

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,399
full suite. And so Yeoman and Grunt are required,
yes, are great tools. If you haven't gotten

18
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,049
a chance to look at them or learn about them,
I really recommend diving into them.

19
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,740
But we are just going to run a quick example
to just show off some stuff that bower can

20
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,859
do.
So first we would do is get Yeoman. Yeoman

21
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:18,069
is just a scaffolding tool that lets you define
&mdash; there's a couple generators out there.

22
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,709
There are, like, 16 that it comes with and
then a bunch more that help you scaffold typical

23
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,590
applications.
And the typical application we want to scaffold

24
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,529
is a requirejs app. So we can just get generator-requirejs.
You can do this yourself but it is kind of

25
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:38,809
nice to get everything already to go without
having to do a lot of work.

26
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:45,809
I will show you what that looks like. Just
make a quick &mdash;
so assuming I have gotten those two things,

27
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:56,889
I can just run Yeoman with required requirejs
and it will do a couple of things. It will

28
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:59,669
ask me some questions, what I want the app
to be called.

29
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:05,040
We are just going to make a quick weather
app. So we will say my-weather-app and a default

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,989
description. Now, I'm not going to hit enter
now just because that's going to go through

31
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,739
and download everything from NPM and everything
from bower and everything that we need. And

32
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:19,739
I don't really trust the WiFi.
So I'm going to just change to the baked cake

33
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:27,629
in the oven. And we can see actually &mdash; I
will just do this &mdash; that it already gave

34
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:32,510
us a lot of stuff just out the gate. It gave
us an app directory with requirejs config

35
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:39,510
file that calls the main file here. And we
can &mdash; it just says jQuery in there, but we

36
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:44,819
can put anything in there.
But it also did some other stuff. It set us

37
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:51,239
up with Grunt. So we have concatenation and
minification, js hinting and that kind stuff

38
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,529
already set up.
It made a packaged JSON; and it did put our

39
00:03:55,529 --> 00:04:00,519
name in there for us, which is really convenient.
So some nice convenience measures.

40
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,519
So let's go ahead and actually write some
stuff. Now, for making a weather app, probably

41
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,229
someone has done the work of getting weather.
I'm sure actually thousands of people have

42
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,229
probably done that all by theirselves without
even looking to see if anyone has done that.

43
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:21,370
So let's just use bower, and we'll search
for weather.

44
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:28,139
I will make that a little bit bigger.
So it looks like Dan Heberden, I don't know

45
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:35,139
who that guy is, but he made a weather thing.
And I'm going to trust it for the sake of

46
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:44,270
this presentation.
So, I can just install bower &mdash; or use bower

47
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,550
to install weather. And I will save that to
my configuration file. If you have used NPM,

48
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,300
that's the same kind of thing. We will talk
more about what these pieces mean.

49
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:00,300
You can see here it went in and got the weather
component. It also got the stuff that the

50
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,270
component needs, which is jQuery.
And so now if I go back to my application

51
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,990
here, I not only have the things that were
part of the original application, requirejs

52
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:20,560
and jQuery and Qnit, but I also have my weather
module. So let's go ahead and use that. Since

53
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,560
this is an AMD module, I will just jump over
into my main file here; and I can just reference

54
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,120
it directly.
Hop back to my slides. That is not the right

55
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,080
slide.
There we go. Okay.

56
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:09,659
So in our app, we would put in some HTML for
our actual weather information, just temperature

57
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:17,099
and status, that kind of stuff. And then inside
of that, we can use that weather component

58
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:23,330
that we installed. So we'll just use require
to get that and typical AMD stuff here, so

59
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:29,969
nothing too crazy, and make a function that
actually uses the position object that the

60
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:36,969
weather API returns with temperature and condition
and that kind of stuff.

61
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,240
And then actually get our current position.
So we'll use geolocation, get our current

62
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,240
position, and pump that latitude and longitude
into our weather module.

63
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,280
I have the finished product here. Hopefully,
this will work with the connection. So I have

64
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,669
a connect server actually part of this whole
suite here, which is nice via Grunt, so I

65
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:13,669
can start a Web server on local host.
You see here that that worked pretty well

66
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:30,550
out of the box and was able to make a server
connection, do all that stuff, but we didn't

67
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,029
have to worry about finding this module and
putting it in. We were just able to take advantage

68
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:42,360
of it.
Let's look at what happened here, and this

69
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,809
is the bower.json that was generated from
what we did. And we have a requirejs and JS

70
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:52,889
dependencies that came out of the box. But
when we installed weather, it also added that

71
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:58,699
version here. The tilde means it is going
to keep the minor version. So if that goes

72
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:05,309
to 0.2.4, it will go ahead and install that.
So we looked at kind of a quick demo of what

73
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:08,529
that would look like using that with other
tools.

74
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:15,529
I do want to show you one really neat thing
since I have this up. And that is using all

75
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,870
of these tools together. And this is mostly
just a plug for Grunt and how well it does

76
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,680
all of this stuff.
I just ran every task that is set up with

77
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,629
this, so I'm hinting. I'm running my test
suite. I'm getting all of the dependencies

78
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:36,130
via requirejs and putting them all together.
And now I'm concatenating and minifying all

79
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:43,130
of that together. So my original uncompressed
file of 326K is now 23K. That's pretty cool.

80
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,120
So if you aren't doing this or haven't looked
in these kind of tools, I highly suggest doing

81
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,120
that. One HTTP request to get all of the site
running. That's pretty neat.

82
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:06,050
So why a clientside package manager? When
using clientside tools should be easy. I mean,

83
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,980
sure going to hotscripts.com and finding some
script was really fun ten years ago.

84
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,350
There's a problem with open and public code
being committed into repositories. And I don't

85
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,610
know about you, but I don't really like waiting
for github to download gargantuan repositories

86
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,510
all the time. What happens is older and buggy
versions of libraries or frameworks or plug-ins

87
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,440
get stuck in projects, and it is harder to
work around getting a new one in there. And

88
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,300
then there is a hesitancy to use an existing
solution because it is kind of a pain to go

89
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,510
out and find what's available.
When you do find out there is a great plug-in

90
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,440
or piece, you have to go find out what it
needs to run and that can be a hassle.

91
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,670
Bower, of course, makes it awesome, hence
this talk. Let's look into bower. Let's look

92
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:06,089
into what pieces it has that will help you.
We saw installation before. We can just install

93
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,769
a component and it will go and grab all of
that stuff. It will grab all the pieces, put

94
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:18,769
that into our folder. We can also do that
via manifest files. So we can declare what

95
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,860
we want, run bower install, and it will just
go through that manifest file just like NPM

96
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,670
and get the pieces that are required along
with anything that those pieces require and

97
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,740
anything those pieces require until it has
everything that you need.

98
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,220
And, of course, if you edit the manifest file,
we want to change this &mdash; say, there was a

99
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:45,220
bug and we want to force version 0.2.0, we
can do that and run bower install and it will

100
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,779
go get the right files and make sure everything
is okay as far as dependencies go.

101
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:55,029
Now, if you want to do this from the command
line, you can do that pretty easily just by

102
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:00,089
putting in the module name that you want and
then a hash mark and then a version. And that

103
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,750
will do the same thing if you need to do that
from the command line. In this case, we want

104
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,750
jQuery 1.8.0. And so we can force that.
And you can manually edit it, that's fine.

105
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:21,170
But we have this same as NPM--save and --savedev
and those let you just express what you want

106
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:28,920
to install but also put that into your manifest
file because chances are you will want that

107
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,920
any time you recreate this project or someone
else clones this project and gets it.

108
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,110
But at this point, bower is mostly just a
glorified URL shortener. Like, this is nice

109
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,759
but this isn't really what's really going
to help you.

110
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,850
So upgrading is where bower also shines in
making your life a lot easier in dealing with

111
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:57,850
clientside libraries and frameworks and plug-ins.
Since required packages don't have to be committed

112
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:06,009
into your repository, it makes discoverability
and it makes working with these libraries

113
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:10,740
much easier.
Check out bower ls. It gives you a quick look

114
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,170
at what your current project looks like. And
so in this case, we just installed jQuery

115
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:22,540
1.8.0, it is going to let us know that 2.0.0
is out and that we can look into upgrading

116
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,970
to that. We didn't have to go to the jQuery
site or make sure we follow the blog. And

117
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,509
this is for any particular plug-in or piece
that you follow. But it also hunts down the

118
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:37,180
dependencies just to make sure that everything
is fine as far as what it requires as well.

119
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,660
So we have a nice map of what our project
looks like.

120
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,149
Bower update will take the current version
and install it to the highest minor version

121
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:53,269
possible. So in this case, it will go to 1.8.3.
And that's nice if you want to just make sure

122
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:58,440
that while there shouldn't be any problems,
run the test suite, give it a run-through,

123
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,810
and then make sure you can deploy your site
using these latest versions.

124
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,829
Let's talk about the power of bower.json,
having something that expresses your clientside

125
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:16,829
needs in your application. And the easiest
way to do that is this: Just obliterate the

126
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:20,769
components directory.
And, of course, this would cripple your app

127
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:27,769
all together. And it is just as easy as running
bower install to get all of that stuff back.

128
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:35,810
Now, bower is just a package manager. Bower
doesn't give you minified code. Bower doesn't

129
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:44,930
concatenate things. It doesn't load modules
for you and it won't. You say what you want,

130
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,940
and bower gets it. Because there is plenty
of great tools out there. There is tons of

131
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,370
build tools. There's tons of things to help
you do certain tasks. Bower doesn't need to

132
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,279
do that for you. But what it does need to
do is play well with others.

133
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,129
And so since it is written in JavaScript and
since it is a node library, you can just require

134
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:08,300
it and do the same things that you can do
from the command line, search, install, look

135
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,629
at what packages are available, and control
it from maybe a custom build tool that you

136
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:20,629
have, or Grunt.
Another thing that is really nice and available

137
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,759
for you is the plug-in that Ben Schwarz made
for Sublime Text. I am not a Sublime Text

138
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:38,100
user so I might bumble around this a little
bit. But I wanted to show you what this could

139
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:45,100
look like.
Actually, let me do this from here.

140
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:54,110
All right. So here's a typical Sublime project.
And the typical way that you run the built-in

141
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:16,089
tools, command-shift-P. When you install this
tool, it adds a bower &mdash; can't really change

142
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,810
the font, unfortunately, of that particular
part of Sublime. I don't think so. Nope.

143
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,709
But what it lists there, if you can't see
it, is bower: Install, bower: Configure project

144
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:34,709
and bower: Discover packages.
And so from here, I can run bower install

145
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,500
and that gives me kind of an interactive search
so I can look for Angular and find that package

146
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:46,420
and install it right from Sublime. So I don't
even have to hop into the command line, if

147
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,410
I don't want to. Of course, if you have Little
Snitch running, it will ask you every time

148
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:56,800
but that's okay.
Just from Sublime, I was able to add something

149
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,800
into my bower.json file and it downloaded
it into my components directory where I have

150
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,829
Angular now.
So that's pretty nice. But there is another

151
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:15,829
tool that this exposes, or links to, rather,
which is Discover Packages. So sindre made

152
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:24,569
this, sindresorhus on github and Twitter.
This is a search Web site for bower where

153
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,389
you can take a look. And you can do the same
thing, Angular, and get some available metrics

154
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:37,879
about what matched that search, when it was
last updated, how many forks and stars, a

155
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,779
little bit more information to help you make
a good decision about what piece you want

156
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:49,779
to add in and discover things.
Currently there is 2,048, so exactly 2K components,

157
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:55,730
which is fantastic.
Let's look at the Angular stuff just really

158
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,500
quickly. I have a quick demo about what that
could look like, if you aren't a requirejs

159
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:07,500
fan or if you just like Angular.
So we're making a typical Angular app. Have

160
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:24,150
our namespace in the HTML, my app. And show
you the basic template of HTML. And we will

161
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:31,590
go ahead and install that Angular component
that's available.

162
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:40,540
So add our Angular script into our project.
And then add some basic module codes, so we'll

163
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,040
depend on my app and create a controller.
And this is going to make an itemized list.

164
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,780
So we see the UL up at the top. It is going
to make just a repeatable list element &mdash; or

165
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:58,780
list item based off of this item list.
But let's say that we want to make this actually

166
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:05,890
work with markdown instead. And I'm sure that
there's some kind of markdown Angular thing

167
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,470
that's existing out there. So we can search
for Angular and just parse out anything that

168
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,470
mentioned markdown. And we can also use this
Web site here or use Sublime text.

169
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,010
Angular markdown brings up the same thing.
Whatever way you choose to get there, you

170
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,210
can. And so at the end of the day, we install
that Angular markdown directive. And we see

171
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,140
that it installed Showdown. That's what it
requires for the markdown parsing. And then

172
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,570
we have Angular, of course, which is the directive
piece &mdash; or what it depends on to actually

173
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,900
run. We already installed that, so it doesn't
matter.

174
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,290
So now we have our three components that we
need to add which is Angular itself, the markdown

175
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:03,290
parser, and then the Angular markdown directive.
So we can add that module now as a dependency.

176
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,470
It has already been included as a script tag,
so it is now available. So we can include

177
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,790
it just like we would in a regular app.
Make sure that we specify that this item will

178
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:25,790
be parsed using that with the btf markdown
down here, the latter part of that li.

179
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,070
And then just add some markdown. So in this
case, on the last item we're just making that

180
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:39,070
some pretty basic markdown. And what that
looks like &mdash;

181
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,340
this is the full HTML. That got really big.
This was the full HTML that we have now that

182
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,030
was generated. These are our components all
installed. Angular, angular markdown, directive

183
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:08,030
and showdown. Bower is updated with the two
pieces that we need. And there's it running

184
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,780
those three items through the generator and
it is parsing markdown. So that didn't take

185
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,930
a lot of work to go hunt down these pieces.
Imagine that part where you find out, yes,

186
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,430
there is an Angular director for parsing markdown
and now I need to get showdown. Now we need

187
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:40,960
to look where they put their built file. You
are well aware that could be on their web

188
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,640
site. That could be in some DIS file in their
GitHub repo or in their source file but you

189
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,170
are not quite sure which one it is. And that
gets complicated and that takes time and that

190
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:57,140
is a particular barrier of entry to use that
particular plug-in. But that is also time

191
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:04,140
you don't need to spend. There's also a really
nice component or ability of being able to

192
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:12,290
work with a directory that's managed by a
tool and that is, if we go back to our step

193
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,500
three here, so I have my Bower.json file.
If I want to see what my app looks like with

194
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:34,580
a particular piece, I can just install any
version I want. If I want to test, say requirejs3

195
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,760
comes out and I want to test that with my
application, I can just install that using

196
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,300
Bower. And if my whole app just completely
explodes or I find a bug and report it to

197
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:52,300
requirejs on I install JQuery 2.0.1 and I
find a bug, I can report that bug. I can help

198
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,400
the community. I can help those projects that
I depend on. But then I can just switch back

199
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,400
to the version that I need and it wasn't a
big deal. I didn't have to, like, rename jquery.old.js

200
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:12,740
and put in the new one. If you have ever done
that &mdash; I know you have &mdash; you don't have

201
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:19,740
to anymore. So we never had to hunt down Angular.
We were able is to find everything really

202
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:30,390
easy and most of all the scripts are in a
consistent place. Now, we looked at the JS

203
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:36,660
demo earlier. I was using components as the
full path. Components weather then weather.js.

204
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:43,620
You can use &mdash; there's a Grunt contribution
plug-in for that that actually adds those

205
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,850
to your path automatically. So I could have
just had JQuery and weather and it would have

206
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:54,110
just worked. There's tools out there. Bower
has a lot of pieces to integrate with Rails,

207
00:22:54,110 --> 00:23:00,040
with different node build tools. There's a
lot of community around making it integrate

208
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:07,040
with whatever word process that you have.
So what's coming up? There's a lot of great

209
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,290
stuff that we looked at but obviously there's
room for improvement. We're not perfect. This

210
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:20,930
is still a new project. And so some of the
things that we want to do are hosted packages.

211
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,350
We want you to be able to authenticate with
the registration server. We have started working

212
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:31,180
on this. You could rename a package if you
added one or delete it. You would be able

213
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:37,460
to push a copy of a built file if you don't
want that maybe in your repository. You can

214
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,550
push that up to us directly. And, of course,
we can give a cached copy. If you don't have

215
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:48,860
git or you want that even faster, we can just
push the file that you want down, which is

216
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:55,860
really helpful. Andre, who is the lead developer
for Bower, Marco and him have been working

217
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:04,210
on a rewrite of Bower to make it faster, to
make it easier for us to work on and add better

218
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:11,210
features. So this is the quick video he made.
Let's go full screen here. I'll probably pause

219
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:20,350
it. It's a really short video. So this is
his dependencies list. These are pretty big

220
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,540
pieces. These are a lot of pieces. This is
pretty indicative of a typical real-world

221
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:34,540
app as far as how many components are there.
So what he has here is on the left is going

222
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:43,450
to be with the rewrite and then on the right
is the current version. And so those run.

223
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:52,490
Bower just goes to town getting everything.
So you see on the left it is already much

224
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:02,330
faster. He was able to get all of that content
in just 8.8 seconds, whereas the current one

225
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:09,330
is 13. And then if you have cache, which Bower
has, once you've actually done this once and

226
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,410
you've gotten &mdash; most of these repos are using
across different projects, it's now down to

227
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:24,410
2.3 seconds versus 5.7 on the current version.
And then, you know, that time you are on a

228
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,640
plane and you need to recreate the project
and you know you have all that cached, one

229
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:36,640
second. So this isn't a big commitment as
far as having a process around getting these

230
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:43,380
packages. Running, even on the current version,
it's still pretty fast and it's only going

231
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,670
to get faster and it's only going to get better.
And so working this tool into your work flow

232
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,600
not only should make your life easier but
it should do a faster job of hunting down

233
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,650
all these things for you than you possibly
could. As developers, that's the whole point.

234
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:04,650
Of course, working on the regular stuff, more
docs, less bugs. Unless you want more bugs.

235
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:13,340
I guess we could put them in. And more packages
and more integration. That's really the biggest

236
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:19,590
piece of this, is we want to make Bower something
that works with &mdash; that is extendible to work

237
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,700
with any tools and we can just write whatever
middleware, whatever plug-ins to make it work

238
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,880
so you can take advantage of it in the way
that you see fit. We can focus on just getting

239
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,880
packages, getting stuff for you in a sane
way. But we need help with that. We need help

240
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:44,760
on Bower. We need help with these pieces and
so github.com/bower, all the pieces that we're

241
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:51,300
working on are there. Bower IRC channel and
freenode, definitely come in. Chat with us

242
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,340
and let us know if you are running into any
problems. We have a Bower Google group and,

243
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,510
that's it. So I think we have &mdash; the timer
was going pretty crazy, so I'm not sure exactly

244
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:09,510
what it all means for time. But I think I
have time for questions. Anyway.

245
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:17,539
[ Applause ]
I should note, too, that if you want to, we

246
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:24,820
have a bunch of Bower stickers and if you
liked the logo, which is pretty new by Dave

247
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:33,780
Dessandro, a pretty neat logo. If you want
to support that on your laptop or child's

248
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:40,780
forehead, definitely come up and get a Bower
sticker.

249
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,410
>>> So this is awesome, really awesome. I
haven't used it yet but I definitely would

250
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:53,100
love to start using this on my projects. So
this kind of is all the client side components

251
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,660
and so on and usually all our projects are
&mdash; have, you know, server side and client

252
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:05,660
side together. Is there &mdash; I don't know how
to &mdash; is there any sort of integration between

253
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:10,230
different kinds of service side packaging
systems as well or packages?

254
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,450
>>Dan Heberden: The integration, that's where
we want to make sure that as a developer you

255
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:22,450
are the one calling the shots. And so a good
demo of this is actually my &mdash; this presentation.

256
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,570
So I hooked up &mdash; which ended up not working
that great because there's a lot of network

257
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:34,380
connections in here. But I wanted to hook
up my phone so that I could have the next

258
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:40,590
slide show up on my phone. So I wanted to
use socket.io, and so looking at that, I was,

259
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:47,590
like, I better use Bower because I'm writing
a talk about Bower. And so if I have my node

260
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:56,210
modules, I have socket.io, so in this case
I know I need socket.io on the server, so

261
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:03,210
I just add that to my package.json. And then
Bower search socket, give you a few different

262
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,740
ones available. You can see there's a client
available to get. So it's still going to be

263
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:15,390
two separate pieces because they will be two
separate libs, but having the ability to hop

264
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,730
between the two really ease easily and have
NPM installed and Bower installed as part

265
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:25,520
of your process. When you showed Yeoman earlier,
that actually runs both for you as well. Even

266
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,270
if you are building something that scaffolds
an app that you maybe build in often, you

267
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,900
can have that as part of your work flow of
just, okay, here's my server side components,

268
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,260
here's all my client side components. Go.
>>> I guess we can always script if you want

269
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:44,960
just a single install, get everything from
scratch, whatever script these components

270
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,400
as well.
>>Dan Heberden: Yes, that's why I look at

271
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,520
Yeoman generators or something similar to
do that.

272
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,660
>>> Thanks.
>>> Hi, I had a question. We use Bower at

273
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:02,830
our company and one thing I noticed is that
when you Bower install something like Bootstrap,

274
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:09,830
you get, like, 15 LS files and 15 JS files
and it's not built. Is there any way to integrate

275
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,360
with Bower to have it, you know, automatically
build that as soon as I download it? Some

276
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,030
packages actually do have the build files,
you know, in the source. But just looking

277
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:29,140
for a way to kind of improve that work flow,
I guess.

278
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:35,560
>>Dan Heberden: Yeah. There's a &mdash; so Bower
won't be the tool that builds that because

279
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,780
you can imagine that might be a make file.
In the case of Bootstrap, it is a make file.

280
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:46,120
That can be node, whatever. So there needs
to be a way to make that built version available.

281
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,490
Now, the way that Bootstrap does it, they
actually hide it in the docs folder. So, like,

282
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:56,000
you go into docs, that's where the built JS
and CSS files are. What we have been working

283
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,320
on is, there's a main property inside of Bowers,
a manifest file. So we are working on the

284
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,120
spec to bring that to more light so that the
actual file that you want is not only highlighted

285
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,200
to you, here it is, but even, like, possibly
moved to root or something that makes that

286
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,130
easier. Also, the hosted part will mean, if
you have a complicated build process, you

287
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:22,030
can publish your built copy if you don't want
in your repo. Like, I like it in the repo,

288
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,060
I think that's a cool thing. Obviously, not
everyone agrees with me. We are working on

289
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,200
that for sure.
>>> Great, thanks.

290
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,590
>>> Can I use my own modules that are not
in the directory, for example, in the Bower

291
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,630
file?
>>Dan Heberden: Yeah, if you want to &mdash; so

292
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,770
if it's something in the corporate environment
you don't have. You don't want to publish

293
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:47,330
certain things or you have private code, you
can reference any git repository and just

294
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:54,330
specify the git URL and a tag. So actually
when I was working on &mdash; oops &mdash; on this.

295
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,120
So code mirror is, like, man, I don't want
to have to commit this into project. Of course,

296
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,210
click, I'm writing a talk about Bower, I can
use that. I was just able to point it to the

297
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:19,860
get repo for code mirror. It just pulled it
for me. So even without someone going through

298
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,870
the work of making their project Bower compatible,
I was still able to just throw it in there

299
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:30,090
and use that so you can use that and specify
a tag if you wanted to for a specific version

300
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,520
of that.
>>> Thank you.

301
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,460
>>> On the server side, you have the luxury
of, if two modules require the same thing

302
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,620
but have different version requirements, you
can just load them as dependencies of the

303
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,100
dependencies and each one gets called in for
the correct spot. On the client you can't

304
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:56,100
run JQuery 1.4.2 for one module and 2.0 for
another module. So what's the solution on

305
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,970
the client side for mismatched dependency?
>>Dan Heberden: That will show up on the Bower

306
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:07,180
LS. But it's going to ultimately be your decision
to mitigate that. Because, like you said,

307
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:14,180
there's no easy way out. And so that's where
you making the decision of what to do and

308
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:21,270
which library is going to be the correct one
or will work. We're working on finding out

309
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:25,630
the best way to do that. Like should our process
stop altogether and say there's a conflict

310
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,710
and you have to resolve this first? Or should
we just carry on and hope that you can figure

311
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,980
it out yourself. We're working on some better
feedback on that. It's still, like, it will

312
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,740
still show you that we have two different
versions and you are going to have to figure

313
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:45,280
out which one to put in. But that's where,
again, the developer needs to be the decision

314
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,330
maker and Bower doesn't want to be &mdash; doesn't
need to be a tool that forces you into a box

315
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,310
in particular situations because you might
be very well aware, oh, this person just didn't

316
00:33:54,310 --> 00:34:00,420
update their dependency list. I guess that's
it for questions. Thank you very much for

317
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,220
your attention. Come get a sticker, if you
want.
