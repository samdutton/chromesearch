00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,380
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: All right.

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,370
How's it going everybody?

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,120
My name is Nick Mihailovski.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,850
I'm here with Andrew Wales
and Pete Frisella.

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,610
We're on the Google Analytics
developer relations team.

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,730
Today we're really excited to
talk to you about cross-device

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,890
optimization using
Google Analytics.

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,140
We changed the title last
minute, so don't worry, you

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,590
guys are in the right
presentation.

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,890
We have an awesome presentation
for you today.

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,580
Today we're going to talk
about three big things.

13
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,790
We're going to talk about how
you can measure beyond the web

14
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,670
and app with Google Analytics.

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,790
We have an amazing presentation
about how you can

16
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,580
optimize experiences
across devices.

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,830
And finally, we're going to tie
this all together with how

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,940
you can measure online and
offline experiences together,

19
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,920
all using Google Analytics.

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,290
So let's begin.

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,160
Today we're in the middle of a

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,470
once-in-a-lifetime technology explosion.

23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,530
Wow.

24
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,040
Take a look at Saint
Peter's Square.

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,670
Take a look at the
scene in 2005.

26
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,480
There's one person
on a cellphone.

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,250
I think it's a flip phone.

28
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,140
Like, who uses a flip
phone today?

29
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,486
Now fast forward to 2013.

30
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:11,160
There's a million devices, many
different devices that

31
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,730
people are using.

32
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,780
What's amazing is that these
devices are different.

33
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,660
We see tablets, we
see smartphones.

34
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,700
In fact, at the end of the day,
people are using more

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,090
devices than ever before.

36
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,020
And our data shows that, within
the United States, 90%

37
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,930
of users have three
or more devices.

38
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,820
So I want to take a
quick poll here.

39
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,870
Raise your hand if you
have, personally,

40
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,220
three or more devices.

41
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,410
That's a huge amount
of people.

42
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,340
Now keep your hand up.

43
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,620
I want to see who has the
highest number of devices.

44
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,860
Keep your hand up if
you have 4 devices.

45
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,300
5 devices.

46
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,779
6.

47
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,258
7.

48
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:49,751
8.

49
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:50,244
Wow.

50
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,723
9?

51
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:53,202
10?

52
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:55,667
11?

53
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,076
12?

54
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:57,910
PETE FRISELLA: Go by fives.

55
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,480
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Maybe 15?

56
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,970
20 devices.

57
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,870
Seeing two people,
a couple people.

58
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,210
25 devices?

59
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,540
Wow.

60
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,259
You guys definitely
are all winners.

61
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,420
Come by our booth after this.

62
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,300
We'll give you a cool little
Google Analytics Android box.

63
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,460
The fact of the matter is, as
you saw, everybody's using

64
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,070
many devices.

65
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,770
So something else magical
happened in 2005.

66
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,860
Can anybody guess what it is?

67
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,150
That was the year we launched
Google Analytics.

68
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,830
And so when we launched Google
Analytics, we built a piece of

69
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,550
tracking code for the
web that included a

70
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,830
lot of client logic.

71
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,800
And that data got sent to
Google Analytics using

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,990
something we call the utm.gif.

73
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,850
A couple years later,
we launched V1 of

74
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,510
our application tracking.

75
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,360
What we had to do, is we had to
port all that client logic

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,750
and the complexity into Java
and into Objective-C to

77
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,180
support our Android
and iOS SDKs.

78
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,390
As we look to the future, what
we really want to do is

79
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,520
support measuring users
across any devices.

80
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,110
And so, because it was so
complex to port our code, we

81
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,360
completely rewrote our
infrastructure for collection.

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,910
And we released something
what we call

83
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,280
the measurement protocol.

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,230
And we released this maybe
a couple months ago.

85
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,750
And the measurement protocol is
an easy to use way to send

86
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,370
data to Google Analytics
from any devices.

87
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,800
So all of a sudden, you now
have a way to measure

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,530
interactions with game consoles,
set-top TV box, even

89
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,200
point of sale system, pretty
much any sort of places where

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,230
you have user interactions.

91
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,020
So let me quickly explain to
you how the measurement

92
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,920
protocol works.

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,840
But before we get into that, we
really need to understand

94
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,480
the Google Analytics
data model and what

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,270
we're trying to represent.

96
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,420
At its core, Google Analytics
represents how users interact

97
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,400
with content.

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,240
For example, this lovely
lady here is buying

99
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,940
flowers for her boyfriend.

100
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,990
In this scenario, the
user is the lady.

101
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,120
And viewing the product page for
flowers is the interaction

102
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,090
that we'd want to track.

103
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,340
So to measure this interaction
with Google Analytics, there's

104
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,090
three pieces of information
we need.

105
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,020
One is we need to identify the
tracking ID which defines the

106
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,960
Google Analytics account
you have.

107
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,130
Two, you would need to identify
what we call the

108
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,900
Client ID, and this represents
an anonymous user.

109
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,190
We represent it with
the cid value.

110
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,850
And finally, we need to
represent the interaction.

111
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,320
We represent it with what
we call the Hit Type.

112
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,550
Within Google Analytics
there's many

113
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,250
different Hit Types.

114
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,529
There's page views, events,
transactions, items, so forth.

115
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,670
So these three values map
into a request to

116
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,100
the measurement protocol.

117
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,040
The protocol is actually
an HTTP request.

118
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,200
To this end point,
google-analytics.com/collect.

119
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,620
You send a Get Request.

120
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,060
You specify version.

121
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,890
And then you have the
three values.

122
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,050
You have the tid, which
is your UA number.

123
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,130
You have the cid, which is
the anonymous User ID.

124
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,430
You have the Hit Type, in
this case is a pageview.

125
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,330
And finally is flowers.

126
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,590
It's that easy.

127
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,840
And to send this data, if I go
back into this screen here, in

128
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,010
the back here I have Google
Analytics real time report.

129
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,690
So all I need to do is grab
this URL, open a browser

130
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,860
window, hit Enter &mdash;

131
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,600
hopefully, if everything
works, boom.

132
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,970
We see the data directly
in real time reports.

133
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,040
That's how easy it is to send
data to Google Analytics.

134
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,760
Now, the user interaction
model is super flexible.

135
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,410
And the measurement protocol
is really easy to use.

136
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,080
So you can take this model and
apply it to many different

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,250
scenarios that might not even
have to do with websites.

138
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,670
For example, here's my Google
employee badge.

139
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,760
Inside of it is an RFID chip,
and on the chip has my

140
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,730
employee ID.

141
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,500
That represents the user.

142
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,060
Now, here I have
an RFID reader.

143
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,240
And the reader's hooked up to
Google Analytics, through this

144
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,810
little app here.

145
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,750
So when I scan my badge
over the reader &mdash;

146
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,000
with any luck &mdash;

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,390

148
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,110
Boom.

149
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,000
I see the data directly
in real time reports.

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,430
Now, what's even more amazing
about sending data from any

151
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,570
device, what's really
cool about this &mdash;

152
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,155
let me just go back to my
presentation here &mdash;

153
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:59,660

154
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,580
what's really exciting is that
demo only took five lines of

155
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,870
shell script.

156
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,090
That's how easy it
was to send.

157
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,840
So now anybody can send
data to Google

158
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,450
Analytics from any device.

159
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,100
All right.

160
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,150
Enough fun and games.

161
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,430
Let's look at a real
world application.

162
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,270
In fact, let's take a look at
how the Chrome Dev Rel team at

163
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,840
Google uses the measurement
protocol to

164
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,640
measure their app, Yeoman.

165
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,130
So what is Yeoman?

166
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,800
Yeoman was inspired
by Ruby on Rails.

167
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,080
And the Rails framework makes it
really easy, with a command

168
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,360
line script, to add a couple
commands and get an entire

169
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,160
Ruby web application.

170
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,820
So the Chrome Dev Rel team,
because of the plethora in

171
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,465
growth of all these different
JavaScript frameworks, wanted

172
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,890
to provide a simple command line
tool so developers can

173
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,280
write a couple commands and
they could build all this

174
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,980
structure of framework of their
modern web applications.

175
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,990
So here's the screen
shot of the tool.

176
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,830
And what the developer relations
team wanted to

177
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,120
understand was how many people
are actually using this tool.

178
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,050
So when they started looking
at the problem, the first

179
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,920
question that came to mind &mdash; you
know, the first thought &mdash;

180
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,480
they were like, yeah, we'll
use App Engine.

181
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,225
App Engine's powerful.

182
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:00,980
It's easy.

183
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,440
It gives us all the power.

184
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,470
But when they started looking
at the problem of what they

185
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,340
had to solve, they had to write

186
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,250
collection to collect logs.

187
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,640
They had to write some
asynchronous tasks to process

188
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,440
those logs into reports.

189
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,260
They had to build a front end
to display all the reports,

190
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,610
and potentially even get into
some visualizations to make it

191
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,540
all look pretty.

192
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,150
Now, that's a lot of work.

193
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,260
And when we showed them the
measurement protocol, it was

194
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,620
very easy to see why using
Google Analytics in the

195
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,420
protocol would save
them so much time

196
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,010
and be so much easier.

197
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,710
So they implemented the
measurement protocol in this

198
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,870
application.

199
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,530
And when users actually use the
app for the first time,

200
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,540
they're prompted with a simple
little opt-in to collect

201
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,110
anonymous data to Google.

202
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,850
When the user approves that,
we create a random ID that

203
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,010
gets stored on disk.

204
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,110
And that's what we use
for the Client ID.

205
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,440
Now, every command that the user
uses is actually sent as

206
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,780
an event to Google Analytics.

207
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,570
So all of a sudden, they can
log into the report and see

208
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,730
exactly how many people
are using their app.

209
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,050
And this is huge.

210
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,830
This is huge because they're not
tracking installs, they're

211
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,240
tracking active users using the
unique visitors metric.

212
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,740
In fact, this is one of the most
popular things they use

213
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,210
during performance review time
because they can actually

214
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,570
quantify the impact their team
has on growing the adoption of

215
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,070
this product.

216
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,500
What's nice about this is Google
has a lot of features

217
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,970
out of the box, Google
Analytics does.

218
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,360
And so one of the business
questions that they have is,

219
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,270
what is the actual impact of
their outreach efforts?

220
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,660
And so the team actually goes
around the globe, speaks at

221
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,460
many events like I/O. One of the
events is called G-Kenya,

222
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,049
and it's actually part of our
Africa outreach event.

223
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,850
And at one of those events
they talked the Yeoman

224
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,659
product, and so they
were curious.

225
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,770
Like, what was the last amount
of people who actually used

226
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,650
the product?

227
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,360
And here, directly in analytics,
they can now tell

228
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,340
whether that event
was effective.

229
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,970
Effectively, they're using
Google Analytics to tell

230
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,740
people that they should travel
around the world.

231
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,590
It's pretty amazing.

232
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,400
And finally, they're using
analytics to show what are the

233
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,220
actual applications people
are using and frameworks.

234
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,780
And this is great, because when
they started looking at

235
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,850
their development cycle and
saying, where should I focus

236
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,110
my time and effort, they could
see what were the top

237
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,560
languages people used and then
incorporate these as the

238
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,270
default setting, so people
don't actually have to

239
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,740
download them independently.

240
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,810
So the measurement protocol with
Google Analytics gives

241
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,560
the developers of any
application the ability to

242
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,220
measure how users use
their application.

243
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,740
With that, I want to turn it
to Andrew to talk about

244
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,405
cross-device optimization.

245
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:25,740
ANDREW WALES: Awesome.

246
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,990
Thanks, Nick.

247
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,260

248
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,930
So Nick just showed you how you
can send data to Google

249
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,150
Analytics from pretty much any
connected environment really

250
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,690
easily, using the measurement
protocol.

251
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,670
And that's really awesome.

252
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,920
In this next section, I want to
show you some things we're

253
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,910
working on to make it easier
for you to actually analyze

254
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,775
that data and to build better
cross-device experiences for

255
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:51,690
your users.

256
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,270
So I want to start
with User ID.

257
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,390

258
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,470
Now, you saw in Nick's demo,
when he was sending those hits

259
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,000
with the measurement protocol,
he was using a field called

260
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,580
the Client ID, or cid.

261
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,670
And this has been around in
Google Analytics for a while.

262
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,010
Basically, it's an anonymous
ID that represents a single

263
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,050
user on a single
client device.

264
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,340
So if I'm using your web app on
my smartphone, I have one

265
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,910
Client ID that represents
me using that phone

266
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,040
in GA, Google Analytics.

267
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,370
Now, if I access your site on
a desktop, I'm going to get

268
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,110
another Client ID, a unique
one, that GA's

269
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,470
going to use as well.

270
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,520
And this is going
to keep going.

271
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,950
So if I use your web app on five
different devices, I have

272
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,490
as many as five different
unique Client IDs in GA.

273
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,540
Now, this can be fine if you
want to do analysis of my

274
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,400
experience with your
app on one device.

275
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,470
So if you want to say,
OK, how's Andrew

276
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,320
using my app on a desktop?

277
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,890
That's fine.

278
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,340
No problem.

279
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,030
You can definitely do that.

280
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,090
Where it gets tricky, and where
we run up against a

281
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,780
little bit of a barrier, is
when you start asking

282
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,140
questions about, how is Andrew
using my product across all

283
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,920
these different devices?

284
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,650
For example, how many devices
in total do I use

285
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,510
to access your app?

286
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,970
How much revenue do I generate
across all of

287
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,640
my devices for you?

288
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,750
This is where Client ID starts
to feel a little bit like some

289
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,070
walls that we run up against
in analytics today.

290
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,060
So we're introducing a brand
new ID called User ID.

291
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,380
And the difference here is
that User ID is going to

292
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,820
represent a single user across
all of their devices.

293
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,470
And with that User ID, we can
start to break down those

294
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,580
walls and start to answer some
of these really cool

295
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,740
cross-device questions.

296
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,440
Let me show you a really simple
example of how this is

297
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,690
going to improve GA reporting.

298
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,120

299
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,090
So let's say Pete's using my
web app on his smartphone.

300
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,470
And you can see here, GA
has generated for him a

301
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,970
unique Client ID.

302
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,420
And in my reports, he's
considered one unique visitor.

303
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,130
Now this is fine.

304
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,620
All's well and good, until Pete
decides he wants to go

305
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,790
get himself a tablet.

306
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,580
Good for Pete.

307
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,690
But bad for me.

308
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,450
Because now, when he uses
my app, he's got a

309
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,460
new Client ID, right?

310
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,290
It's unique.

311
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,640
And GA is saying, great, now
I've got two unique users.

312
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,930
Well, I know there's actually
only one Pete.

313
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,340
He's irreplaceable.

314
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,640
But he's using two devices.

315
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,290
And as this continues on, he
gets more and more devices, he

316
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,120
shows up as more and more unique
visitors on my reports.

317
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,960
This gets to be a problem,
because I actually only have

318
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,800
one user, but here it's
saying I have three.

319
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,340
So let's do this again
using User ID.

320
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,170
So now Pete's using my app
on his smartphone.

321
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,890
And when he signs in &mdash; because
this is actually a signed-in

322
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,370
experience.

323
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,510
When he signs in, I'm going to
take his User ID from my auth

324
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,480
system and I'm going
to send it to GA in

325
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,340
this new uid field.

326
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,100
And I'm going to do the very
same thing when he does this

327
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,150
on his tablet, and when he
does it on his laptop.

328
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,100
And you can see, as he keeps
accessing my app, the number

329
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,410
of unique visitors
stays the same.

330
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,660
Because GA now understands this
is one user with three

331
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,910
different devices.

332
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,060

333
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,210
So User ID.

334
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,100
It's going to enable
cross-device reporting.

335
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,430
It's really best for signed-in
experiences.

336
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,910
So where you have an auth system
that has an ID that's

337
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,220
stable that represents a
particular user across all

338
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,660
these different devices.

339
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,570
And that ID has to be
non-personally-identifiable.

340
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,690
And this is really important.

341
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,780
Because you can't send
personally-identifiable data

342
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,990
to Google Analytics.

343
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,080
So please, for example, don't
use my Social Security number

344
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
and send it into GA.

345
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,750
That is not a good idea.

346
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,120
Don't do it.

347
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,790
It's really easy to
actually do this.

348
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,060
So this is an example of using
our analytics.js library,

349
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,400
which is our new JavaScript
library that's built on top of

350
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,090
the measurement protocol.

351
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,600
And mostly we've kind of
abstracted out the

352
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,540
complexities of auth.

353
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,780
But most of the work in GA is
being done with just this one

354
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,420
line, this set API where you
can just say, if you have a

355
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,670
User ID, if somebody's signed
in, you can get it and set it

356
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,290
to this uid parameter.

357
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,460
And now when you send this page
view, it's going to send

358
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,610
that uid along with it.

359
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,980
It's pretty straightforward.

360
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,000
So you see now it's really easy
now to send data from any

361
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,170
connected environment using
the measurement protocol.

362
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,020
And I just showed you how you
can use User ID to have this

363
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,530
idea, this notion,
representation of a user

364
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,510
across all their different
devices.

365
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,800
Now I want to show you some new
reports we're working on

366
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,720
to help you actually analyze all
this data and to do some

367
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,220
pretty cool optimizations.

368
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,060
I want to show you
three reports.

369
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,540
The first is the Device
Overlap report.

370
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,630
Second is the Device
Paths report.

371
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,170
And the third is the Acquisition
Source report.

372
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,590
So I'm going to start with the
Device Overlap report.

373
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,885
And this is brand
new, by the way.

374
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,720
It's a sneak peak.

375
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,980
We've never shown it before, so
I'm very excited to show it

376
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,860
to you today.

377
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,450
So the Device Overlap report is
all about allowing you to

378
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,020
segment users and outcomes like
conversions, revenue, by

379
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,250
different device combinations.

380
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,090
So let me show you
what I mean.

381
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,330
So suppose Nick is using my
app on his tablet, then he

382
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,980
moves to the desktop and he uses
my app there as well, and

383
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,230
he actually does an in-app
purchase for

384
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,300
$3.99 This is great.

385
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,550
Great for me.

386
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,630

387
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,730
If you did this without using
User ID and you looked in GA

388
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,860
before these new cross-device
reports, you might see

389
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,550
something like this where you
see Nick represented as two

390
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,150
unique visitors.

391
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,500
And if somebody asks you, well,
what's the value of

392
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,380
tablet here in this
interaction?

393
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,160
You look at this report and it's
really hard to figure out

394
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,450
what the value was.

395
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,800
You would be totally reasonable
in saying, eh,

396
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
tablet really doesn't have
much value here.

397
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,920
We should get more desktop
users, right?

398
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,870
Because that guy spent $3.99.

399
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,560
It's actually the same person,
but we can't tell that.

400
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,080
So you're missing a little
bit of the picture there.

401
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,970
Now let's do this again with
User ID and cross-device

402
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,330
measurement.

403
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,170
It's actually Pete.

404
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,770
So Pete's actually signed
in now, and I'm

405
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,260
sending Pete's User ID.

406
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,960
Now with the new Device Overlap
report, look at the

407
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,770
difference.

408
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,630
We're able to say, you actually
had just one user.

409
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,150
They used a combination of
desktop and tablet, which is

410
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,470
actually what happened.

411
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,870
And that combination of desktop
and tablet led to

412
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,010
$3.99 in revenue.

413
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,610
So if somebody asks you, what's
the value of tablet,

414
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,280
you can say, well,
this is great.

415
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,320
Actually, in combination
with desktop, it

416
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,210
produced $3.99 in revenue.

417
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,500
So that's the Device
Overlap report.

418
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,340
Allows you to segment users
and outcomes by device

419
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,590
combinations.

420
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,970

421
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,575
Next, I'm going to show you
the Device Paths report.

422
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:44,140

423
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,940
This report's all about
segmenting users and outcomes

424
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,240
by device paths.

425
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,530
So not overlap this
time, but paths.

426
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,670
So let me show you
what that means.

427
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,760
So I just showed you how you
can now use combinations of

428
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,320
devices as segments, right?

429
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
So we were able to see
that Pete used

430
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,120
both desktop and tablet.

431
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,770
That's pretty cool.

432
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,599
Wouldn't it also be cool if you
could segment by paths?

433
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,040
So not just the fact that Pete
used both together, but that

434
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,680
he moved from one to another
in a specific order.

435
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,300
And what could you
learn from that?

436
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,310
So that's the Device
Paths report.

437
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,220
This is brand new.

438
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,410
We've really never had
anything quite

439
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,220
like this in GA before.

440
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,240
And what you'll see here on
the left, this is the

441
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,170
sequencer view.

442
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,220
You'll see all the top paths
users are taking across

443
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,930
different device types.

444
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,350
And then on the right side,
you'll see all their

445
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,550
engagement metrics, including
outcomes like revenue,

446
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,430
transactions, et cetera.

447
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,050
Now, one of my favorite
features &mdash; oops.

448
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,630
Let me back up.

449
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,470
One of my favorite features
about this report &mdash;

450
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,980
so I'm really interested
in revenue, right?

451
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,770
As probably most people
are who have apps

452
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,460
that are out there.

453
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm really interested in the
paths that actually lead up to

454
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,660
transactions because I want to
try to maximize the number of

455
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,390
people I can drive through those
most profitable paths.

456
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,210
So using the sequencer options,
I can say, just show

457
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,320
me all the paths that led
up to a transaction.

458
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm just interested in those.

459
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,670
And actually, here I'm only
going to see the last two.

460
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,090
So when we do that, this
is what we get.

461
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,590
And look at that third
row there.

462
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,610
This is actually pretty cool.

463
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,410
Because we can see that this
specific path, when people

464
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,250
move from desktop to tablet,
this is ridiculously

465
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,100
profitable for me.

466
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,990
Look at that revenue, the
number of transactions.

467
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,820
This is really awesome.

468
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,750
One of the things I might do
after looking at this is to

469
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,440
create a promo on the desktop
that says, hey, if you have a

470
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,730
tablet, come check us
out on the tablet.

471
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,100
Because I know when people move
from desktop to tablet,

472
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,650
they're more likely
to purchase.

473
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,000
And when they do purchase,
they purchase a lot more.

474
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,320
Just one example of the insights
you can pull out of

475
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,880
the Device Paths report.

476
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,660
And again, this is all about
segmenting users and outcomes

477
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,230
by device paths, not
combinations.

478
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,280
One last report I want
to show you is the

479
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,780
Acquisition Source report.

480
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,710
This report's about
getting true

481
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,550
acquisition value by device.

482
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,650
And once again, this has really
never been possible in

483
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,900
GA before today.

484
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,400

485
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,950
So let me run through
another scenario.

486
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,030
So Nick's using my app.

487
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,430
I only have two users,
Nick and Pete.

488
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,000
Hopefully some of you,
maybe later.

489
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,890
So this app's being
used by Nick.

490
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,720
He makes a $0.99 purchase.

491
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,140
Then he uses my app on a tablet
and he makes a $2.99

492
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,625
in-app purchase.

493
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,870
It's fantastic.

494
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,440
And he loves this so much that
he actually makes a $14.99

495
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,050
in-app purchase on
the desktop.

496
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,600
This is great.

497
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,880
Now, if we looked at this in GA
today, without using User

498
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,470
ID, without using any of the new
cross-device reports, we

499
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,860
might get a report that looks
like this, right?

500
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,870
We have three unique visitors.

501
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,650
They're split across desktop,
tablet, and mobile.

502
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,230
And if somebody were to ask
you, well, what's the

503
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,860
acquisition value of tablet?

504
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,330
Or, sorry &mdash; of mobile.

505
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,140
You'd look at this report and
you'd say, well, we acquired

506
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,970
one user for mobile and they
made a $0.99 purchase, right?

507
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,390
So it's not nothing,
but it's not a lot.

508
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,360
And you might actually
say, well,

509
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,620
desktop generated $14.99.

510
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,970
So maybe that's the better
acquisition channel, right?

511
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,260
Maybe we should try to get
people coming through on

512
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,220
desktop instead of mobile.

513
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,660
Let's do this again using
User ID and the new

514
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,400
cross-device reports.

515
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,380
So here's the same
interaction.

516
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,855
Now Nick is signing in, so I'm
sending his User ID to GA.

517
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:28,080

518
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,350
And here's what we
get with the new

519
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,150
Acquisition Source report.

520
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,960
We're able to see that there
was just one user, that we

521
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,630
acquired them through mobile.

522
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,790
And here's the really cool part,
we can see that on the

523
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,980
originating touch point, which
was that original mobile

524
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,500
phone, we generated
$0.99 in revenue.

525
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,690
But the really awesome thing is,
now we can see, because we

526
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,010
have User ID that's tying all
this together, we can see on

527
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,060
all these other touch points,
all these other devices, Nick

528
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,440
actually spent $17.98
more, incremental.

529
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,770
So now when somebody asks you,
well, what's the acquisition

530
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,570
value of mobile, you can say,
well, it's $0.99, but then

531
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,730
they went off and spent $18.

532
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,540
This is actually a really great
acquisition channel.

533
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,400
You'd have the exact opposite
conclusion.

534
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
This actually does work.

535
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,800
It's just that you couldn't
really see it before.

536
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,635
But now with User ID,
and the Acquisition

537
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:16,900
Source report, you can.

538
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,700

539
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,570
So Acquisition Source.

540
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,730
Get true acquisition
value by device.

541
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,790

542
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,560
So just to summarize what
I've covered so far.

543
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,420
User ID, it enables cross-device
measurement in

544
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,380
Google Analytics.

545
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,890
It should be
non-personally-identifiable.

546
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,100
And I'll say that again.

547
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,440
Non-personally-identifiable.

548
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,240
And right now it's in a limited
pilot, and we'll have

549
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,300
more details about when
it's coming to

550
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,250
you guys pretty soon.

551
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,510
I also showed you three new
cross-device reports.

552
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,990
And these are going to enable
cross-device analysis, and

553
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,390
they're all built on top
of using User ID.

554
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,800
And these reports are coming
soon, and we're going to have

555
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,520
some more information for
you soon about when

556
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,770
you can expect those.

557
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,910

558
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,235
Cool.

559
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:08,380
So now I want to pass
it off to Pete.

560
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,340
He's going to talk a
little bit about

561
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,100
measuring online to offline.

562
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,584
PETE FRISELLA: Great.

563
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,036
Thanks, Andrew.

564
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:13,520
All right.

565
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,860
So Nick gave us some really
cool demos with the

566
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,080
measurement protocol.

567
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,975
And you can do some really
awesome things with the

568
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:19,510
measurement protocol.

569
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,060
It's pretty exciting.

570
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,970
Andrew introduced User ID,
which allows us to do the

571
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,980
cross-device measurement.

572
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,920
So I'm going to take a look now,
let's put these things

573
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,330
together and see how we can use
that to actually combine

574
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,680
online with offline
measurement.

575
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,310

576
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,520
So why is online and offline
measurement important?

577
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,550
Like, why do we care?

578
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,300
Well, if you think about the
way people interact and the

579
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,180
way users interact with your
business or your services

580
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,710
these days, a lot of times
they'll start the online

581
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,340
interaction, and then actually
conclude in the offline world.

582
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,270
So maybe they will do some
research online, look at a

583
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,860
product they really enjoy, and
then visit the store and make

584
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,520
the purchase there.

585
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,770
So when we think about a lot
of these situations like in

586
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,450
retail where this happens, how
to get those two to connect

587
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,350
and how do we find that path
from the online campaign all

588
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,380
the way through to that
final purchase?

589
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,280
All right.

590
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,790
So this is important.

591
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,890
And it's not just for retail.

592
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,800
There's things like, maybe
someone purchases a ticket

593
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,650
online and then they visit the
event, the venue, and they use

594
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,680
the ticket there.

595
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,250
Or perhaps they purchase
something and then return it

596
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,090
and come back again.

597
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,130
So these offline and online
interactions are taking place

598
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,040
all the time, right?

599
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,940
So from a customer perspective,
you want to know

600
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,190
that particular path.

601
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,050

602
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,940
So when we think about the
measurement problem and why

603
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,010
this is important, and how it
looks today, this is a very

604
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,920
basic and simple report.

605
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,950
But it tells a story.

606
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,590
If you were to ask somebody,
based on what you see here,

607
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,330
what's the outcome or what do
you think happened for this

608
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,490
particular set of campaigns, I
think the likely conclusion

609
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,670
would be, well, they all seem
to perform reasonably well,

610
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,310
but they're all kind
of the same.

611
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,340
They're all generated around
$25,000 or so in revenue.

612
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,000
So if you were to follow up and
ask, OK, well, is there

613
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,600
any particular campaign we
should probably pay more

614
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,250
attention to?

615
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,750
Maybe one that we want
to optimize or

616
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,930
spend more money on?

617
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,470
It would really be difficult
to find this,

618
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,090
to determine this.

619
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,890
But we just talked about how a
lot of times you have online

620
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,130
interactions that end up
concluding offline.

621
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,100
So we know that data's out
there and it exists.

622
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,180
So we probably want to make
decisions for that complete

623
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,260
story, and not just
this online story.

624
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,530
So in that sense, what you
really want is probably

625
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,900
something that looks like this,
where you have your

626
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,660
offline and your online revenue
together in one place.

627
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,150
And now you have a completely
different story, right?

628
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,240
If you ask those same questions
again, what do you

629
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,870
think happened here, what
campaigns perform really well,

630
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,140
now you see there's something
that happened here that wasn't

631
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,940
apparent before.

632
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,270
It's that one of your campaigns
generated a large

633
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,290
amount of offline revenue.

634
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,460
And now you can say, well,
what should we

635
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,220
spend more time on?

636
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,140
And the answer is a lot
more clear now.

637
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,570
We should probably look at
the newsletter in May.

638
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,320
I don't know what we did there,
but something generated

639
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,300
a lot of offline
revenue, right?

640
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,410
So this makes a lot
of sense, right?

641
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,520
We want to know these two
combined to give us some good

642
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,130
optimization possibilities and
what the actual paths that

643
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,200
people are taking from
online to offline.

644
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,580
Everybody kind of gets this
and understands this.

645
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,960
But we really want to be able
to have this data in GA.

646
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,840
So let's look at
how we do this.

647
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,370
How do we actually implement
something like this using what

648
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,050
we know about measurement
protocol and the

649
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,660
Client and User ID?

650
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,300
So the first thing we want to
do is step back and think

651
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,830
about the User ID and this
Client ID concept.

652
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,840
So which one should you use to
implement online to offline?

653
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,600
There's two things
to think about.

654
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,270
The first thing is, do you
have a consistent way to

655
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,470
identify the user?

656
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,910
And this goes back to what
Andrew was talking about the

657
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,210
User ID, right?

658
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,720
So if you do have a consistent
way to identify users, maybe

659
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,730
through a sign on or an
auth system, then you

660
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,610
want to use User ID.

661
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,606
So when that's available, use
User ID, and that's going to

662
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:45,760
be a stable ID that you
have and provide.

663
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,530
So it could be an auth system,
it could be like a loyalty

664
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,550
card or something.

665
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,050
It's just a way to identify
that user.

666
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,900
If you don't have that, then
you can still do this.

667
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,580
You just want to use
the Client ID.

668
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,580
And we have a mechanism that
allows you to extract that

669
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,420
Client ID that we've set for you
through Google Analytics.

670
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,510

671
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,630
OK.

672
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,980
So now we understand maybe
which ones we should use.

673
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,680
Let's look at how we'd actually
implement this on a

674
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,940
real-life scenario
using User ID.

675
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,560
So the scenario is, we have a
retail store, Daily Deals.

676
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,710
And there's an online
component in

677
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,600
this offline purchase.

678
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,690
So typically, you'd see
something like, a user visits

679
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,300
a site, they would sign on and
when they do that we would

680
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,650
know what user this is.

681
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,170
Like, who does this belong
to, this account?

682
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,240
We'd have that information.

683
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,100
So we have a User ID.

684
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,380
Maybe browse the site a little
bit, look around to see what

685
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,520
they enjoy.

686
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,060
Maybe there's a new deal that
they really want to take

687
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,140
advantage of, so they'll
print off a coupon.

688
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,580
And this is your online
component now.

689
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,310
They've completed that, and now
they're going to the store

690
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,590
with the coupon.

691
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,340
So from the in-store purchase it
looks something like this.

692
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,260
Visitor visits the store
with their coupon.

693
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,940
And now that they have the
coupon, we actually know that

694
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,340
it belongs to Andrew because he
printed it off and we know

695
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,200
which coupon this was printed
off for which user.

696
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,770
And he uses that coupon
to make a purchase.

697
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,600
And finally the transaction
concludes and we have the

698
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,790
complete cycle from online
to offline interactions.

699
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,900
This is what we all know
what happens today.

700
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,940
But how do we apply GA to this
scenario to get that report

701
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,100
where we see those two,
online and offline

702
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,350
revenue, come together?

703
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,760

704
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,870
Well, the first thing you want
to do is enable online

705
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,620
management with the User ID.

706
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,860
This is the important part.

707
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,030
When you send in hits to Google
Analytics, you want to

708
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,900
make sure that you set the User
ID, this stable ID that

709
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,850
you have, because you have an
auth system and you have

710
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,780
signed in, right?

711
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,500
The second thing you want to do
is, in the in-store side of

712
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,440
things, from the point of sale,
because we have the

713
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,610
measurement protocol, now you
can send hits from pretty much

714
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,140
anywhere, including point
of sale systems.

715
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,380
So at that point, what you
want to do is send the

716
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,180
transaction to Google Analytics,
you want to make

717
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,180
sure you set the user ID
in that situation.

718
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,830
And the thing that's maybe not
100% obvious, but is important

719
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,750
here, is what the coupon
actually accomplishes.

720
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,470
The coupon is what
actually ties

721
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,010
these two things together.

722
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,420
It allows us to encode the User
ID into the coupon, for

723
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,387
example, which we then
can extract in

724
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:07,095
the in-store purchase.

725
00:28:07,095 --> 00:28:10,690
So this actually makes
the connection.

726
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,800
So let's look at number one, the
step where we want to do

727
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,200
online measurement
with the ID.

728
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,860
You've seen this before,
it's the same as what

729
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,090
Andrew showed you.

730
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,530
Because you have an auth system,
you want to get the

731
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,330
User ID, and you want to set
it when you send hits to

732
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,580
Google Analytics.

733
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,760

734
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,870
The second step is the
in-store purchase.

735
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,560
So again, we have the
measurement protocol.

736
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,840
At that time, we want to make
sure we set the User ID to the

737
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,020
same ID that we had from the
online coupon when they

738
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,550
printed that, and we want to
send the transaction value

739
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,430
when it actually takes place.

740
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,180
So this will actually tie the
offline purchase back to that

741
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,793
online interaction,
and going back all

742
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,043
the way to the campaign.

743
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:50,090

744
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,690
So that was retail, but it's
just not retail, right?

745
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,800
You can use this for a lot
of different things.

746
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,290
If you have a loyalty card, that
gives you a nice, stable

747
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,140
ID that you can use for these
different channels.

748
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,570
Memberships, tickets, all these
things you can encode

749
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,770
these User IDs into, and then
at the time of redemption or

750
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,080
the offline interaction, you can
get that User ID back out

751
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,997
and pass it along to
GA with the hit.

752
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,860

753
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,630
So that was User ID.

754
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,870
Let's look at Client ID.

755
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,870
So maybe you don't have an auth
system or you don't have

756
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,050
a way to get a stable ID across
different channels.

757
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,950
We do have the Client ID.

758
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,620
That's the ID that's generated
by Google Analytics.

759
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,660
So if we look at this scenario,
it's kind of a test

760
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,260
drive scenario where you're
interested in a car and you

761
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,763
want to book a test drive, or
you want some more information

762
00:29:29,763 --> 00:29:32,450
about the car.

763
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,550
So the same scenario.

764
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,970
You have an anonymous ID user
that comes to the site.

765
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,360
They might do a little bit of
research about the car and

766
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,240
what they're looking for.

767
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,190
It might not be there.

768
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,730
And they'll fill out a form,
and that form will get

769
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,930
submitted to a CRM system, so
a Customer Relationship

770
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,640
Management system, and within
there it'll generate a lead.

771
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,650
So that's the online component
of this scenario.

772
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,490
Then you have the
car salesman.

773
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,360
And this guy, looks very
familiar to Nick, comes along

774
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,630
and he grabs that lead out
of the CRM system.

775
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,510
And he calls up the customer.

776
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,420
And he talks to him.

777
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,550
And he's really good at what he
does, so he convinces the

778
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,910
guy to book a test drive.

779
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,930
That's all he does.

780
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,640
All he does is just book
test drives, Nick.

781
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,370
And once he's done that, he
indicates in the CRM system,

782
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:21,000
OK, we move this prospect or
customer from a new lead to a

783
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,750
booked event.

784
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,400
So this customer's gone through
this conversion.

785
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,080
So how do we apply analytics to
this to make sure that we

786
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,950
connect this offline test drive
booked component back to

787
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,350
that online behavior that
initially got him to the site,

788
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,290
and what research that they
may have done before that?

789
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,210
So in this case, to implement
Google Analytics, you want to

790
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,170
make sure that you have
analytics implemented on the

791
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:43,920
site in general.

792
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,480
So across all the
site you should

793
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,650
have analytics installed.

794
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,370
The second thing we want to
do is send the Client ID

795
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,070
with the form POST.

796
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,610
So we need a way to get that
Client ID out of the tracker,

797
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,280
so the Google Analytics
ID that's provided.

798
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,220
And then we need to send that
to the CRM system so that it

799
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,050
can be saved within the lead.

800
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,145
And then from the CRM's
perspective, when the test

801
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:08,580
drive's actually booked, we need
to get that ID and then

802
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,400
send the hit back to Google
Analytics using

803
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,930
that same Client ID.

804
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,820
So let's see how that looks.

805
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,400
Let's see how the first
step looks.

806
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,110
So for the form itself, we want
to submit the Client ID

807
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,860
with the form.

808
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,730
So we need to add a new
field to the form.

809
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,970
In this case, the ID is Client
ID, but it could be any ID,

810
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,310
whatever, of your choosing.

811
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,530
The important thing
is that the form,

812
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,130
the element, is hidden.

813
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,045
And we're going to use this to
set the value for the Client

814
00:31:34,045 --> 00:31:35,440
ID when the form gets posted.

815
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,690
So we have this new element.

816
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,660

817
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,250
And then we add a listener
to the form for

818
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,110
when it gets submitted.

819
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,900
Because we want to know, once
that form gets submitted, we

820
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,540
want to grab the Client ID from
the tracker and we want

821
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,690
to send it to the CRM system
with the actual lead gen.

822
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,960
So the way we do that is,
we have a method, inner

823
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
mechanism, to allow you
to pull the Client

824
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,420
ID out of the tracker.

825
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,930
So that first line there, the
blue line, is how we get that.

826
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,430
So once you have the value, then
you want to set the value

827
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:09,320
of the input element for the
form to that Client ID.

828
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,950
That way, when the form gets
submitted, that value will be

829
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,980
sent along.

830
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,770
And then finally, we just want
to send an event to Google

831
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,720
Analytics to indicate that
there was a new lead gen.

832
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,980
And that's going to use the
Client ID that's part of the

833
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,970
tracker already.

834
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,710
So it's going to be associated
with that particular user's

835
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,960
interactions.

836
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,210

837
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,240
The second part is, we want to
send another event to Google

838
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,210
Analytics from the CRM system to
indicate that this user has

839
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,860
booked with us for
a test drive.

840
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,220
And now it's measurement
protocol,

841
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,830
which is very simple.

842
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,460
At this time, we just want to
make sure we pull up the

843
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,200
Client ID that we saved in the
CRM system, that same ID.

844
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
And we send it along with the
hit to indicate that there was

845
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,470
an event where the test drive
was actually booked.

846
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,220
And that will tie back all of
that interaction across, from

847
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,585
the online to the offline CRM
system, back into Google

848
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:56,400
Analytics, and you'll have that
view of that full path.

849
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,680
All right.

850
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,420
Just to wrap up things here, the
important thing here is,

851
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,550
we want to make that
connection, right?

852
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,370
So if you're doing online
to offline, you use that

853
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,020
connection, use the User ID or
a Client ID to make that

854
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,520
connection.

855
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,190
And that's important.

856
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,610
Once you have that connection,
then you're able to attribute

857
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,200
offline interactions to online
campaigns and online

858
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,600
interactions.

859
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
And once you have that, then
you're able to optimize for

860
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,980
the complete story.

861
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,290
So now I'll pass it
along to Nick.

862
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,800
He's going to finish up.

863
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,390
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
Thanks, Pete.

864
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:23,920
And Andrew.

865
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,170
That was really exciting.

866
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,990
I don't know about you guys,
but this is pretty amazing.

867
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,790
We've covered three
big things today.

868
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,760
We talked about how Google
Analytics is enabling every

869
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,460
developer here who's building
applications to now use Google

870
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,870
Analytics to really
measure usage.

871
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,120
We talked about beautiful
reports of how we can now

872
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,610
optimize across devices, and
how this will enable you to

873
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,870
make better decisions of how
you're building your apps.

874
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,530
And finally, we talked about
getting the true value of your

875
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,550
marketing campaigns by tying
the offline and online

876
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,870
experiences together, all
using Google Analytics.

877
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,530
So there's a couple key
things here of when

878
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,820
this stuff's available.

879
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,960
The measurement protocol
is available now.

880
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,380
What that means is, everybody
here, after this session,

881
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,850
should go look at our developer
docs and implement

882
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,429
Google Analytics in
your applications.

883
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,679
The second thing is User ID.

884
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,850
That's coming soon.

885
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,170
Subscribe to our
+GoogleAnalytics channel and

886
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,820
we'll announce when it's
available for trusted testers.

887
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,320
Finally, all our developer
documentation's on

888
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,219
developers.googl
e.com/analytics.

889
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,409
If you haven't been there,
shame on you.

890
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,239
Go there after this session.

891
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,489
Finally, come see us in the
after hours, where we'll be

892
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,850
answering questions.

893
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,270
Thanks a lot for your
time, guys.

894
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:35,870
[APPLAUSE]

895
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,415
