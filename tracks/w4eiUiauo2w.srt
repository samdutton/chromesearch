1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,185

2
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:11,520
JEFF POSNICK: Hey, everybody.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,720
This is Jeff Posnick with this
week's episode of "YouTube

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,470
Developers Live." And we're
coming to you from New York

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,490
City and we have a
special guest in

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,130
town for today's episode.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,840
It's John Luther, who's the
product manager behind WebM

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,090
and VP8 and all sorts of
other video goodness.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,860
So welcome, John.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,380
JOHN LUTHER: Thank you.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:29,920
Good afternoon.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,355
Good morning.

13
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:31,044
Good night.

14
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:32,780
Good evening, wherever
you happen to be.

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,615
JEFF POSNICK: That's the beauty
of global audience.

16
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:35,010
JOHN LUTHER: That's
the web, right?

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,110
JEFF POSNICK: So you don't know
where you are and when

18
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,270
you're watching.

19
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,270
JOHN LUTHER: Or who's
watching.

20
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,290
JEFF POSNICK: Exactly.

21
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:39,590
Cool.

22
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,590
So before we get started,
there's a lot of acronyms

23
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,030
involved and there's a lot of
specific technical language

24
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,310
that's used when talking about
video codecs and video file

25
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:57,680
formats, and not everybody might
be familiar with them.

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,820
So as not to lose everybody
from the very start of the

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,620
show, maybe we could just go
through some basics to begin

28
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,610
with so folks know what
we're talking about.

29
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,990
JOHN LUTHER: Sure.

30
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,890
JEFF POSNICK: So the phrases
video container, video codec,

31
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,150
and audio codec seem pretty
important to me.

32
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,330
JOHN LUTHER: Yes.

33
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,880
JEFF POSNICK: And maybe you
could go into a little bit

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,420
more about what they all do.

35
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,190
JOHN LUTHER: It's funny you
should mention that because I

36
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,720
happen to have a graphic
for this.

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,250
JEFF POSNICK: I would love to
see the graphic, if we could

38
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,950
bring that up on the screen.

39
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,750
So there we go.

40
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,330
JOHN LUTHER: So when we talk
about video for the web, which

41
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,350
is our focus, I mean,
the WebM project is

42
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,550
named that for a reason.

43
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,930
Our primary focus is on
video for the web.

44
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,110
We're not necessarily interested
in broadcast

45
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,360
television, anything
like that.

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,710
So for web video in most cases
what you have is a container,

47
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,950
which is the file that
contains the media.

48
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,070
So here I've kind of just laid
out all the steps of creating

49
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,440
a video file.

50
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,843
There's roughly the same for a
live stream, but just for that

51
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,490
sake of simplicity
I made this.

52
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:51,860
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

53
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,890
JOHN LUTHER: So you start with
your application, which can be

54
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,215
a camera, a video editing
software, wherever the media

55
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:59,080
is originating from.

56
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,120
And that will export raw media,

57
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,245
video, and audio streams.

58
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:03,560
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

59
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,900
JOHN LUTHER: So then what we
do, like in the case of

60
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,080
YouTube, we put those streams
into VP8 video encoder and a

61
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,400
Vorbis audio coder.

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,850
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

63
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,700
JOHN LUTHER: So the VP8 video
codec is what Google acquired

64
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,885
from On2 Technologies and what
we've been working on for the

65
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:20,870
past, now, almost three years.

66
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,350
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

67
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,810
JOHN LUTHER: Vorbis is an open
source audio format that was

68
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,370
developed by the Xiph
Foundation, Monty, Montgomery,

69
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,160
Tim Terriberry, those guys,
if people are familiar.

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,460
They're also the same guys
who are now working

71
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,950
on Opus audio codec.

72
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,670
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

73
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,850
JOHN LUTHER: So when those
streams get encoded they get

74
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,340
compressed.

75
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,150
So the goal of all this is to
take these raw streams, which

76
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,480
are very, very big, lots of
data, raw pixels, and compress

77
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,430
that down into a stream that's
usable across the internet &mdash;

78
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,695
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

79
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:52,960
JOHN LUTHER: --you
know, megabit

80
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,810
connection, 2 megabits.

81
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,085
So those are then muxed,
multiplexed &mdash;

82
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:57,980
JEFF POSNICK: Yes.

83
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,090
JOHN LUTHER: --into a container
file, which

84
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,480
is your WebM file.

85
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:01,960
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

86
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,560
JOHN LUTHER: So within that you
can have multiple video

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,770
streams, multiple
audio streams.

88
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,470
In most cases you have
one audio, one video.

89
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,870
And then that's what you sort
of put on your server.

90
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,260
MIME type is WebM, so just like
a JPEG file contains a

91
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,180
stream for the still image,
a Word document contains a

92
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,430
stream of English or French.

93
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,740
You kind of think of
it that way, &mdash;

94
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:25,940
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

95
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,120
JOHN LUTHER: --just a
way to wrap it all

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,720
up in a nice package.

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,280
And then when the client, the
web browser, the video tag in

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,760
HTML, then demuxes that,
demultiplexes, it takes the

99
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,800
video stream into the video
decoder, audio stream into the

100
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,080
audio decoder, and then, through
the media pipeline and

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,320
the browser, renders it all
through the screen.

102
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,140
JEFF POSNICK: Cool, OK.

103
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,760
JOHN LUTHER: That's how
the magic happens.

104
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,980
That's the very, very minimal
description of what goes on.

105
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,920
JEFF POSNICK: Fair enough.

106
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,830
So if you hear VP8, we're
talking about the video codec.

107
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,990
JOHN LUTHER: Correct.

108
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,580
JEFF POSNICK: And if you hear
WebM, we're talking about the

109
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,495
overall video file format
containing the muxed streams.

110
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:02,205
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah.

111
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:02,640
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
Hopefully that answers
some questions.

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,845
And one takeaway from the show,
if nothing else, people

114
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:10,060
will understand video file
formats a little bit better.

115
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,530
JOHN LUTHER: Exactly.

116
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:10,860
JEFF POSNICK: Awesome.

117
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,040
OK, so now that we know what
we're talking about, let's get

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,180
into a little bit of the details
as to why somebody

119
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,740
would actually want to use WebM
and VP8 versus some of

120
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,170
the other [INAUDIBLE] and codecs
that are out there.

121
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,560
What are some advantages?

122
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,520
JOHN LUTHER: Well, one of the
advantages of VP8 is that it's

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,250
a very, very efficient codec.

124
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:38,940
I mean, it was developed roughly
2009-ish and then we

125
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,720
acquired it in 2010.

126
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,500
JEFF POSNICK: I was expecting
you to say 2,000 years ago.

127
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,890
JOHN LUTHER: No, no.

128
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,990
JEFF POSNICK: This is a
very ancient codec.

129
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,053
JOHN LUTHER: [INAUDIBLE]
business that long,

130
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:46,790
but not that long.

131
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,930
JEFF POSNICK: Lots of papyrus,
hardware acceleration, stuff

132
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,880
like that, but &mdash;

133
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,060
JOHN LUTHER: We were drawing the
pixels by hand back when I

134
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,900
first started.

135
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,650
JEFF POSNICK: Yes.

136
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:54,900
JOHN LUTHER: No.

137
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,550
So you know, it's a modern
codec, as the parlance goes in

138
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,670
the industry.

139
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,160
It's very, very efficient.

140
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,970
The quality that it delivers
is great, HD as well as

141
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,050
smaller frame sizes.

142
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,020
But also, one of the advantages
of VP8 is that it's

143
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,736
a very low latency codec.

144
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:15,080
JEFF POSNICK: OK, why
does that matter?

145
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,260
JOHN LUTHER: Real-time
applications.

146
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,470
For example, one of the things
that VP8 is proposed for now

147
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:25,690
is the WebRTC project, which
is an open source real-time

148
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,840
media project, for example, for
making video conferencing

149
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,330
applications in the browser.

150
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:30,780
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

151
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,430
JOHN LUTHER: Those
sorts of things.

152
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,200
So at the IETF standards
organization, VP8 has been

153
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,090
proposed as a mandatory codec
for that use case.

154
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,585
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

155
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:41,540
JOHN LUTHER: So what we can do
is with VP8, because the

156
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,690
latency is so small, you can
have these very good video

157
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,360
conferencing applications
where there's no delay.

158
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,280
Even if the network gets kind
of funky, starts dropping

159
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,670
packets, and all sorts of crazy
stuff happens, we can

160
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,900
recover from errors.

161
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,230
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

162
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,860
JOHN LUTHER: Lot
of that stuff.

163
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,240
So we've designed it to be a
very good all around codec.

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,520
But as part of that we wanted
it to be one codec.

165
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,690
We didn't want profiles
and levels.

166
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,590
And there's a lot of
other codecs &mdash;

167
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,820
not necessarily that it's all
bad, but we wanted the design

168
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,280
to be very simple and serve
every use case without having

169
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,250
to have special decoders.

170
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:18,990
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

171
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,450
JOHN LUTHER: So other codecs,
you know when you hear about a

172
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,860
profile in, for example, H.264
baseline profile, they're

173
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,030
actually different codecs.

174
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,410
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

175
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,930
JOHN LUTHER: A baseline decoder
can't decode a high

176
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,110
profile 264 stream.

177
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,130
VP8 is VP8.

178
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,275
A VP8 stream created from a
compliant encoder will play

179
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:38,480
and decode in any VP8 decoder.

180
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,310
So there's simplicity of design,
there's efficiency.

181
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,200
We don't charge any money
for it, which a

182
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,260
lot of people like.

183
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,730
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

184
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,900
JOHN LUTHER: Other codecs
have royalties

185
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,950
associated with them.

186
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,490
We don't charge for VP8.

187
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,300
It's a very wide open license.

188
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,635
It's a BSD open-source
license.

189
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:01,280

190
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,460
There are people out there
using it who aren't even

191
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,870
calling it VP8 and they have
every right to do that.

192
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,575
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

193
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:06,833
JOHN LUTHER: That's [INAUDIBLE]

194
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,640
the license allows.

195
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
So that's &mdash;

196
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,150
you know, overall
high-efficiency and

197
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,260
simplicity of design.

198
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,440
And decoding simplicity goes
with that as well.

199
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,290
I mean, we can decode VP8 on
pretty minimal hardware

200
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,650
[INAUDIBLE] in software.

201
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,510
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

202
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,920
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah.

203
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,090
JEFF POSNICK: That sounds
pretty compelling.

204
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,400
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah.

205
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,950
JEFF POSNICK: Good to know.

206
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,640
OK, so that's a little
bit about VP8.

207
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,910
You mentioned the fact that VP8
kind of initially started

208
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,346
as part of a separate company,
On2, that Google acquired.

209
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:41,300
Can I just hear a little bit
about your history and your

210
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,980
involvement with the
overall project?

211
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,430
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah.

212
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,920
JEFF POSNICK: [INAUDIBLE]

213
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,780
with video working with.

214
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,520
JOHN LUTHER: Let's see.

215
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,730
Well, On2 started as a couple
of people from New York City

216
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,810
and a school in upstate New
York called Rensselaer

217
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,340
Polytechnic Institute.

218
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,010
So they started this company
to initially do video in

219
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,620
gaming systems like the Sega
Saturn and all things &mdash;

220
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,710
JEFF POSNICK: That creates
it a little bit.

221
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,780
JOHN LUTHER: You young people
out there, you might &mdash;

222
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,820
so that was '93, '94.

223
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,450
I came along in 2002.

224
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,280
By then &mdash; when it started it was
called Duck Corporation,

225
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,470
just being silly.

226
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,450
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

227
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,580
JOHN LUTHER: It became On2.

228
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,090
2002 is when I joined.

229
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,000
And then we developed a series
of, you know, the VP3 series,

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,390
VP4, all the way up to VP7.

231
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,400
And then we released
VP8 in 2009.

232
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,809
Google acquired us in 2010.

233
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,460
So I've been doing this
now for 11 years.

234
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,289
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

235
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,169
JOHN LUTHER: Which &mdash;

236
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,866
you know, there are more and
more people who have been

237
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:44,880
doing it that long, but I feel
like I have a lot of

238
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,400
perspective on this stuff.

239
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,330
And it takes a long time.

240
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,220
And a lot of people have said,
or implied, that VP8 hasn't

241
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,410
caught on, but this is pretty
much about when the curve

242
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,010
starts to come.

243
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,220
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

244
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,220
JOHN LUTHER: I mean, I remember
when H.264 was first

245
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,460
ratified as a standard,
that was early 2000s.

246
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,030
It really didn't come into
its own, at least

247
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,930
for the web, until &mdash;

248
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,110
really the iPad is what really
then sort of got everybody

249
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,760
wanting to support it
and everything else.

250
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,960
So I'm very bullish on VP8 for
the next many years, because

251
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,150
there's hardware coming
to market.

252
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,985
We can get into all
that stuff &mdash;

253
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:24,400
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

254
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,980
JOHN LUTHER: For me, that's
my [INAUDIBLE].

255
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,420
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

256
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,270
Well, I mean it's wonderful
having somebody with your

257
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,840
perspective on the show
to talk about this.

258
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,060
JOHN LUTHER: Thanks.

259
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,240
JEFF POSNICK: All right, so
let's say I'm just your

260
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,785
average YouTube consumer.

261
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,100
Like everybody out there, like
everybody who's watching us

262
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,570
right now, I like watching
YouTube videos.

263
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,700
But I'm not necessarily a
developer, and I'm not maybe

264
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,220
creating videos.

265
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,510
So what does WebM mean for me?

266
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,890
Why should I care about WebM?

267
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,340
JOHN LUTHER: Just for your
everyday user they don't

268
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,460
really need to care.

269
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,680
Or at least, we don't want them
to care in the sense that

270
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,420
like, well, I only want to have
this &mdash; all they want is a

271
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,660
really good video experience.

272
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,880
They want it to look good, same
priorities that we have,

273
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,970
but they're going to
frame them in terms

274
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,810
of watching a video.

275
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,160
So it should start fast, it
should seek without a lot of

276
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,150
weird stuttering.

277
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,270
The audio, video should
never go out.

278
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,420
You know, just very good viewing
experience that is

279
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,090
seamless, that's what
they care about.

280
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,660
And we feel like that's sort of
the focus of our project.

281
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,610
That's what we're doing.

282
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,475
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

283
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:31,740
JOHN LUTHER: And our, sort of,
charter, if you will, is to

284
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,780
make video on the web
really great.

285
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,530
Part of that's the codec,
but there's other

286
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,610
parts of it as well.

287
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,260
I also work with Chrome, the
browser, the video stack in

288
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,020
there, making that a really
great experience.

289
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,610
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

290
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,280
JOHN LUTHER: Other WebM partners
like Firefox, we're

291
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,530
all kind of on this mission,
if you will, to take the

292
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,700
technologies that we're
developing and make them great

293
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,080
on the web.

294
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,590
Because historically a lot of
the codecs that have been used

295
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,150
for web video were not designed
for the web, they

296
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,840
were designed for broadcast
television or use cases.

297
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,930
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

298
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,610
JOHN LUTHER: So, yeah.

299
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,440
I mean, we certainly don't want
people to have to feel

300
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,230
like they have to
know essentially

301
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,740
how the codec works.

302
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,660
We don't really want people
to have to know that.

303
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,920
We just want them to be like,
oh, wow, this video looks

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
great, it works great,
I wonder what it- &mdash;

305
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,180
why?

306
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,310
And then you say, well, that's
because it's VP8.

307
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,130
JEFF POSNICK: Gotchya.

308
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,200
JOHN LUTHER: We care
about these things.

309
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,072
So that's why we do it.

310
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:31,660
JEFF POSNICK: And just for some
background on how YouTube

311
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:38,040
is using WebM in embeds, we have
a very extensible iFrame

312
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,910
Embed format now.

313
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,460
And one of the things about the
iFrame Embed is that it'll

314
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,430
kind of try to push the logic
of the video player and the

315
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:52,450
video format to Run-time and not
have to hard code a flash

316
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,930
player, URL, or anything
like that.

317
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,570
So if you are somebody who's
watching a video and it

318
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,330
happens to be embedded with the
iFrame Embed, there's a

319
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,410
good chance that you might be
watching HTML5 video using the

320
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,660
WebM video format
and not know it.

321
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,360
So again, I think
this really &mdash;

322
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,970
not necessarily knowing
it, but you might

323
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,335
already be doing that.

324
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:11,620
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah.

325
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,950
JEFF POSNICK: And, you know, you
might be benefiting from

326
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,930
all those things
that it offers.

327
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,600
So it is definitely relevant
for folks like those.

328
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,350
JOHN LUTHER: And there are cases
where as soon as you're

329
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,880
not using it you might notice.

330
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,120
For example, like I for a while
had a machine that &mdash;

331
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,590
a computer that I won't
name [INAUDIBLE].

332
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,900
And every time I would be
playing video from YouTube and

333
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,720
H.264 the fan would start
running, whereas because one

334
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,085
of our design goals is low
complexity on the decode side,

335
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:43,060
it just never happened on
that machine when I was

336
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,130
using HTML5 with WebM.

337
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,090
So those sorts of things
start to matter

338
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,850
when you notice them.

339
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,400
We don't want anybody to ever
have to notice any of that

340
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,770
stuff, just it works great and
we're doing the big work to

341
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,995
make video on the web great.

342
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:00,675
JEFF POSNICK: Cool.

343
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:01,800
OK.

344
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,010
Yeah, one kind of scenario that
we haven't really talked

345
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,980
about publicly yet but I'm told
it's OK that we mention

346
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,220
it here is that what about
people who want to watch some

347
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,300
of the types of premium YouTube
content on a device

348
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,685
that doesn't support flash?

349
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:18,290
And how does WebM come into
the picture on that?

350
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,430
JOHN LUTHER: So this
is pretty exciting.

351
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:27,950
Last month we rolled out the
Samsung Chromebook devices

352
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,270
that were released last fall,
which have been in very high

353
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,010
demand on Amazon
and elsewhere.

354
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,010
So what we did is we decided
to make that

355
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,980
sort of an HTML5 platform.

356
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,360
That's where we really thought
there was a great case to do

357
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,400
more HTML5 stuff.

358
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,410
So what we did on YouTube Movies
and Play Movies is on

359
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,680
those devices, Samsung
Chromebooks, if you buy or

360
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,800
rent a movie on YouTube Movies
or Play, that's a WebM

361
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,542
experience, that plays WebM.

362
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:59,330
JEFF POSNICK: And previously
you had to do that in flash

363
00:13:59,330 --> 00:13:59,790
player, or &mdash;

364
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,970
JOHN LUTHER: Previously you'd
have to have Flash Player.

365
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,660
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, OK.

366
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,210
JOHN LUTHER: So as far
as I know we're the

367
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,600
first to ever do that.

368
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,450
Because it also uses some things
that we've proposed at

369
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,210
W3C for doing encrypted media
in the browser, media source

370
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:23,060
extensions for HTML, so there's
a dash-like adaptive

371
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,830
streaming going on.

372
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,690
There's a whole bunch of
things and we said

373
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,880
OK, let's do this.

374
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,140
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

375
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,430
JOHN LUTHER: Let's
do it all, end to

376
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,060
end, HTML5, the browser.

377
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,820
There's no flash.

378
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,700
There's no plug-ins.

379
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,520
There's no anything.

380
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,680
That whole experience on that
device is all HTML.

381
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,500
And we'll be rolling that out on
more Chromeless devices and

382
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,820
other platforms soon, all
through the next year.

383
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,880
JEFF POSNICK: And then, again,
this kind of fits into like if

384
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,355
you're someone viewing, you
might not realize what's going

385
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:53,040
on under the hood.

386
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,690
But hopefully for the technical
audience out there,

387
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,390
folks watching this,
it's pretty cool.

388
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,270
It's exciting for
me, certainly.

389
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,470
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah.

390
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,860
It's exciting, you know &mdash;

391
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,350
JEFF POSNICK: If you care about
these types of standards

392
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,210
on the web and getting this type
of playback on more types

393
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,690
of devices, it's very cool.

394
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,820
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah,
that is part of &mdash;

395
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,470
my job is doing the encrypted
media stuff and talking to

396
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,300
people who want to do &mdash;

397
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,090
a lot of content providers they
really want to do HTML5

398
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,050
for a number of reasons.

399
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,390
But primarily because right now
they have an app for this

400
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,950
device, and an app for that
device, and this game console

401
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,990
and they want to just unify all
that into a browser stack,

402
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,520
so s I feel like
that's coming.

403
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,240
And that's really exciting
because finally they'll be

404
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,820
able to just deliver
one experience

405
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,120
any device, any screen.

406
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,090
Under the covers it will
all work the same way.

407
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,280
It makes it really great for
users, first of all, but for

408
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,390
them as well it just simplifies
things greatly for

409
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:50,560
those guys.

410
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,340
JEFF POSNICK: OK, cool.

411
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,160
So we talked a little bit about
the experience of people

412
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,810
who are watching content.

413
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,870
What if you were a
website owner?

414
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,570
And I talked a little bit before
about using the iFrame

415
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,690
Embed for YouTube for enabling
types of rich playback, but

416
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,300
exactly how widespread is WebM
support in the browser

417
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,830
community out there?

418
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,930
What's the chance that folks
visiting your site will have

419
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,200
WebM support in their browser?

420
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,490
JOHN LUTHER: The last numbers
that I ran were a few days ago

421
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,130
and so the native support in the
browser, like WebM is in

422
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,060
there, it's in the video tag,
that's now at about 57% when

423
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:34,330
you combine Chrome, Firefox,
and the Opera browser.

424
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,630
Now, there's also plug-ins
that you can install for

425
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,200
Internet Explorer
to support WebM.

426
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,590
If you then add that on that's
an addressable market &mdash;

427
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:44,790
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

428
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,075
JOHN LUTHER: --of about
another 17%.

429
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:47,380
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

430
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,840
JOHN LUTHER: So the chances
are pretty good, and

431
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,510
particularly with Chrome
and Firefox.

432
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,540
And the performance in
both is very good.

433
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,740
Since we launched it we've made
a lot of refinements.

434
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,580
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

435
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,520
That's good to hear.

436
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,310
So &mdash;

437
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,690
JOHN LUTHER: Oh, I should
mention Android as well.

438
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,530
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

439
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,290
JOHN LUTHER: Ever since
Gingerbread, WebM has been

440
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,140
supported in Android.

441
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,480
JEFF POSNICK: It's a pretty
big platform.

442
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,010
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah, I guess
it is, isn't it?

443
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,500
A few hundred, whatever,
bazillion people.

444
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,339
JEFF POSNICK: There you go.

445
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,260
Don't quote us on that.

446
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,650
JOHN LUTHER: No, that's not
a scientific figure.

447
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,849
Bazillion I don't think is
a real number anyway.

448
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,640
JEFF POSNICK: There you go.

449
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,430
OK, so that's the website
owner point of view.

450
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,610
Let's say a slightly different
scenario, I'm

451
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,890
somebody who's a developer.

452
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,360
Maybe I'm working on a video
creation application, or maybe

453
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,730
I'm just interested in ways of
encoding video for use in my

454
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,580
application because I'm
not doing necessarily

455
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,930
browser-based playback, but I
know I want to have video

456
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,940
playback or even video capture
within my application.

457
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,340
What could WebM do for me?

458
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,240
And do you maybe have some
examples of how you could

459
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,042
interact with WebM
in that case?

460
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,830
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah, I mean this
is one of the great things

461
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,450
about the web and being a
developer is that it depends a

462
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,240
lot on what you want to do
and what your needs are.

463
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,940
If you have a small site and you
do a couple videos a week

464
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,520
you can encode them on your
local desktop with &mdash;

465
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,490
there's a lot of tools now
that support WebM.

466
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,510
But let's say you have a higher
volume site where you

467
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,160
may be getting dozens or
hundreds of videos a week,

468
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,440
there are a lot of really
great cloud-based video

469
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,240
encoding services now where they
have really great APIs.

470
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,590
Most of them are kind
of REST-based.

471
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,015
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

472
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:40,290
JOHN LUTHER: You send a file
in and then they give you a

473
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,660
pointer back to encoder
version.

474
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,140
It's very fast.

475
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,900
They have really good presets.

476
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,950
They take care of a lot of
the tweaking for you.

477
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,620
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

478
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,560
And YouTube does support WebM as
an injection for that also.

479
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:50,820
JOHN LUTHER: Oh, yeah.

480
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,030
Yeah.

481
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,810
JEFF POSNICK: So once you have
your WebM encoded file you

482
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,695
could pass that along to
YouTube, obviously, and store

483
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:56,830
it there and serve it there.

484
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,110
JOHN LUTHER: I mean, there's
companies that are doing that

485
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,570
even behind the scenes.

486
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,940
Some gaming companies and things
are doing that as well.

487
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,410
So then it becomes,
for a developer &mdash;

488
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,310

489
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,080
it's like a lot of things.

490
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,530
You want to focus on the user
experience of the site, making

491
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,710
it work great, reliability,
encoding the videos.

492
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,060
You can do that stuff
in the cloud now.

493
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,110
And it's becoming so much easier
and you don't need a

494
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,070
huge investment in a
lot of hardware.

495
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,230
Because encoding video &mdash;

496
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,000
it's not just VP8, all
video is very compute

497
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,830
intensive to do.

498
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,620
It's just sort of the
nature of the thing.

499
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,480
JEFF POSNICK: That being said,
let's say you are somebody who

500
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,100
wants to do on-device video
encoding, maybe because you're

501
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,120
capturing, game play as part
of a game or something like

502
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,400
that and you want to do the
encoding and then pass it

503
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,890
along to YouTube.

504
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:53,420
JOHN LUTHER: So, yeah, the SDK
that we have is called libvpx.

505
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,720
It's open, it's up on
the site, anything.

506
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,890
Right now that's sort of
mostly the C interface.

507
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,390
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

508
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,680
JOHN LUTHER: We've recently made
some J and I bindings for

509
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,760
that so you can, right in Java,
talk to that SDK through

510
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,730
Java interfaces.

511
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,320
And one of the things that we'd
like the open community

512
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,990
to do is develop more of those
bindings for other &mdash;

513
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,410
because of the nature of
websites and things, not

514
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,230
everybody's out there
hacking in C &mdash;

515
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,010
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

516
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,230
JOHN LUTHER: --and C++.

517
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,730
So Python bindings, and PHP, and
Pearl, or C#, we'd like to

518
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,940
have language bindings to make
this stuff easy for anybody to

519
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,620
just take the SDK and write any
kind of app they want and

520
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,710
have the languages and
interfaces that they're

521
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,900
familiar with, not a steep
learning curve.

522
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,660
And it's sort of like the sky's
the limit for what you

523
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,800
can do with that SDK.

524
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,065
And then again, we don't
charge money for it.

525
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:51,715
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

526
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:52,660
JOHN LUTHER: Anybody
can use it.

527
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,350
Not only use it, but if they
find a bug or improve it then

528
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,440
just send those changes
upstream and we're

529
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,830
happy to take them.

530
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,030
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

531
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,400
So let's say I do want to go
out there and find some

532
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,140
resources for how I
could get started

533
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,870
with doing some encoding.

534
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,250
I assume there is a canonical
website that

535
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,360
folks should go to.

536
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,530
JOHN LUTHER: There is.

537
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,150
JEFF POSNICK: So maybe we can
pull that up on the screen.

538
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,390
JOHN LUTHER: This is the
WebM project site.

539
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,280
It's everything you need to know
about WebM, VP8, also the

540
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,670
experimental codec
work we're doing.

541
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,710
It's all here.

542
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,790
JEFF POSNICK: And it's
webmproject.org?

543
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,630
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah.

544
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:36,540
So developers, this is sort of
more software developers and

545
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,180
web developers as well, but this
is more for maybe people

546
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,080
who want to contribute
to the codec.

547
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,950
The tools section is I think
where this audience might find

548
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,890
a lot of useful stuff.

549
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:51,620
There's a lot of open source
tools that support WebM now.

550
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,600
JEFF POSNICK: It seems like
FFmpeg might be the entry

551
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,050
point that a lot
of people use.

552
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,440
JOHN LUTHER: Yup.

553
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,740
And FFmpeg has been really
great for WebM because it

554
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,990
underlies so much software now
for doing video processing.

555
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,520
Not only open-source stuff, but
a lot of the cloud-based

556
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,110
services, a lot of video sites
use it behind the scenes now.

557
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,850
So these are just some of the
commercial tools, the

558
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,340
cloud-based things.

559
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,890
So if you did want to get
adventurous and start using

560
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,430
FFmpeg to create WebM files,
what I've done here &mdash; this is

561
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:32,620
just a very simple and quick
demo of how you would do that.

562
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,450
So let's find like this one.

563
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,940
So this is just a pretty simple
command to create a

564
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,870
WebM file from a .MoveFile I
have that is a H.264 file.

565
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,510
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

566
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,080
JOHN LUTHER: So what
this is doing

567
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,330
is the quality settings &mdash;

568
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,880
there's sort of different
modes in VP8 for

569
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,170
encoding the video.

570
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,290
There's real-time, good, best.

571
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,710
Good is in most cases, even
though it's a little bit

572
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,340
non-intuitive, good is
usually what you want

573
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,690
because it's faster.

574
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,330
Best is designed for squeezing
the absolute best out of it,

575
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,830
but it's going to take a
lot more processing.

576
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,410
JEFF POSNICK: Maybe create an
[INAUDIBLE] that's like really

577
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,380
good just to let people know
that this is really good.

578
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,190
And best like &mdash;

579
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,690
JOHN LUTHER: Best is &mdash;

580
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,590
JEFF POSNICK: --a little insane,
a little too much.

581
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,750
JOHN LUTHER: It should
be, like, wait a long

582
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,350
time, not so long.

583
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,620
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

584
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,170
JOHN LUTHER: But for most use
cases, especially for web

585
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:32,810
video, the good setting is
usually where you want to be.

586
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,590
You can control in the encoder
how much CPU the encode takes.

587
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,030
You can set a lower priority
if you want.

588
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,510
It'll take longer, but if you
want to then be doing other

589
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,580
stuff on that machine &mdash;

590
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,350
JEFF POSNICK: For instance, if
you are including this as part

591
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,660
of a game or some sort of
application where you're

592
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,380
capturing video and
then encoding it.

593
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,130
That [INAUDIBLE].

594
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,770
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah, that's
a perfect example.

595
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,430
In gameplay you would want to be
setting this to real-time.

596
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,380
Because whether you're writing
it to disc or sending it up to

597
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,250
YouTube of some more of a stream
you want to be doing

598
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,240
that encoding in real-time.

599
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,000
And VP8's a very good
real-time &mdash;

600
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,130
JEFF POSNICK: I was actually a
little confused when we were

601
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,320
talking before and you were
saying real-time.

602
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,790
So real-time does not mean
you're going to get the

603
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,070
encoding done as quick
as possible.

604
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,460
Sorry, it does mean that it's
going to be as quick as

605
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,760
possible, but it's not
necessarily as high a quality

606
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,610
as you might get with the best
setting or even the good.

607
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,160
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah, right.

608
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,150
It's not &mdash;

609
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,380
JEFF POSNICK: It's for scenarios
where getting the

610
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,670
real-time transcoding done is
the most important thing.

611
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,410
JOHN LUTHER: Yes.

612
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,780
And that's why it's
called real-time,

613
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,820
it's not called live.

614
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,570
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

615
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:31,995
JOHN LUTHER: That's the
other distinction.

616
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:33,220
A lot of people say, well,
that's the live mode.

617
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,340
Well, it's not really.

618
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,080
That's the one that will be
encoding stuff in real-time

619
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,840
even if you're writing it
to a disk for later.

620
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,370
But if you want to be encoding
stuff as it's happening

621
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,090
without having like a gigantic
buffer of gameplay that you

622
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,260
then have to do &mdash;

623
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,200
JEFF POSNICK: Ok, great.

624
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,560
JOHN LUTHER: So, yeah.

625
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,736
That's pretty much the
use case for it.

626
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:50,590
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

627
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,480
JOHN LUTHER: So then this
command just scales.

628
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,300
There are some settings here
for setting the bit rate.

629
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,910
And then this bit rate
threshold here, BT.

630
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,880
This is essentially saying
because this is a variable,

631
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,270
bit rate and code, that
easier sections of &mdash;

632
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,710
if there's a lot of static areas
in the video, you don't

633
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,870
want to encode those again,
it's redundant.

634
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,625
You just carry them over
from frame to frame.

635
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,660
But in other harder sections
you want to throw

636
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,490
more bits at those.

637
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,280
This just says, OK, I don't want
you to ever go over twice

638
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,730
the target bit rate because you
don't want gigantic spikes

639
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,770
in the VBR.

640
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,180
JEFF POSNICK: Gotchya.

641
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,330
JOHN LUTHER: That's really
all that is.

642
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:27,460
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

643
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,540
JOHN LUTHER: And it's
going to scale it.

644
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,880
I'm going to dedicate
four threads to

645
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,800
this, processor cores.

646
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,660
And we're going to do
this in two passes.

647
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,840
First pass.

648
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,070
And then this one below is
pretty much the same stuff.

649
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,680
I don't actually need
all these up front.

650
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,500
So the second pass is the
one that's actually

651
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:44,990
going to do the work.

652
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,550
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

653
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,900
JOHN LUTHER: First pass really
runs through very fast.

654
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,650
It says, OK, get a handle on
what's going on here and

655
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,960
gather some statistics and look
for where there might be

656
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,790
redundancies just to get
a kind of overview.

657
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,250
And then the second pass is
where the actual real encoding

658
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,730
and compression is
going to happen.

659
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,390
JEFF POSNICK: Oh, that's
interesting.

660
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,305
I didn't realize
that that was &mdash;

661
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:06,430
You have two sets of double
ampersands there.

662
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,130
I don't know if that's going
to mess up your &mdash;

663
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,930
JOHN LUTHER: Oh, thank you.

664
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,580
Good eye, good eye.

665
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:09,680
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

666
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:17,020
JOHN LUTHER: All right, so for
the SD case we'll just paste

667
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,330
that in there.

668
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,780
And this maybe to some people
looks very scary.

669
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,160
What is going on here, all
this command line stuff?

670
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,270
This FFmpeg instance &mdash;

671
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,000
this is a Mac.

672
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,300
I installed this from MacPorts
in five minutes.

673
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,040
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

674
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,340
JOHN LUTHER: Sudo port install,
FFmpeg, and VP8'Ss in

675
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,310
there, WebM muxer's in there.

676
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,530
All that stuff just comes right
down, same for Linux.

677
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,040
Windows, a little
bit trickier.

678
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,120
I don't have as much experience

679
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,370
doing FFmpeg on Windows.

680
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,880
But for Mac and Linux
it's just a snap.

681
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,290
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

682
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,870
And, again, this use case is for
people that maybe want to

683
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,550
run their own encoding from
the command line.

684
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,370
But if you're writing an
application there are bindings

685
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,870
and [INAUDIBLE]

686
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,320
say things that you don't use.

687
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,430
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah, FFmpeg &mdash;

688
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,730
I mean, you could
do that with it.

689
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,640
It's more of a &mdash;

690
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,195
if you can run it on a server
from the command line, you

691
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:13,990
could batch these things.

692
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,930
But, yeah, you're right.

693
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,400
If you were developing more of
a lower level application you

694
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,530
might want to just take libvpx
library, the libvorbis

695
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,710
library, and then we have
another library for

696
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,560
the muxer, the WebM.

697
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,470
In some cases people aren't
muxing them, they're actually

698
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,800
keeping the stream separate.

699
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,510
JEFF POSNICK: Interesting.

700
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,590
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah, that's
another whole other

701
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,270
discussion.

702
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,701
So that's done.

703
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:36,300
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

704
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:42,920
JOHN LUTHER: And you can see
here, right here, this is just

705
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,995
a test video that was created.

706
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:48,125
The guys at Elemental, there
were a lot of these MPEG test

707
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,880
clips they recreated
them at 4K.

708
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,590
So that's it.

709
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,710
JEFF POSNICK: There you go.

710
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,630
I mean, it's a little
unfortunate that the end

711
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,200
result here is just &mdash;

712
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,160
it's like when you
see a TV screen &mdash;

713
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,440
JOHN LUTHER: Right.

714
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,670
JEFF POSNICK: --and the
commercial on TV it's like,

715
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,320
OK, well this doesn't really
tell you what the actual video

716
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,425
quality is as I'm watching
it on my TV.

717
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:11,210
So you're watching that as
part of a video stream.

718
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,791
JOHN LUTHER: It's hard
especially when I go to a lot

719
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:16,160
of shows and do give
presentations and it's on a

720
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
gigantic projector.

721
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,100
Yeah, people are like
OK, whatever.

722
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,570
And it's also like,
look it's done.

723
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,510
It's like, well, yeah
it made a video.

724
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:24,610
OK.

725
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,910
JEFF POSNICK: Yes.

726
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,640
But try it out yourself
I guess.

727
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,190
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah, definitely
try it yourself.

728
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,326
Write to me or to us.

729
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:34,010
I can give you my settings.

730
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,390
There are some WebM
presets in FFmpeg.

731
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,950
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

732
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,870
JOHN LUTHER: We don't have time
to go through that, but

733
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,750
that's also easy to do.

734
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:46,720
But I'm very lucky to do what
I do, because I get to mess

735
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,060
around with this stuff.

736
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,230
Who wouldn't want to watch
TV for a living?

737
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,885
Well, maybe I don't watch TV.

738
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:54,100
But to get to watch &mdash;

739
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,670
JEFF POSNICK: I watch video.

740
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,640
I always have an excuse to
watch YouTube videos.

741
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,220
JOHN LUTHER: That's true.

742
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,440
I'm testing.

743
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,610
JEFF POSNICK: I know exactly
how you feel.

744
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,570
I'm debugging.

745
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,090
JOHN LUTHER: Exactly.

746
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,660
JEFF POSNICK: Exactly.

747
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,640
So OK, cool.

748
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,450
So that's another use case
we've gone through.

749
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,600
Let's it say a completely
different use case.

750
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,050
I'm like a hardware
entertainment device

751
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,240
manufacturer and I want to make
sure my device has good

752
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,270
support for WebM, presumably
decoding, maybe encoding.

753
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,750
What are some resources
that are available?

754
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,490
JOHN LUTHER: Sure.

755
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,380
In most cases for something like
a consumer electronics,

756
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,160
that would be primarily a
decoding use case though, we

757
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,900
do have WebBPX ported to ARM.

758
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,250
So there's the software.

759
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,990
Like I said, it's an Android.

760
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,070
There's also now what I was
mentioning earlier about these

761
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,940
things taking time.

762
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,590
And we're just sort of coming
over the crest of this, but

763
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:48,010
we're now getting to, and we
worked really hard on this, is

764
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,240
having a lot of hardware
companies, people who make the

765
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,050
actual chips that go into
devices, put VP8 decoding on

766
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,370
those chips in hardware.

767
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,020
JEFF POSNICK: Great.

768
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:02,160
JOHN LUTHER: Having that stuff
burned in silicon is much more

769
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,670
efficient then software
just because

770
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,965
there's not as much overhead.

771
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:08,200
It uses far less battery
power for devices.

772
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,620
So it's cool.

773
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,130
I mean, we're now seeing VP8
silicon coming from Samsung,

774
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,170
Qualcomm, Broadcom.

775
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:19,940
A lot of these major
semiconductor makers are

776
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,580
rolling this stuff out.

777
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,210
We also as part of our project
have an actual hardware team

778
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,930
and their job is to design
these codecs in a sort of

779
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,020
middle tier language.

780
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,810
Verilog, RTL, these are very &mdash;

781
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,990
these are not the kind of things
you guys I hope maybe

782
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,970
don't have to deal with.

783
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:40,720
But these guys &mdash;

784
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,250
JEFF POSNICK: Right, join
us next week for Verilog

785
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,030
developer's log live.

786
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,690
JOHN LUTHER: For a Verilog &mdash;

787
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,440
it's kind of cool.

788
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,353
These guys are way
up in Finland,

789
00:30:47,353 --> 00:30:49,240
like in northern Finland.

790
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,690
And they're like little wizards
up there doing all

791
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,530
this magic stuff.

792
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,315
I have no idea how it works.

793
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:55,640
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

794
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,110
I think for software people,
the folks who deal with

795
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,680
hardware it's always just &mdash;

796
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,610
JOHN LUTHER: It's a
whole other world.

797
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,800
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, you're
kind of blown away.

798
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,210
JOHN LUTHER: So if you are
somebody who said, well, I've

799
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,110
looked at the offerings &mdash;

800
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:11,950
and on our site there's a page
where we list all the &mdash;

801
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,910
JEFF POSNICK: [INAUDIBLE]

802
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,790
bring that up.

803
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,130
JOHN LUTHER: We can give
that link later.

804
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,190
I don't right away have it.

805
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,940
JEFF POSNICK: And it's
at webmproject.org.

806
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,613
JOHN LUTHER: Yeah,
webmproject.org.

807
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,640
That's it right here
under hardware.

808
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,160
Also there's a Wiki page that
lists like all the chips now

809
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,230
that are shipping with VP8
in them and so forth.

810
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,950
So anyway, these guys take these
designs and if you were

811
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,350
somebody who wanted to make your
own chip with VP8 in it,

812
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,570
encoding or decoding, we would
license those designs to you.

813
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,600
And then you could go to an
ASIC manufacturer and make

814
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,180
your own chip.

815
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,160
And a lot of people have
done that and they're

816
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,890
listed on the site.

817
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,360
Some of the companies have
written their own

818
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,270
implementations, which, again,
that's fine with us.

819
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:54,420
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

820
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,350
JOHN LUTHER: It's what the
license is all about.

821
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,010
So, yeah, if device people &mdash;

822
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,910
there's a whole ecosystem
for that that's

823
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,360
finally growing up.

824
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,660
And this is what we knew would
take time and we're happy that

825
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,080
it's all starting to
come together.

826
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,940
JEFF POSNICK: OK, awesome.

827
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,170
So I definitely do not want
you to reveal anything

828
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,420
confidential or anything you
should not be talking about,

829
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,520
but what kind of things are
you working on now in the

830
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,020
whole codec space?

831
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,980
What are some things that might
be in the pipeline that

832
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,960
we should look forward to?

833
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,330
JOHN LUTHER: Well, one of the
things that is different now

834
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,680
is when we were On2 we were a
proprietary company, we did

835
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,270
this stuff to sell.

836
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,190
Now, it's an open project,
everything we

837
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,940
do is in the open.

838
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,770
So VP9, which we've been working
on for a while and is

839
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,950
starting to come together and
we're seeing some pretty

840
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,690
amazing results.

841
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,190
That's all been done
in the open.

842
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,900
JEFF POSNICK: OK.

843
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,150
JOHN LUTHER: I mean, in this
experimental branch that I

844
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:01,010
have talked about is where
starting from VP8 &mdash;

845
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,270
and now we have more resources
with Google, more engineers to

846
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,100
put on this stuff.

847
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,930
They've put some pretty amazing
stuff into VP9.

848
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,530
I don't know how much people
want to know about things like

849
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:17,800
superblocks and macroblocks and
vector prediction and all

850
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,000
this kind of &mdash; there's a
lot of very cool stuff.

851
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,340
JEFF POSNICK: Well, I'm
personally interested and I

852
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,360
happen to be here with
you right now.

853
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,900
So &mdash;

854
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,400
JOHN LUTHER: OK.

855
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,600
JEFF POSNICK: ---whatever
they [INAUDIBLE].

856
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,380
JOHN LUTHER: You guys just
hit mute for a minute.

857
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,640
JEFF POSNICK: No, so I guess
I'm always curious, like,

858
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,860
where are the areas that
we can still improve?

859
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,270
At this point after spending
decades, I know there are

860
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,410
people who've spent decades
looking at these thing, what

861
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,390
areas are right for
breakthroughs?

862
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,900
Is it just a question of like
throwing more hardware speed

863
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,010
at things and be able to do
things you couldn't do before,

864
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,210
or other algorithms?

865
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,440
JOHN LUTHER: More hardware
never hurts.

866
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,560
But having been in this while &mdash;
and you do hear it

867
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,030
from people, well, at this
point it's all just

868
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,420
incremental improvements.

869
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,940

870
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,520
Again, our kind of charter is to
sort of reject that kind of

871
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:09,330
thinking and do whatever,
wild stuff.

872
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:09,670
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

873
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,530
JOHN LUTHER: There's a lot of
things that we want to do in

874
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,810
the future that do get away
from the more traditional

875
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,244
what's called a DCT-based
codec, you

876
00:34:18,244 --> 00:34:19,275
know, discrete cosine.

877
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:22,570
That's sort of the core
of how it's done.

878
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,060
You know, we kind of challenge
ourselves to do the big

879
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,659
thinking about that stuff and
not just a couple percent

880
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,040
here, a couple percent there.

881
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,060
In VP9 we're seeing huge, huge
improvements over VP8.

882
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,960
I mean, it's a gigantic leap
forward in terms of the

883
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,290
efficiency of the codec and what
it's capable of doing.

884
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,800
And a lot of that has been
just hard research &mdash;

885
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,120
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

886
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,699
JOHN LUTHER: --and a lot of
very smart people, not me,

887
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,050
people a lot smarter than me
working on the code and the

888
00:34:59,050 --> 00:34:59,670
algorithms.

889
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,001
JEFF POSNICK: OK, fair enough.

890
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:02,490
Cool.

891
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,710
All right, thank you.

892
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,260
So I'm just checking out real
quick the Google Moderator

893
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,050
link that we have set up.

894
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,680
Unfortunately we do not have any
questions right now from

895
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,060
the external audience.

896
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,160
JOHN LUTHER: Oh, come
on, you guys.

897
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,140
JEFF POSNICK: So hopefully I was
able to ask on everyone's

898
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,230
behalf all the questions that
people wanted to know.

899
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,670
JOHN LUTHER: And if there's
something they want to ask,

900
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,330
johnluther@webmproject.org or
jluther@google.com, either one

901
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,200
will get to me.

902
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,600
JEFF POSNICK: That's great.

903
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
JOHN LUTHER: We also
have WebM-discuss.

904
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,580
There's a list of the mailing
lists on our site

905
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,150
where people can &mdash;

906
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,405
there's one for apps, one
for codec development.

907
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:33,750
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

908
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,630
JOHN LUTHER: You can ask
questions there.

909
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,390
We're always looking for
contributions to the project,

910
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,270
code, documentation, whatever.

911
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,830
Advocacy, anything people want
to do, everybody's welcome.

912
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,120
JEFF POSNICK: Great.

913
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,400
Good to know.

914
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,630
All right.

915
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,520
So I think that is about it for
our interview with John.

916
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,950
I'm going put a quick plug at
the end of the show as we do

917
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,540
on every show that Google's
Developer Relations team is

918
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,880
hiring and
developers.google.com/jobs is

919
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,590
the place to go, if you are
interested in doing what I do

920
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,465
such as interviewing &mdash;

921
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:06,890
JOHN LUTHER: I would
want to do that.

922
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,840
JEFF POSNICK: --cool people on
top of all the other stuff

923
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,290
that Developer Relations does.

924
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,130
So check that out if
you're interested.

925
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,740
And I just really want to thank
John again, it's been an

926
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,150
awesome show.

927
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,240
JOHN LUTHER: Thank you.

928
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,190
No, I appreciate
the invitation.

929
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,410
It was great.

930
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,245
JEFF POSNICK: Very cool.

931
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:20,620
OK.

932
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,150
JOHN LUTHER: Thanks everybody.

933
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,400
JEFF POSNICK: Bye everybody.

934
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:30,733
