1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,295

2
00:00:00,295 --> 00:00:00,950
SEAN MADAY: All right.

3
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,820
Good afternoon, everybody.

4
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,140
Thanks for taking the
time to join us.

5
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,060
My name is Sean Maday.

6
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,305
I'm a product manager on the
Maps for Business team.

7
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:08,560
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
And I'm Avnish.

8
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,310
I'm a technical solutions
engineer in

9
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,692
the Enterprise team.

10
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:14,030
SEAN MADAY: Our goal today is
to talk to you a little bit

11
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,500
about a project that's near and
our heart, and that is the

12
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,790
ability to take the consumer
experience of Google Earth and

13
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,550
Google Maps, and take it
completely offline, behind the

14
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,480
firewall, or into kind
of bandwidth

15
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,470
disenfranchised areas.

16
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,760
We're going to throw a bunch of
nomenclature at you today.

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,960
And we're going to try to
paint a picture for you.

18
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,280
But it would be helpful for us
if we could just kind of do a

19
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,550
quick poll of the audience.

20
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,670
And I'm going to ask
a few questions.

21
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,890
How many of you have ever heard
of or used Google Earth

22
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,210
Enterprise?

23
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:41,460
Great.

24
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,020
OK.

25
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,900
For those joining us via video,
there's thousands of

26
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,710
people in attendance, and they
all raised their hand.

27
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,060
How about Portable?

28
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,420
How many of you have
ever used Portable?

29
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,960
The product we call Portable?

30
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,610
OK.

31
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,270
Great.

32
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,170
How about Google Maps Engine?

33
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,420
How many of you have
ever been hands on

34
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,685
with Google Maps Engine?

35
00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:57,120
Great.

36
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,360
OK.

37
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,070
That's very helpful.

38
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,660
Thank you.

39
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,920
As we go forward, for those of
you who weren't familiar with

40
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,870
any of those three products,
we'll make sure that we make

41
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,220
that clear to you.

42
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,090
Before we begin, I want to touch
on some current events.

43
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,210

44
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,830
You woke up this morning to
headlines that a series of

45
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,430
really severe tornadoes had
struck just southwest of the

46
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,680
Dallas-Fort Worth area.

47
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,620

48
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,310
A lot of times, we see this
type of headline.

49
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,330
But these headlines get kind
of lost in the news cycle.

50
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,490
But instrumental to the relief
and response effort in the

51
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,570
aftermath of a critical
incident, or a natural

52
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,660
disaster like this,
is usually a map.

53
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,980
And the context that that map
could provide to us as kind of

54
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,610
fellow Americans, or fellow
citizens of Earth, but also to

55
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,870
first responders and emergency
managers who are going to be

56
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,420
trying to restore and provide
relief for those affected.

57
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,345
So I just want to provide some
context with the map.

58
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:58,120
I'll show you here.

59
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,450
These are the four counties that
were primarily affected.

60
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,840
The green dots, or the green
placemarks you see here, were

61
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,960
kind of initial observations
that were recorded this

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,759
morning by several local
news affiliates.

63
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,930
And then the blue placemarks
you see here are actually

64
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,430
confirmed touchdowns that the
National Weather Service just

65
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,950
put out a few hours ago.

66
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,300
As we zoom in and we pan around
these affected areas,

67
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,510
the map is a really interesting
way for us to kind

68
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,980
of get some appreciation for
what this human terrain and

69
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,060
this natural landscape
looks like.

70
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,850
For those emergency managers
who are going to be

71
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,060
responsible for understanding
the scope and extent of this

72
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,840
devastation, and for those first
responders who are going

73
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,260
to be going door to door,
assessing damage and looking

74
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,520
for those who are injured or
afflicted, these sorts of maps

75
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,395
can be absolutely critical to
understanding and getting the

76
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:50,930
lay of the land.

77
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,340
So what we want to do today is
we want to illustrate to you

78
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,330
that these maps are obviously
very impactful and very useful

79
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,310
in an online setting, but they
can become even more useful.

80
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,310
They can become a
force multiplier

81
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,300
in an offline scenario.

82
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,720
Actually, the demo I'm
showing you here

83
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,840
is completely offline.

84
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,190
This is all running on my local
machine from the local

85
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,260
host URL you see at the
top of the screen.

86
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,530
All of these map tiles were cut
from Google Maps Engine.

87
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,710
These are Google Map tiles
down to level 17.

88
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,960
You get some very granular,
street level understanding.

89
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,640
But all of this is
coming offline.

90
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,810
So in the aftermath of these
critical incidents, when

91
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,740
there's limited or no
connectivity to the outside

92
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,470
world, that's really where this
story of offline begins.

93
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,920
As we take you through today,
that's going to kind of set

94
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,930
the expectation for what you
should see, and what we're

95
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,200
going to show you, and how you
can extend on these platforms.

96
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,090
You've heard some big numbers
over the last few days from

97
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,860
folks like Brian McClendon
and Manu Markes.

98
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,100
And they've talked to you about
the absolute ubiquity of

99
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,610
the Google Maps and Google
Earth platforms.

100
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,720
A billion users a week, a
million websites out there on

101
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,200
the open internet have
implemented the Maps API.

102
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,700
Google Maps has become the
platform whereby people go to

103
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,475
make fast, informed decisions
about geography.

104
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:06,190
Right?

105
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,350
So asset tracking, looking for
information about where to

106
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,140
live, where to shop,
what to buy.

107
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,480
Google Earth becomes the
substrate, or the backdrop, by

108
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,560
which these sorts of
engagements occur.

109
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,750
The focus of our team, and then
the focus of the product

110
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,540
we're going to show you today,
is really on how to extend

111
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,130
this functionality into
situations and scenarios where

112
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,250
that connectivity to the outside
world is unavailable

113
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,780
or is significantly degraded.

114
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,910
We talked to the emergency
management, or emergency

115
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,190
response type scenario, but
there are many other scenarios

116
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,460
that play a role here.

117
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,400
Paramount among them, things
like research and outreach.

118
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,750
Things that take researchers
and scientists to far off

119
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,240
areas of the globe where they
just don't have connectivity

120
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,550
to the rest of the world.

121
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,690
Then there's certainly lots of
interesting defense and public

122
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,130
safety applications for this
sort of technology.

123
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,900
So with that, let's dive
and talk a little

124
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,760
bit more about Portable.

125
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,090
Google Maps Engine Portable, or
Portable, as we call it, is

126
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,060
the product that takes the
familiarity of Google Earth

127
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,360
and Google Maps offline behind
the firewall, deploys it on

128
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,520
your own network, on your
own local device.

129
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,080
We have builds of Portable for
Mac, Windows, and laptop.

130
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,390
And to be totally
transparent &mdash;

131
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,060
I want to be very clear &mdash; this
is an enterprise track.

132
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,660
These are generally
paid products.

133
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,830
Although we have a very
robust outreach, and

134
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,260
develop for good effort.

135
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,800
If you work with an NGO, or
you work in the nonprofit

136
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,650
space, we would love to get you
a grant for this sort of

137
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,620
functionality so that you can
empower your constituents with

138
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,580
this technology.

139
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,730
We're also excited to foreshadow
some releases in

140
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,940
the months ahead, where we will
take this capability to

141
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,235
Android tablets and
smartphones.

142
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:51,360

143
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,830
Portable, as it exists today,
is a laptop application,

144
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,610
desktop application,
which builds for

145
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,560
Mac, Linux, and Windows.

146
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,350
It scales from one to 10 users,
so you could either run

147
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,190
the scenario locally on your
individual machine, or sit in

148
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,030
a small tactical operations,
or team type environment,

149
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,670
where you could share
that experience

150
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,940
across up to 10 devices.

151
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,270
And at its essence, behind
Portable is really just a

152
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,980
lightweight, Tornado
web server.

153
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,880
For those of you who aren't
familiar with Tornado, it's an

154
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,160
open sourced, kind of massively
scalable web serving

155
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,080
application.

156
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,750
Very powerful, and it provides
the foundation by which we

157
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,000
deliver the Portable
functionality.

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,610

159
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,810
As we step deeper into this
Portable ecosystem, Portable

160
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,150
is the client software that will
serve up a Maps on Earth

161
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,910
experience.

162
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,590
But what it serves is a portable
cache, or as we may

163
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,040
refer to it, a cut.

164
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,020
A map or a globe that has been
packaged and prepared for

165
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,290
offline use.

166
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,590
There's a couple ways
right now to build

167
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,930
one of these cuts.

168
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,410
The first is with Google
Earth Enterprise.

169
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,200
For those of you who've used
Google Earth Enterprise, or

170
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,390
have access to Google Earth
Enterprise, you have the

171
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,790
ability to extract a portion,
or even the entirety of your

172
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,990
Google Earth Enterprise Maps on
Earth experience into this

173
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,490
file format so that
you can use it in

174
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,100
these offline settings.

175
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,190
We're also really excited to
bring online in the next

176
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,660
couple months the capability to
cut this rich map data out

177
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,520
of the Google Maps
Engine enclave.

178
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,600
All of you, I'm sure, have
heard, but we would love to

179
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,540
get to Google Maps Engine
into your hands.

180
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,080
If you come visit us at the
Sandbox, come visit us at the

181
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,000
booth, we'll give you
information so that you can

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,260
start a free trial of the Google
Maps Engine platform.

183
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,740
It's a very exciting way to take
lots of imagery, terrain,

184
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,920
and vector data, process it in
the cloud, and then very soon,

185
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,880
you'll be able to pull out
these maps and earth

186
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,130
experiences for completely
offline use.

187
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,335
The output of either of these
two processes is a .GLC file.

188
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:44,640
Right?

189
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,460
This is your portable cut.

190
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,660
With that cut, you could do
some interesting things.

191
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,950
But let's first dive into
what that cut is.

192
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,590
That cut, as we call it,
is really just a

193
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,656
single binary file.

194
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:56,830
It can be very large.

195
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,660
It can be very small.

196
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,260
It's really restricted only by
the file size limitations of

197
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,250
your file system.

198
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,830
It carries the .GLC extension.

199
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,160
In the past, if you have used
Google Earth Enterprise, you

200
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,510
may have seen a .GLM
or .GLB file.

201
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,900
.GLC is the new, kind of
standard wrapper that will

202
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,440
encompass all of these Portable
caches going forward.

203
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,130
We also have the ability to
include into this binary file

204
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,390
a custom point of interest
search, so that it your users,

205
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,950
or your constituents, your
stakeholders, need to search

206
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,130
against this rich corpus of
data you're giving them

207
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,360
offline, we want to give you
the ability to define the

208
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,600
points that they can
search against.

209
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,240
So now that we have this cut
that we've taken from Google

210
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,760
Earth Enterprise or Google Maps
Engine, we can drop it

211
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,669
seamlessly into the
Portable server.

212
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,780
And once it's on the Portable
server, we have some really

213
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,080
interesting ways to interact and
extend this functionality.

214
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,530
Avnish is going to dig into
this a little deeper.

215
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,360
But at a high level, you can
think of this as the Earth API

216
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,170
and the Maps API you're
familiar with from the

217
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,950
consumer internet, packaged
and deployed in a slightly

218
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,150
modified data on your
local device.

219
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,000
You can also interact with these
caches via the Google

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,630
Earth Enterprise client, that
is to say our version of

221
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,090
Google Earth Pro that isn't
hardwired to Google servers.

222
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,640
We'll show you some examples
of that when we

223
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,600
jump into the demos.

224
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,100
Then of course, we have some
interesting and evolving ways

225
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,040
for you to interact with this
Portable Map or Earth

226
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,050
experience using Android
devices.

227
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,090
So with that, let's talk through
how we create one of

228
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,180
these Portable maps or globes.

229
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,070
The basic building block of
cutting a Portable is really

230
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,740
to define your area
of interest.

231
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,070
And that's done with
the KML polygon.

232
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,600
It can be as simple
or as complex a

233
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,470
polygon as you see fit.

234
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,230
It can be a single polygon, or
it could be a multi-polygon,

235
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,800
depending on your use cases.

236
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,210
It is specified simply
with KML.

237
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,020
Once you have specified your
KML, you'll make some

238
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,190
decisions about how deep
into the cuts.

239
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,220
And when I say deep, I'm talking
about how many zoom

240
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,480
levels deep into the cut you
will want to extract that

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,030
data, and then how far outside
the cut you're going to want

242
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,820
to extract that data.

243
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,650
For those of you who aren't
familiar with zoom levels,

244
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,520
it's the way that we take a lot
of map data and make it

245
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,770
discoverable at different zoom
levels with varying degrees of

246
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:13,650
resolution and numbers of tiles,
based on how far in or

247
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,020
out you have zoomed
and panned.

248
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,260

249
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,430
Today, for those of you using
Google Earth Enterprise or who

250
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,410
have access to a Google Earth
Enterprise system, you have a

251
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,300
couple different ways to kick
off one of these cuts.

252
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,830
The first is with a simple
HTML5 interface.

253
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,850
That is something I'll
show you right now.

254
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,350

255
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,800
This is the cutting interface
that will be released with

256
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,550
Google Earth Enterprise 4.5 in
just another couple weeks.

257
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,610
Here, I'm looking at a
two dimensional map.

258
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,970
This map has fairly low
resolution satellite imagery

259
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,430
for the entire world.

260
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,870
Four kilometer satellite
imagery.

261
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,080
So fairly low resolution.

262
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,790
But as I zoom and pan, you'll
notice the map is truly a

263
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,360
Google map.

264
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,020
This looks, and feels, and
interacts like a Google map.

265
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,190
From the cutter here, I have the
ability to define an area

266
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,120
of interest.

267
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,260
So let's say I want to take kind
of the Western seaboard

268
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,680
of the United States, just shy
of the Washington border.

269
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,210
And once I've defined my polygon
here, I can also kind

270
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,960
of redefine the points
of interest.

271
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,480
From there, I'll have the
ability to state a name.

272
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,650
So maybe I want to call this
my West Coast Globe.

273
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,220
I can throw in a description.

274
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,760
As you can imagine, over time,
you can generate a lot of

275
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,875
these cuts on your
local machine.

276
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,415
You can generate a lot
of these cuts that go

277
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:30,170
out into the field.

278
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,250
So you're going to want to be as
descriptive as possible to

279
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,580
make sure that you capture what
is inside of this cut.

280
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,860
Certainly here, we'll just
make an example.

281
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,360
But you can be as verbose
as you would like.

282
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,270
Using these pull-down menus,
we'll decide again how deep we

283
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,510
want to cut inside the polygon,
and how deep we want

284
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,880
to cut outside the polygon.

285
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,990
So here, I'm simply going
to make some arbitrary

286
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,920
selections.

287
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,490
We'll say zoom level four
for the entire world.

288
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,340
That's a very low resolution.

289
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,820
The entire world represented on
a very few number of tiles.

290
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,270
And we'll cut to level 18
inside the polygon.

291
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,810
That is a large number of tiles,
down to generally about

292
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,380
one meter resolution, if we
were talking in imagery.

293
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,630
And then we can kick
off that cut.

294
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,680
It's an asynchronous process.

295
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,750
It kind of happens here
in the browser window.

296
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,650
Lots of dialogue coming
back to tell us how

297
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,050
big that cut is getting.

298
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,060
And this was a fairly small
cut, because I had low

299
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,370
resolution imagery.

300
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,090
So it's indicated that
the cut is complete.

301
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,750
In addition to that user
interface, The HTML5 user

302
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,160
interface that we package with
Google Earth Enterprise, we

303
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,680
also have command line utilities
that would allow you

304
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,960
to script this workflow.

305
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,870
We'll dig a little deeper into
that in a couple slides.

306
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,760
But some really exciting ways
there to kick off cuts

307
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,560
programmatically.

308
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,910
And the neat thing here &mdash;

309
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,320
and this is kind of a departure
from the capability

310
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,710
we've been able to offer with
the online version of Google

311
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,690
Earth or Google Earth
Enterprise &mdash;

312
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,750
we have the ability with
Portable to let you offer your

313
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,980
users and your viewers up to
five layers of imagery.

314
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,750
So I'd like to show
you that now.

315
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,710
Here I'm logged into the Google

316
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,900
Earth Enterprise client.

317
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,460
I'm going to zip back to
Portable, and I'm going to

318
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,970
change the Portable map that
I'm currently serving.

319
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,290
So this is the Portable
interface as it exists.

320
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,770
As I mentioned to you, HTML5
interface, it looks about the

321
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,590
same on Mac, Windows,
or Linux.

322
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,220
Here, I'm going to say that
I want to serve up my

323
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,990
Las Vegas 3D globe.

324
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,030
Now that that's serving, I can
jump back to the Earth

325
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,970
Enterprise client.

326
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,840
And in addition to being logged
into Google's globe,

327
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,800
which isn't necessary, but just
happens to be what I have

328
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,350
here, I'm going to log in to
my local host address.

329
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,440
You'll notice in the lower left
hand corner, I've now

330
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,170
added a second database
that I can explore.

331
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,550
And as we zoom in, I can
actually turn off all the

332
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,980
imagery, terrain, and vector
data associated

333
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,710
with Google's globe.

334
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,540
So we just see this small patch
of alpha massed imagery

335
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,510
that we cut over the
Las Vegas strip.

336
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,940
Now you'll notice in the lower
left hand corner, we have five

337
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,580
different imagery layers
that represent

338
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,320
this particular scene.

339
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,350
So as a user now, I can come
back and forth, and look at

340
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,290
these individual dates.

341
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,810
I can see what this scene
looked like in 2010.

342
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,930
I can see what it looked
like in 2003.

343
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,510
We've had this ability to
support historic imagery in

344
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,970
Google Earth for a long time.

345
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,380
But Portable gives you the
flexibility to actually use

346
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,190
the transparency slider to step
back and forth between

347
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,510
these individual scenes.

348
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,740
So we can really look at how
this landscape has changed

349
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,610
between any of the five imagery
layers that are

350
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,720
denoted in lower left
hand corner of our

351
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,410
Google Earth display.

352
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,910
Very cool way to kind
of understand

353
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,160
that change over time.

354
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,570

355
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,960
We're really excited, and we
have a really strong team of

356
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,280
engineers working hard on the
ability to allow cutting of

357
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,930
portables from Google
Maps Engine.

358
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,480
So this is coming soon, a little
bit later in 2013.

359
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,090
But in the Google Maps Engine
interface, we'll have a

360
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,260
browser-based capability for
you to define the polygon,

361
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,730
your point of interest, choose
the layers you want to cut,

362
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,450
and kick off an asynchronous
cut.

363
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,230
Take large amounts of map data,
combine them into a

364
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,360
single binary file that you can
pull from the cloud, and

365
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,560
serve locally on
your machines.

366
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
This is working today.

367
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,870
Actually, some of the demos I'm
showing you here, like the

368
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,300
Texas demo, was actually cut
from Google Maps Engine.

369
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,830
Again, we're just kind of
working on making this

370
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,040
capability more robust.

371
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,730
We're really excited to get
it in the hands of trusted

372
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,500
testers in the next
couple months.

373
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,280
In addition to what we're
offering inside of the HTML5

374
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,200
interface, we also are going to
allow programmatic access.

375
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,510
Again, you could kick off these
cuts programmatically.

376
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,470
Our vision going forward is
really to offer some composite

377
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,000
solutions that allow you to
leverage both the cloud,

378
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,520
you're on-premise geospatial
investments, and new emerging

379
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,010
form factors for devices to
create familiar Google Earth

380
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,570
and Google Maps experiences that
your users can interact

381
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,940
with completely offline.

382
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Whether those tiles come from
Google Earth Enterprise,

383
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,950
Google Maps Engine, maybe even
cutting Google basemap tiles,

384
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,160
as we mature that capability,
you should be able to

385
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,960
consolidate these individual
cuts, and create the custom

386
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,390
map environment that your
users need, but with the

387
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,130
familiarity that Google Earth
and Google Maps has instilled

388
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,380
in these consumers.

389
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,800

390
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,840
Right in line with this
is this ability to cut

391
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,490
programmatically.

392
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,940
What I really like about this
is we hearken back to that

393
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,500
disaster response scenario.

394
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,130
This gives us some really
exciting ways to proactively

395
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,500
respond to natural disasters
and critical incidents.

396
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,890
What do I mean by that.?

397
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,740
Well, the National Weather
Service puts out the map you

398
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,570
see in the upper left
hand corner.

399
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,500
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
they're monitoring all

400
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,220
3,141 different counties
in the United States.

401
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,820
And they're monitoring the
weather patterns that are

402
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,920
affecting the people inside
of those counties.

403
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,310
They're putting out this
large, common, alerting

404
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,560
protocol, XML, or CAP, as
they kind of call it.

405
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,140
At every given moment, this
thing is updated.

406
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,760
It shows which counties are
under a flood advisory, which

407
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,370
counties are under a severe
winter weather advisory, which

408
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,350
counties are under a
tornado warning.

409
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,880
With this sort of rich data, and
the programmatic access to

410
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,820
cutting that is currently
available today in Google

411
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,910
Earth Enterprise and quickly
becoming available in Google

412
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,350
Maps Engine, we can start
to script some

413
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,880
really interesting solutions.

414
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,960
So for instance, the Texas demo
I showed you earlier,

415
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,290
simply scrape through this XML,
look for counties that

416
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,470
had progressed from a tornado
watch to a tornado warning.

417
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,700
It then combined the geographic
bounds for those

418
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,520
counties into a single polygon,
passed that polygon

419
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,540
into the Google Maps Engine
cutter, and allowed us to kick

420
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,140
off that cut programmatically
the minute those

421
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,500
warnings were issued.

422
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,150
So to follow that chain of kind
of thinking, that would

423
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,410
allow your organization, or
first responders anywhere, to

424
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,119
have access to this rich,
offline map data by the time

425
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,720
that they get the alert that
a storm is impending.

426
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,680

427
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,390
To do this, we'll just throw up
a couple code samples that

428
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,540
would let you kind
of dig into this.

429
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,770
But it's as simple as just using
some Python to reach

430
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,940
out, grab that XML from the
National Weather Service, read

431
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,880
it into your local system, parse
through it, and then as

432
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,850
you parse through it, look
for alerts that pass your

433
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,860
particular threshold.

434
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,690
Those warnings, those alerts,
tornadoes, floods, whatever

435
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,670
may fit your absolute
use case.

436
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,300
Another interesting
implementation of this is

437
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,070
something that our colleague,
Sean Wohltman, has put a lot

438
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,340
of passion behind for the last
few years, and that is making

439
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,650
this data available offline in
response to large hurricanes.

440
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,900
And so the National Weather
Service, in conjunction with

441
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,130
the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration,

442
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,620
puts out these cones of
uncertainty whenever a major

443
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,650
hurricane is bound for
the United States.

444
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,820
We can, again, follow the same
workflow to reach out, grab

445
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,620
that data, do something with
that polygon to convert it to

446
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,760
KML, so that we can use it
inside the Google Maps Engine

447
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,510
or Google Earth Enterprise
cutting infrastructure.

448
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,120
Here, this was as simple as
just a wget to grab it.

449
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,790
We needed to unzip the zip
file that the National

450
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,990
Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration and the

451
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,220
National Weather Service had put
out, and then just use an

452
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,870
open source vector processing
tool, like OGR, to convert it

453
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,960
from a shape file into a KML.

454
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,920
Once we have that KML,
we can feed it

455
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
into Google Maps Engine.

456
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,340
We can feed it into Google
Earth Enterprise.

457
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,510
And we can do that
programmatically to cut this

458
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,640
data, and make it available.

459
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,030
So now that we've set the
foundation for what Portable

460
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,110
is, and what it can do for you,
Avnish is going to talk

461
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,670
about how motivated and creative
developers like

462
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,060
yourself can extend this
functionality to do

463
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
interesting things in your

464
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,372
applications completely offline.

465
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:06,622
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
Thanks, Sean.

466
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:10,850

467
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,930
So Sean has nicely described the
workflow for cutting, and

468
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,930
creating, and serving your
portable globes.

469
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,050
So now, let's say you've done
all that, and now you have

470
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:26,380
this GLB, GLC file that's
sitting on your hard disk.

471
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,590
It could be tens of megabytes,
or several terabytes in size,

472
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,310
depending on your cut
that you made.

473
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,420
Now you're interested in serving
this out, and building

474
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,880
your applications
on top of it.

475
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,350
Now sure, you could launch the
Enterprise Client or the

476
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,620
Mobile Client that come out of
the box with these products,

477
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,000
and do your globe that way.

478
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,820
But where's the fun
in that, right?

479
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,740
You want to be able to build
your own custom applications

480
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,680
that are targeted for your
specific use case and

481
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,740
environment.

482
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,920
So how do you do that?

483
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,680
Well, the key is the Google
APIs that you

484
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,620
all know and love.

485
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,710
Namely the Google Maps API,
the Google Earth, the

486
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,960
JavaScript API.

487
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,310

488
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,360
Now conveniently, we offer
these with the product.

489
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,380
They come bundled with Google
Earth Enterprise server, as

490
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,110
well as the Portable server.

491
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,590
They are typically kept in &mdash;

492
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,630
they align in terms of the
version with the latest frozen

493
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,530
release that's out
on google.com.

494
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,220
Fundamentally, the version of
the API that comes with the

495
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,980
Portable server is the same as
what you find on google.com

496
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,040
with respect to the events, such
as the mouse over, click,

497
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,470
double click.

498
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,260
You have the same type
of controls.

499
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,940
Zoom, pan, scale, plus all
the custom controls.

500
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,370
You have overlays, such
as symbols, markers,

501
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,350
polylines, et cetera.

502
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:11,920
But there are some subtle
differences in the API that we

503
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,830
provide with the Portable server
compared to the one

504
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,080
that you load on google.com.

505
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,720
Some of those differences
include the way you actually

506
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,460
call and invoke those APIs.

507
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,670
Because obviously, you're
not going to be

508
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,060
getting them from Google.

509
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,950
You're going to be getting them
from the Portable server.

510
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,020
So they need to be loaded in
your web page from there.

511
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,980
And there's certain classes that
are offered to make it

512
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,430
easier to interact with the
2D and the 3D map tiles.

513
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,060
And I'm going to talk about
that in a moment.

514
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,980
And as you might also guess,
there's no support for certain

515
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,890
types of services, like the
Direction service, Panaramio,

516
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,330
Street View, et cetera, services
that require access

517
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,110
to Google's infrastructure.

518
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,160

519
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,390
So before we get into the sort
of nitty gritty, let me review

520
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:11,600
the workflow for hosting
a 2D map on Portable.

521
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,730
Typically, you're going to build
your 2D map either in

522
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,710
Google Earth Enterprise
Fusion, or, as Sean

523
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,540
demonstrated, in Google
Maps Engine.

524
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,340
You're going to choose the
layers of interest, your

525
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,400
imagery, your vector layers,
possibly some terrain.

526
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,980
At that point, you're going
to publish that 2D map.

527
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,970
In the case of GME, that's just
a matter of one click,

528
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,780
and making it available to
the folks that you share.

529
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,930
And in the case of Fusion, you
would typically publish it to

530
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,100
an Earth Enterprise server.

531
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:50,380
At that point, you're going
to cut a piece of that map

532
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,080
corresponding to the region of
interest, exactly the way Sean

533
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,370
demonstrated.

534
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,540
The output of that is going
to be that GLC file.

535
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,140
At that point, you're going to
start serving that GLC file to

536
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,590
the Portable server, and then
you can start building your

537
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,635
custom HTML applications that
load the JavaScript API.

538
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:12,910

539
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:18,440
What I'd like to do now, I have
here a little USB memory

540
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,770
stick that contains a GLC file
from a globe that I published

541
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,470
from Google Earth Enterprise.

542
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,030
It's a relatively small one.

543
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,360
A few hundred megabytes from a
sample, natural view globe

544
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,180
that I had created.

545
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,090
It's just got the base imagery
layer, and maybe one or two

546
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,340
vector layers.

547
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,120

548
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,990
According to the blue box, I had
built that globe of mine

549
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,180
in Fusion, and then I published
it to my Earth

550
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,360
Enterprise Server, the red box,
and then I cut it using

551
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,130
the Portable cutter UI.

552
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,560
So what I'm going to do
now is insert this

553
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:09,140
USB disk on my laptop.

554
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,780
And before doing that,
I'm going to go

555
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,960
completely off the grid.

556
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,345
Turn off Wi-Fi here.

557
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:21,140

558
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,290
It was like one of those corny
moments in a movie where they

559
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,640
use the title of the movie
in the actual dialogue.

560
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,750
I said off the grid.

561
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,000
I like it.

562
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,600

563
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,570
So I fire up my natural view,
US Portable globe, which

564
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,920
automatically by double clicking
it, kicks off the

565
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,660
Portable server that
I have running here

566
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,360
on my Windows laptop.

567
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,350
I click on View the
Map in a Browser.

568
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,980
It shows me a preview,
essentially,

569
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,820
of the globe I created.

570
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,480
Now, if you look at the URL
here, at this point, this map,

571
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,870
this globe is being served
from my Windows

572
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,280
machine on Port 9335.

573
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,470
So at this point, I can
start interacting

574
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,980
with this globe directly.

575
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,940
So I have a little Hello World
example that I'm going to go

576
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,145
over, that I'm going
to load here.

577
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:26,360

578
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,560
And let's take a look at the
source code for this.

579
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:38,680

580
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,600
These three lines here is where
I actually load the

581
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,710
Google Maps API that's on
my Portable server.

582
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:55,350
After the bootstrap loader,
the fusion_maps_v3 and the

583
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,380
other JavaScript helper file
essentially load the entire

584
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,710
Google Maps API into
this application.

585
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,140
So that's one of the
differences.

586
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,500
Then down here, you'll note
the use the class called

587
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,090
GFusionMap, which is &mdash;

588
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,220
you can think of it as
an extension of the

589
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,470
google.maps.mapclass.

590
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,800

591
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,750
And it's what you need to
instantiate in order to create

592
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,580
your 2D map in your HTML
container, which is typically

593
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,520
a development.

594
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,180
This class accepts the same
options as google.maps.map,

595
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,270
and can be used in
the same way.

596
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,386
And that's it.

597
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:46,020
That's all you need to do to
load 2D map in this simple

598
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,270
Hello World application.

599
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,310

600
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,050
Let's look at, maybe,
a few more examples.

601
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:59,570
I have one that loads some
symbols and polylines.

602
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:07,610

603
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:13,800
Now, here what I'm displaying is
certain markers that can be

604
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,400
used to decorate not
just points, but

605
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,470
polylines, as well.

606
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,790
It's making use of the
visualization features of the

607
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,350
Google Maps API.

608
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,770
But you'll note this math is
completely interactive.

609
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,640
In other words, I interact with
this map in the same way

610
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,120
that I would any Google map.

611
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,410
This was the area that I cut
in the San Francisco.

612
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,670
The area outside
of it is, well,

613
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,250
outside of my cut region.

614
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,180
But I can zoom in to the highest
resolution that was in

615
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,485
my original basemap.

616
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:53,710

617
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,180
And I can zoom, pan, scale,
all that good stuff.

618
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,080

619
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,335
Again, this is running
completely offline.

620
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:06,480
Let's have a look at
another example.

621
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,735
Perhaps a heat map.

622
00:28:07,735 --> 00:28:14,000

623
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,780
This is showing a time-based
based animation of the

624
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:24,810
expansion of Walmart stores
since the 1960s until now.

625
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,100
You can, again, use the
visualization capabilities in

626
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,770
the Google Maps API, varying
the intensity and the color

627
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,990
spectrum of the heat map.

628
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:39,690
And as before, I can interact
with this just as with any

629
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,400
other Google map.

630
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,230
I believe I have one other
example here to show

631
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,910
SEAN MADAY: These are the same
visualization demonstrations

632
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,980
and code examples you'll
find online using

633
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,250
public the Maps API.

634
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,530
The power here, of course, is
that it's all running off of

635
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,560
Avnish's local machine via
that local host URL.

636
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,810
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Right.

637
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,560

638
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,580
Again, this is another
time-based based animation

639
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,378
showing the expansion of
these Walmart stores.

640
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:11,310
SEAN MADAY: Our goal with these
demonstrations and code

641
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,750
samples is really to highlight
to you the

642
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,000
flexibility of this platform.

643
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,652

644
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:23,440
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: And this is
against my base map that I had

645
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,100
cut, and it's all being
served out of this USB

646
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,895
drive that I have here.

647
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,145
Let's go back.

648
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:41,020

649
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,250
I guess I got to get back
online to resume the

650
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,500
presentation.

651
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,150

652
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,290
SEAN MADAY: We can use mine.

653
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,180
Here you go.

654
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,190
I got mine on.

655
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,200
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: OK, thanks.

656
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,515
SEAN MADAY: Yep.

657
00:29:56,515 --> 00:29:59,065
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: So in that
Hello World example that I

658
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:02,140
just showed you, I've
highlighted the lines here

659
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,080
that would be needed to load
the JavaScript API off the

660
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,020
Portable server instead
of from google.com.

661
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,550
And again, you want to pay close
attention to the use of

662
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:20,044
this GFusionMap, which is what
you would need to instantiate.

663
00:30:20,044 --> 00:30:21,600
SEAN MADAY: All these
slides will be made

664
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,680
available after the talk.

665
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,140
So again, these code samples
aren't meant to be eye charts.

666
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,050
We want to leave these with you
as a resource that you can

667
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,760
reference later.

668
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,220
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Right.

669
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,140
And very analogous to the 2D
maps, we offer the 3D map API,

670
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,210
which is a Google Earth API.

671
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,620
It also is supported through
the use of the Google Earth

672
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,210
plug-in, which runs on
Windows and Mac.

673
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,320
And that API includes all the
capabilities that you're

674
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,460
probably familiar with from
placemarks, to balloons, and

675
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,890
historic imagery, et cetera.

676
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,100
In addition, it offers the
capability to connect to

677
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,530
multiple globes.

678
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:08,130
So this is a snippet of a Hello
World example for 3D.

679
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,530
Again, you're going to load the
JavaScript API from the

680
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,990
Portable server locally.

681
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,030
That's what the script
typeline is.

682
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,570
In the
google.earth.createinstance

683
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,800
call, there's a fourth
parameter, which is the URL of

684
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,140
the database that you're
connecting to.

685
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,450
An alternative database, other
than Google's default one.

686
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,260
And in this case, I'm pointing
back to my local machine

687
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,960
because my portable server
is running on Port 9335.

688
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,930
Other than that; you
use the Earth API

689
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,180
exactly the same way.

690
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,090

691
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,640
So its sensibility doesn't
just end with the Maps

692
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
and the Earth API.

693
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,050
It can be leveraged through
Python, as well.

694
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,990
And Sean is going to speak
about them now.

695
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,660
SEAN MADAY: As I mentioned to
you, the basis of laptop

696
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,700
Portable is really the open
source Tornado web server.

697
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,930
Inherent in that, and packaged
in that, is the most current

698
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,630
release of Python.

699
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,210
So we're providing you APIs and
tools that allow you to

700
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,460
leverage that Python inside of
your offline applications to

701
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,370
interact with the Google Earth
or Google Maps offline

702
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,100
environments.

703
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,800
So you can imagine this as a
framework for adding extension

704
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,540
services on top of the Google
Earth and Google Maps portable

705
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,400
experiences that you get as
a baseline with Portable.

706
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,060
You can execute Python
scripts.

707
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,910
You can install standard
Python libraries.

708
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,040
You can engage in some
interesting interaction

709
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,520
between the Maps environment and
the type of backend system

710
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,410
that would normally be reserved
for a web server.

711
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:47,660
Right?

712
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,400
So as you can see in the chart
here, you could grab

713
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,550
view-based parameters from
either Google Earth or Google

714
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,440
Maps, grab those click-based
events from the Google Maps

715
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,730
environment, pass those to
this Python engine, do

716
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,790
something interesting with
them, and return those

717
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,120
responses as either JSON or KML,
depending on if you're

718
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,720
using Google Earth
or Google Maps.

719
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,610
So one example of that &mdash; and
just two code snippets.

720
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,960
Again, don't expect you to read
these, but want to make

721
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,400
sure that we provide them in the
slide so you can reference

722
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,760
them after the talk.

723
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,400
First is just creating a network
link, and specifying

724
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,930
which parameters from that
network link should be passed

725
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,290
back from the Google Earth
environment back

726
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:27,750
to the Python server.

727
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:32,980
Then a couple lines of Python
here to grab those parameters

728
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,660
from the URL, do something with
them, and then return

729
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,640
that experience as KML.

730
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,200
Let me show you an example
of that here.

731
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,260
I'm back in Google Earth.

732
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,760
I'll turn back on some of our
Google's offline imagery.

733
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,730
Now, as I zoom and pan here,
you'll notice I have this

734
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,880
network link on the left side.

735
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,130
This is pointing back to a local
service running on my

736
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,480
local host address here.

737
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,780
So local host 9235, and
the extension service.

738
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,680
All the service is really doing
is taking the center

739
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,700
point for the screen, or just
about the center point for a

740
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,250
screen, based on terrain, and
returning it to me as a KML.

741
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,790
This interaction is the type of
interaction you'd expect to

742
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,120
see with a KML network link in
a backend web server on the

743
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,060
internet, or on your
local network.

744
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,989
Here, all of this KML is being
generated on the fly by that

745
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,760
Python engine running
with Portable.

746
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,750
So a very simple Hello
World-type demonstration.

747
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,040
Our goal today was really just
to show you this platform and

748
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,500
this product, to let you know
that our team is working very

749
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,739
intently on taking the
capabilities of Google Earth

750
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,409
and Google Maps from the
online cloud-based

751
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:36,370
environments down to those
tactical scenarios where

752
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,340
internet connectivity is
degraded or unavailable.

753
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,750
We're really looking to your
creativity, and your technical

754
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,900
expertise, to take this
platform, build it out in

755
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,760
interesting ways, integrate it
with your offline applications

756
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,650
for your constituents and
stakeholders, and take this

757
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,460
ecosystem forward.

758
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,620
With that, we're just about
to wrap up here.

759
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,850
I would like to just say that
I'm very fortunate that I get

760
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,410
to be the product
manager for this

761
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,300
awesome suite of products.

762
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,880
I get to come out and
present to you.

763
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,270
But I'd be remiss if I passed on
this opportunity to really

764
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,460
thank the awesome team of
engineers we have back in

765
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,470
Mountain View, and abroad, who
are doing really impressive

766
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,810
things at Google scale to take
the world's geospatial data,

767
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:18,050
make it consumable online and
offline for your use.

768
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,620
With that, we have about
four and 1/2 minutes.

769
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,660
We would love to entertain any
questions you might have Sir,

770
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,240
in the back of the room, you
want to come use the mic so we

771
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,490
can capture it for the video?

772
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:34,410

773
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:34,860
Thank you.

774
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,140
Sorry to make you walk
across the room.

775
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,530
So now can you go use
that microphone?

776
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,362
No.

777
00:35:39,362 --> 00:35:42,260
AUDIENCE: So big use case
here is data capture.

778
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,500
How are we doing with capturing
data then uploading

779
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,525
it back to Google Maps Engine?

780
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:46,970
SEAN MADAY: Yeah.

781
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:47,530
Great question.

782
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:50,490
So we view this as the offline
product that gives you the

783
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,030
view-only capability.

784
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,700
Then what we can envision are
some interesting ways that you

785
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,530
could use local storage, either
through the HTML5 spec,

786
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:03,100
or possibly with that Python
engine, you could do some

787
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,250
local writing to the device.

788
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,240
Handle that field data
collection piece, and then

789
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,280
sync that back up via the Google
Maps Engine API, which

790
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,460
was just announced and released
last week, and then

791
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,110
kind of reiterated yesterday.

792
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,750
A full vector API for Google
Maps Engine that allows you to

793
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,190
write points, lines,
and polygons.

794
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,100
So the pieces are there.

795
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,220
I think that's really where
the developers come in.

796
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,760
We like to think of ourselves
as a platform company.

797
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,150
We like to provide the
platforms and the

798
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,050
capabilities, and then we rely
on you all and your expertise

799
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,560
to make this relevant in your
individual vertical markets.

800
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,020
AUDIENCE: Just a quick
extension.

801
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,970
So there's no thoughts about
sort of editing on &mdash;

802
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,120
well, I guess wouldn't be on the
fly &mdash; but stopping merge

803
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,640
issues, and that
kind of stuff?

804
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,380
SEAN MADAY: So the Google Maps
Engine API handles some of

805
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,260
that version control.

806
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,060
Then some of that is on their
roadmap for how they're going

807
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,270
to handle and deconflict.

808
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,230
Again, what's really exciting
at Google is we tackle these

809
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,420
massive scale problems.

810
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,040
The underlying infrastructure
for the Google Maps Engine API

811
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,670
is a really impressive piece of
technology called Spanner.

812
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,060
There's a great white
paper on the open

813
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,990
internet about Spanner.

814
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,430
Check it out.

815
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:12,440
It really handles all of these
conflicting edits in a very

816
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,630
elegant way, and does really
interesting things at a kind

817
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,160
of a global database scale.

818
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,850
So definitely check that out.

819
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,510
And the integration of the
Google Maps Engine API with

820
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,910
the offline capabilities of
Portable is exactly the type

821
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,230
of thing we're intent on helping
develop, and helping

822
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,840
move forward in this
ecosystem.

823
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,650
AUDIENCE: Thanks very much.

824
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,340
SEAN MADAY: Thank you.

825
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,540
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the new JavaScript API

826
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,610
that's probably coming
out for Google Maps.

827
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,410
The preview functionality that
we saw, and it kind of brings

828
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:45,930
a three dimensional aspects
to a lot of the Maps API.

829
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,880
For Portable, will it also get
that same functionality at the

830
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,840
same time as the preview gets
rolled out to become

831
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,600
mainstream?

832
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,730
SEAN MADAY: Interesting
question.

833
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,650
Interesting way to phrase
the question.

834
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,520
As you can imagine,
we are kind of an

835
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,510
API-driven company, right?

836
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,190
So don't have any announcements
to make, but

837
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,260
we're very focused on how we can
allow you all, and empower

838
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,690
you all, to build on
these platforms.

839
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,160
What you saw the other day with
the new Google Maps is

840
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,310
really kind of a cutting edge,
immersive experience that

841
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,870
still needs some assurance.

842
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,150
Still needs to grow
a little bit.

843
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,900
As that does, as there's more
functionality and capability

844
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,730
added there, we're very focused
on and taking the best

845
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,330
and brightest of that technology
and making it

846
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,360
available offline.

847
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,750
But today, Google Maps Engine
Portable, and what we're doing

848
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,890
with offline, is really focused
on that consumer Maps

849
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,940
and Earth experience that users
have been accustomed to

850
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,970
for the last two years.

851
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,660
Those are the platforms that,
today, consumers are using to

852
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,120
make fast, informed decisions
about geography.

853
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,680
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

854
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,700
SEAN MADAY: Thank you.

855
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,830
AUDIENCE: OK,.

856
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,430
I would like to know with the
Google Maps Portable, so we

857
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:51,770
can craft a Google Maps online
to an offline basis, and also

858
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:57,060
allow for some of the Maps API
that do not need to have

859
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,720
internet access.

860
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,930
Am I correct?

861
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,480
SEAN MADAY: It's a great point,
and a great point of

862
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,820
clarification I'm glad
you brought up.

863
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,120
In the public version of Google
Earth, for instance,

864
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,980
you're seeing lots of different
imagery that Google

865
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,570
has acquired from a variety of
different imagery providers.

866
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,220
And we commingle and mix a lot
of those pixels to provide a

867
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,380
really cohesive visualization
experience.

868
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,040
We don't expect to release the
ability to cut from Google's

869
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,300
public imagery repository.

870
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,920
What we are intensely focused
on is how you can cut your

871
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,400
imagery out of Google Maps
Engine, and then how, also, we

872
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,590
can leverage the power of the
data we use to build Google

873
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,990
Maps tiles, the two dimensional
tiles, and allow

874
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,010
you to take those offline for
use behind the firewall.

875
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,370
We, or on your local device.

876
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:43,370
So that capability for the
Google Map tiles offline is

877
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,500
rapidly coming online.

878
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,460
We're really looking for the
right trusted testers in the

879
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,790
ecosystem who could help us
prove that capability and that

880
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,950
functionality.

881
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:53,590
But to just be very clear,
cutting Google's imagery is

882
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,300
not something that's currently
on our roadmap.

883
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,350
Thank you.

884
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,510
With that, we're out of time.

885
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,390
I would like to thank you
all for your time.

886
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,020
And Avnish and I will be around
afterward, if you'd

887
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,940
like to engage in any
further discussion.

888
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,240
Thanks.

889
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,090
Have a great day.
