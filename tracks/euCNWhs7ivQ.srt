00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,390
EMILY FORTUNA: Good afternoon.

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,193
I'm Emily.

4
00:00:03,193 --> 00:00:04,120
This is Siggy.

5
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,040
We are two engineers on the
Dart team at Google.

6
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,900
And today, we'd like to talk
about some of the features in

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,620
Dart that help make your web
app development experience

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,720
more pleasant and productive.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,290
So this is not &mdash;

10
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,080
oh, OK, thank you.

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,240
This is my impression of
web development today.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,950
It's thriving, doing well, but
things are maybe evolving

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,930
rather than being designed.

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,570
And as a result, a lot of APIs
are the way they are for

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,780
historical reasons, rather than
making the most sense for

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,670
the developer or being
the most readable.

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,950
Additionally, the way the web
handles errors is they handle

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,870
them silently.

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,690
And this can be great for
prototyping when you're trying

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,450
to get your app up and running
to begin with.

21
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,940
But when you have larger
applications, it becomes

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,320
frustrating when you're
trying to pinpoint the

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,580
source of your error.

24
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,600
SIGMUND CHEREM: Now the web also
has a great foundation

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,060
layer at the bottom that
you can use to

26
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,480
build a richer thing.

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,530
But when you're building large
applications, you start

28
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,630
needing to structure
applications, thinking about

29
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,670
models, views, controllers.

30
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,480
And to cope with this need,
people have created

31
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,050
frameworks.

32
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,005
There are actually many
frameworks out there, and they

33
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:19,490
[? noticeably don't ?] work well
together when you want to

34
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,030
actually use a feature or a
widget from one framework into

35
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,730
an app that uses another
framework.

36
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,090
So what we're doing with Dart
is we're taking a new &mdash;

37
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,750

38
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,340
click.

39
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,810
So what we're doing with Dart
is taking a new look at this

40
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,470
problem and giving you
a pleasant feel.

41
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,990
So what we want users to have
now, an experience that you

42
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,170
actually can feel productive
with it.

43
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,140
So we've taken all these APIs
that have grown organically,

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,110
and we revisit them and do a
design of the HTML libraries

45
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,080
so that now it all looks uniform
and something that you

46
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,790
can discover easily.

47
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,480
We're also taking advantage of
a lot of the features that we

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,040
have in the Dart language.

49
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,170
Some of the things helping
making things discoverable.

50
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,330
But it also helps that in Dart,
you can have a lot of

51
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,040
things that give you warnings
ahead of time.

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,699
We have the notion of optional
types and things that can let

53
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,630
you know if you're doing
something wrong.

54
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,630
But if you still want to get
going and ignore the warnings,

55
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,720
you can do it and continue
your productivity in the

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,050
typical [? prototype ?] mode.

57
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,330
EMILY FORTUNA: And as Siggy
mentioned, there are a lot of

58
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,390
frameworks that are being
developed to help you organize

59
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,540
your models and your views.

60
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,140
But they don't necessarily
work together.

61
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,830
And currently, they're
developing some web standards

62
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,510
to help you do this
on your own.

63
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,820
And Dart is keeping pace with
these standards and

64
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,820
integrating them into their
libraries in the language so

65
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,600
that you can use all these
features on any browser that

66
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,290
you want, today.

67
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,180
So we'll take a quick look at
how some of the design of the

68
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,910
Dart language and Dart libraries
have influenced the

69
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,950
HTML library in making your
web apps experience.

70
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,640
So let's take a little
example.

71
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,980
Let's say you have a collection
of nodes, HTML

72
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,200
nodes, and you want to
loop through them.

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,010
What might seem like the common
way, or what you would

74
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,690
think to be the default way to
do this, would possibly trip

75
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,430
you up in JavaScript.

76
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,530
So if you do a simple little
For Each loop, you're not

77
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,340
going to get each node.

78
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,620
Because you have this array-like
object you're

79
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,600
looping through, you
get your indexes.

80
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,440
And then you also get the links
and some other things.

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,360
In Dart, we return native
Dart lists.

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,270
So yes, you can have a pony.

83
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,690
So everything behaves just like
a Dart list natively in

84
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,330
the language.

85
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,700
And so you can loop
through your nodes

86
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,550
as you would expect.

87
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:57,760
And so native lists are not the
only thing we're returning

88
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,150
from the HTML library.

89
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,010
We've also adopted a lot of
other Dart types, for example,

90
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:08,310
futures and streams, and are
returning them as well.

91
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,860
So as an example, the
idea behind a future

92
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,620
is just like a callback.

93
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,940
But the difference
is that you &mdash;

94
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,450
so you have your &mdash;

95
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,430

96
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,850
this is your function call.

97
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,820
And when you had a callback,
you'd be

98
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,290
putting it right here.

99
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,940
With a future, you return the
future that when the value

100
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,840
completes, you do
your callback.

101
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,655
And the great thing about
futures is they

102
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:36,580
are easier to compose.

103
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,170
And so if you have a sequence
of events that needs to run,

104
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,240
then you can easily
have them chain.

105
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,710
So we have then, and
do something else.

106
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,940
As opposed to callbacks, where
you might have sort of

107
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,420
spaghetti callbacks going from
here to here and so on.

108
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,140
SIGMUND CHEREM: So you probably,
if you went to the

109
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,840
earlier talk today on Dart and
what's new in Dart, you

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
probably saw some more
examples on futures.

111
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,410
Just briefly, another thing that
Emily was saying about

112
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,050
composition.

113
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,290
Like you can see here, I
have this CatchError.

114
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,870
This is a way of now handling
both normal control flow and

115
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,400
exceptional control
flow with futures.

116
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,340
Another way in which composition
is actually

117
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,330
helpful with futures is that
you can run multiple

118
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,110
asynchronous operations
together.

119
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,870
They can run in parallel, and
they can then create another

120
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,800
future that waits for an
individual future to complete.

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,470
So when we're looking at the
HTML library, we know that

122
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,370
there's a lot of things that
are asynchronous by nature.

123
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,560
And what we want to do is to
take advantage of these types

124
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,750
and use them in this library.

125
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,590
Now one clear example
of that is the use

126
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,520
of a network request.

127
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,630
When you want to do a network
request, you create an object

128
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,720
in JavaScript, for example.

129
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,250
You set it up by sending a
callback so that you know when

130
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,340
the answer is actually
available, and so on.

131
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,820
In Dart, we can actually now
just get a future back.

132
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,250
And now you have all the
existing libraries available

133
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,450
to you that are functioning
on normal futures.

134
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,110
You can also use them on
this particular future.

135
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,780
And in the same way that we have
futures, there's a notion

136
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,320
of streams, which is
like a repeated

137
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,640
version of the future.

138
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,140
And we use that a lot in
events, when listening

139
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,150
[? for ?] events from the UI.

140
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,380
EMILY FORTUNA: So Dart
also has libraries.

141
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,200
And we use this to advantage
in splitting up

142
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,520
your huge HTML namespace.

143
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,430
So we have sublibraries.

144
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,970
For example, all the things that
are related to WebGL are

145
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,150
in their own space.

146
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,440
And also, in addition to
semantically grouping these

147
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,850
things together, this saves
you some typing.

148
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,090
So for example, we have all the
SVG elements and all the

149
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,280
SVG types in its own library.

150
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,140
So you don't have to type "SVG
element." You could just say,

151
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,160
rect element.

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,550
And so on with HTML elements
and others.

153
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,200

154
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,910
Dart also has named arguments.

155
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,160
And we use this to our advantage
in helping make the

156
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,110
APIs more pleasant
to work with.

157
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,220
So here's an example we have.

158
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,140
We're programmatically
initializing a mouse event in

159
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,890
JavaScript, or one
way to do it.

160
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,520
And it has a whole bunch of
optional arguments, but

161
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,420
they're positional.

162
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,280
And so if we wanted to specify
one non-default value, this

163
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,040
metaKey value, then we have to
put all of the other default

164
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,190
values in between.

165
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,380
And when you look back at this
later, it's a little hard to

166
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,360
read and understand what was the
programmer intending when

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,820
they wrote this line.

168
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,030
So with named arguments, all you
have to do is put the ones

169
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,530
that are not your
default values.

170
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,780
And so it's much more
clear what the

171
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,030
programmer's intent was.

172
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,810

173
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,190
Named arguments also are helpful
for discoverability.

174
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,410
One other way that the DOM APIs
deal with named arguments

175
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,720
is they take the dictionary, and
you can have collections &mdash;

176
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,960
or you put in keys
to specify the

177
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,670
behavior for these functions.

178
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,790
This works, but it's not
so discoverable.

179
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,090
So you have to look up what
magic keys do I need to insert

180
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,430
in my dictionary to
make this call.

181
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,500
In Dart, we've expanded a lot
of these dictionaries into

182
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,730
named arguments so that when
you're typing, the Dart Editor

183
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,280
will autocomplete and show you
that I had these optional

184
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,080
arguments that I could
also include.

185
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,260
SIGMUND CHEREM: Now, named
arguments are one way in which

186
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,990
we can improve discoverability.

187
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,440
And there are many other things
in the Dart language

188
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,445
that also help.

189
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:19,570
And the fact that we actually
have types, and we can

190
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,560
actually exploit this
in many ways.

191
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,390
For example, when we're talking
about CSS and doing

192
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,180
CSS manipulations, the very
common way to do that today in

193
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,820
JavaScript is to do strings and
concatenate strings and

194
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,880
put them together.

195
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,030
Now here, we can actually have
a specific type for talking

196
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,010
about the style, for talking
about the property of the

197
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,690
background color of this
particular style

198
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,289
object, and so on.

199
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,980
Now what we're going to do
next is Emily's going to

200
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,450
actually show you a little
demo in our editor and

201
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,230
demonstrate a little bit of
how these things work.

202
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,360
EMILY FORTUNA: So as a matter
of fact, this whole

203
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,175
presentation we're presenting
is a web page.

204
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,640
It's a web app.

205
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
And it is written in Dart.

206
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,580
And so our demo will be adding
on some functionality to your

207
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,260
presentation.

208
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,960
So in the presentation mode,
let's say I have this div

209
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,700
here, and I want to draw
your attention to it.

210
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,480
So might want a yellow box to
grow when I mouse over it.

211
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,810
So how do we do that?

212
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,640
Well, we flip over to
our Dart editor.

213
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,270
And this div's ID is
discoverable, so

214
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,540
we'll look it up.

215
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,790
So first we query.

216
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:32,710

217
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,590
And then we want to see
what events are

218
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,230
available for this div.

219
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,990
So we say, on, and autocomplete
helps us.

220
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,590
And we want a mouse event, so
onMouse, and we'll do Over.

221
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,910
A mouseover produces a
stream of repeated

222
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,750
events when this happens.

223
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,870
So we want to listen
to those events.

224
00:09:52,870 --> 00:10:01,740
And when this happens, we want
to call toggleStyle to &mdash;

225
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,950
I've already added the CSS
title to add this little,

226
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,200
bring your attention
to the box.

227
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,280

228
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,530
So we save and refresh.

229
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,020

230
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,740
Now when I mouseover this
div, we've got a nice

231
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,438
little yellow glow.

232
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:27,530
[APPLAUSE]

233
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,510
EMILY FORTUNA: Also, jQuery is
a super popular framework for

234
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,910
developing your web apps.

235
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,300
And for a couple different
reasons.

236
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:41,110
It helps with working with CSS
transitions and modifications.

237
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,450
And it also helps eliminate
some cross-browser

238
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,420
differences.

239
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,670
In Dart, we provide these things
in the language itself.

240
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,840
So you don't have to import any
extra libraries, and we

241
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,640
worry about all this for you.

242
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,540
So as an example, let's take
a look at CSS manipulation.

243
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:03,220
At the very top, we have how you
would add a class in plain

244
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,800
old JavaScript.

245
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,310
And as I mentioned, this
presentation is in Dart.

246
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,840
So we're querying all our
slides, and we're adding this

247
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,840
swing class to the elements.

248
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,490
In jQuery, it's much
more concise.

249
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,340
You just query all your slides,
and you call addClass.

250
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,650
In Dart, we have
the same idea.

251
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:27,162
We have a collection of the
classes that are applied to

252
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:28,200
the element.

253
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,880
And we add swing to them.

254
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,140
So as a demo of how this
works, since this is a

255
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,890
presentation written in HTML,
you think, well, great.

256
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,920
I would love to write
all of my other

257
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,480
presentations in HTML.

258
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,260
I really would like to switch
and use the web for all of

259
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,290
these things that I develop.

260
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,550
But in my favorite presentation
software, there's

261
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,450
this great animation effect that
really is important to

262
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,410
drive the point home, and
I can't switch to HTML.

263
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,430
Never fear.

264
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,960
We have ridiculous slide
transitions as well.

265
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,950
So with this little button, I'm
adding this swing class.

266
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,960
And we have absurd slide
transitions.

267
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,530
All right.

268
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,820
Additionally, Dart works &mdash;

269
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:29,890
so JavaScript has, and jQuery
works on, improving your &mdash;

270
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,670
eliminating some cross-browser
differences.

271
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,530
So an example, we have WebRTC,
which is the Real Time

272
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,570
Communication protocol for
video chat and such.

273
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,280
And a lot of browsers have
implemented this, but they are

274
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,110
behind various prefixes.

275
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,370
So you have Mozilla
WebKit and so on.

276
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,730
And so if you wanted to use this
in JavaScript, you'd need

277
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,090
to determine which of these was
defined and then call it.

278
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,550
In Dart, we deal with
all of this for you.

279
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,230
So all you'd call
is getUserMedia.

280
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,640
And we determine which browser
you're on and so on.

281
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,600
And the same is for CSS
selectors as well.

282
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,990
So as a little example, we
have our WebRTC demo.

283
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:18,600

284
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,530
And OK, so this is Chrome,
small potatoes.

285
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,425
Let's switch over to
another browser.

286
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,990

287
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,863
And I will prove that it
works here as well.

288
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:34,592

289
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:35,842
Yes.

290
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:40,570

291
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,070
All right.

292
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,320
Oh, let's stop that.

293
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,940

294
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,850
jQuery has also popularized
the idea of chaining.

295
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,340
How this works is we have a
snippet of jQuery, not how you

296
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,240
would actually write
it in real life.

297
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,880
But what we're doing is we're
applying a bunch of different

298
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,130
styles to this cascades-demo
element.

299
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,000
And so we're calling element.css
repeatedly to

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,120
apply all of these different
classes.

301
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,510
jQuery uses &mdash;

302
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,260
often, in many of its APIs,
will return the original

303
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,120
calling object.

304
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,067
So it will return this element
so that then, you can chain

305
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:22,540
your calls.

306
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,290
You could say element.css
textShadow, .css fontFamily,

307
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,700
and so on, so that
you don't have to

308
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,040
repeat yourself as much.

309
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,190
In Dart, we have the
same thing in the

310
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,540
form of method cascades.

311
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,460
And the great thing with method
cascades is they work

312
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,326
on any function in Dart.

313
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:45,400
So you don't have to rely on the
API designer to write it

314
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,240
that way for you.

315
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,080
You can use it on any
function you want.

316
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,810
So this also works on functions
as well as setters.

317
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:57,310
So this example, we're setting
a bunch of different styles

318
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,650
using this double dot notation
to set some styles.

319
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:08,190
And so as a demo, we are setting
the style of our web

320
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,400
page, our HTML presentation.

321
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:19,420
And what better style to set
than '90s retro webpage?

322
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,354
All right.

323
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,689
We'll go back to the future.

324
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,160
SIGMUND CHEREM: Cool.

325
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,480
So we've seen great things
that we've done so far,

326
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,620
improving that base layer.

327
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,700
How do you actually interact
with HTML.

328
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,570
The next thing we're going to
look at is what happens at a

329
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,130
higher level?

330
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,460
How do you build large
web applications?

331
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,750
Now, I don't know about you,
but sometimes I'm curious

332
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,320
about a very awesome feature
that I see on a webpage.

333
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,600
And I open up the Web
Inspector, and I see

334
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,020
something like this.

335
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,410
Right.

336
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,220
This is actually my Gmail inbox,
and it's obviously not

337
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,030
very readable.

338
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,730
In fact, there, I think that's
actually part of &mdash;

339
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,070
each one of those divs can
actually represent one of my

340
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,450
emails as like threads
on the inbox.

341
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,960
But what this highlights is
that we're actually using

342
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,020
something else to
build this app.

343
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,530
It's very unlikely that people
wrote the code this way.

344
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,480
What we have is that people
use frameworks.

345
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,930
And these frameworks actually
generate or try and form the

346
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,690
code and minimize things
in a way that it

347
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,865
will generate that.

348
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:18,820
Now if you use a different
framework, most likely it's

349
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,360
going to minimize it in a
different way, and they're not

350
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,350
going to be compatible
with each other.

351
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,300
So this is a general
problem on the web.

352
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,540
And many people out there had
been thinking about this and

353
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,100
thinking how to make these
things better.

354
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,150
And it's actually very exciting
times because there

355
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,190
have been now a lot of proposals
and new standards

356
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,680
being proposed to add
a lot of features

357
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,980
to the browser itself.

358
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,020
And the idea is that all the
things that are done by these

359
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,470
frameworks can be supported
directly in the browser.

360
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,700
And that way, they can actually

361
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,210
interoperate more easily.

362
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,620
So you might have actually seen
a lot of this content

363
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,600
earlier in Google I/O, in
different talks, like

364
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,580
different web components
talks and so on.

365
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,200
But I'm going to dive a little
bit more into this in the

366
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,770
perspective of Dart.

367
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,220
Now what are all the
standards about?

368
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,109
There are mainly like two points
I want to highlight.

369
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,430
One is how do you actually
save time and be more

370
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,819
productive writing code so you
don't write glue code, stuff

371
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,369
that is just always the same.

372
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:15,410
And a typical example of that is
binding your UI in the part

373
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,520
of the view [? view ?]

374
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,650
with your data model.

375
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,380
And it's very common that you
want to actually do that

376
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,880
automatically.

377
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,069
The other part is how do you
actually encapsulate what

378
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,230
you're writing and make it
reusable so you can actually

379
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,200
work with a lot of people,
and you can share

380
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,500
your code with others.

381
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,640
And this is where things like
web components, custom

382
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,080
elements, Shadow DOM, and all
these things come in.

383
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,040
So in Dart, we have this project
called Web UI where we

384
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,170
are keeping pace with what all
these standards are doing and

385
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,110
implement them for you in
Dart so you can start

386
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,590
experimenting, giving us
feedback, so we can actually

387
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,300
give it back [? into ?]

388
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,395
the entire community.

389
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:47,360
EMILY FORTUNA: And use
them on any browser.

390
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,210
SIGMUND CHEREM: That's right.

391
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,910
So what we're going to do next
is talk in a little bit more

392
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,080
detail about some of
these features.

393
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,370
So the first one I want to talk
about is observability.

394
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,470
In JavaScript, ECMAScript 7,
there's a proposal that has

395
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,100
been accepted to add
the notion of

396
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,500
observing data changes.

397
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,570
So the idea that you can create
an object, and then you

398
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,710
can call something like
Object.observe.

399
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,320
And then after that point, any
time you mutate that object,

400
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,390
you add a property, you change
the value of the property, you

401
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,490
will get notified
in a callback.

402
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,380
So something very similar we're
going to be actually

403
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,670
supporting in Dart.

404
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,280
The way we declare it is
slightly different, just in

405
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,400
the way that the languages are
just slightly different.

406
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,970
In our case, we use an
annotation saying @observable,

407
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,440
and we're going to make it,
that class, in some way

408
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,080
observable.

409
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,570
So once you have this, there's
actually a great

410
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,680
power in your hand.

411
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,370
You can start writing programs
in a more reactive way.

412
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,770
You can listen to the changes
that come from data from the

413
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,930
network and react to that
in your own way.

414
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,720
But it's especially handy when
you want to glue this code

415
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,690
into your UI and
create now data

416
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,940
bindings that are automatic.

417
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,410

418
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,970
EMILY FORTUNA: So as an example
of this, we have a

419
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,380
little counter here.

420
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,710
And this is useful in the
context of our presentation if

421
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,920
we're watching time.

422
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,760
This is counting since we've
refreshed the page.

423
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,230
How do we implement this?

424
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, let's take a look
at the Dart code.

425
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,600
We have a Counter class.

426
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,830
And the interesting part
is this down here.

427
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,870
Our timer is every second
incrementing our counter.

428
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,170
OK, so that's fine.

429
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,750
But what does it look like?

430
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,565
How do we notify the web page
to update and redraw?

431
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,090

432
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,640
That's it.

433
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,280
We put in this little double
mustache syntax.

434
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,640
And this tells us that
we need &mdash; we

435
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,850
want to bind the values.

436
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,710
When value is incremented, we
want to update the webpage.

437
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,790
And we, underneath the scenes,
take care of all the

438
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,670
boilerplate of when to update
the view and listening and so

439
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,930
on, so you don't have
to worry about this.

440
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,750
SIGMUND CHEREM: So now the
syntax that you see here might

441
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,820
be actually slightly different
than what you've seen in other

442
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,260
presentations because everything
is actually

443
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,970
changing under our feet,
and we're just

444
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,050
keeping pace with that.

445
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,190
So this is actually likely
going to change in just a

446
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,670
couple days, in fact, to
be slightly different.

447
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,850
So what we just show here
is an example of one

448
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,980
direction of bindings.

449
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,340
You have something changing in
your data model, and you want

450
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,980
to reflect that in the UI.

451
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,600
Another thing that you
might want to do is

452
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,650
go the other way.

453
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,026
You can actually then have an
input box, and then any change

454
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:22,810
that you make in the input
box be reflected

455
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,200
in your data model.

456
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,970
So here I have a little example
where on the first

457
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,550
line, we have something
that is similar

458
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,770
to what we had before.

459
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,730
I have a model where I'm going
to actually read a value and

460
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,040
put it in my UI.

461
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,550
And on the second line, I have
the input box and the special

462
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,940
attribute bind-value
does the other

463
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,810
direction of the binding.

464
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,100
Now here's the same
code running.

465
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:53,240
And whenever I type something
here, with typos, you see them

466
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,510
reflected immediately on the
other part of the UI.

467
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,880
So what's going on here is
actually, when you actually

468
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,940
look at the Dart code,
[INAUDIBLE]

469
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,920
is again very simple.

470
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,500
It's just an observable
object, and that's

471
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,020
all I had to write.

472
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,050
Now, bindings are very useful
for these simple examples, but

473
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,620
they actually scale to make
it possible to write more

474
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,100
sophisticated things as well.

475
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,240
Given that we're doing this
presentation in Dart, here's

476
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,100
another interesting thing
that we could do.

477
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,550
Say I want to have an index
of all my slides.

478
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,090
So what I'm showing here is a
little list of all the slide

479
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,080
titles that we have in
this presentation.

480
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,670
And I can even search for them,
and I can say "future."

481
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,140
I can actually click on one of
those slides, and it jumps to

482
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,400
the slide number.

483
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,210
And I can come back.

484
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,710
Now this is all written using
a lot of these bindings and

485
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,370
features that are becoming
available and things like

486
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,050
model-driven views.

487
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,470
So here's what that
code looks like.

488
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,470
What we have in the first two
lines is similar to what you

489
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,540
saw before.

490
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,540
It's an input box where
we're binding the

491
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,500
value of the query.

492
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,480
So any time you type something
in the search box, that's now

493
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,830
bound into the particular
variable.

494
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,140
Then we have this other
variable, matchingTitles, that

495
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,870
is selecting those things
that actually match

496
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,360
that particular query.

497
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,870
And we're using that inside of
a template to do this kind of

498
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,280
iteration process.

499
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
We're saying that for every
title that matches, we're

500
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,790
actually creating a list
item in our UI.

501
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,820
And here's essentially where
we're actually putting the

502
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,950
text of the title
in our slide.

503
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,000
And finally, we have this extra
attribute here to hook

504
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,200
up our event listening.

505
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,170
So anytime we click on
it, we're jumping to

506
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,870
a particular slide.

507
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,590
Now, this is actually something
that looks similar

508
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,810
to how normal HTML allowed you
to put, like, event handlers

509
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,420
in JavaScript.

510
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,050
But there's a difference here,
in that we're actually

511
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,330
transforming this and generating
code in a way that

512
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,290
it would actually be efficient
by default.

513
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,160
It's actually doing the code
that you would normally write,

514
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,970
if you want to make it
efficient, by hand.

515
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,040
Like finding the element and
attaching [? event handlers ?]

516
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,300
programmatically.

517
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,070
And it's also made in a way
that is secure by default.

518
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,930
And I want to spend a couple
more seconds talking about

519
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,330
security in general.

520
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,160
So in the Dart team, we care a
lot about how do we actually

521
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,900
make creating web applications
easier.

522
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,030
And one thing that people
stumble a lot is on how do you

523
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,450
protect your application from
things like cross-site

524
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,110
scripting attacks.

525
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,290
When you're using things like
templating, a lot of the

526
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,800
things can actually be prevented
more easily.

527
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,270
Particularly when you see this
binding here, we know that I'm

528
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,170
injecting some content in
the middle of that HTML.

529
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,800
But because I know where I am,
I know for once that, OK, I'm

530
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,350
just been putting text here.

531
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,750
There's no way I can actually
put something

532
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,070
like a script tag.

533
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,630
I know that I'm injecting it
that way when I clearly am

534
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,420
running this code.

535
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,680
And there are many other
things like that,

536
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,900
that you can do.

537
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,860
So even in our .HTML libraries,
we're currently

538
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,350
looking into how we make
something like

539
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,250
[? inner HTML ?]

540
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,050
safer and have either validation
or checks or things

541
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,920
that you can do.

542
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,410
And if you're using templating,
reduce the cost as

543
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,430
much as possible so you
don't see any overhead

544
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,680
[? at runtime. ?]

545
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,110

546
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,510
Cool.

547
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,540
So now that we have these views,
and we know we can

548
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,810
create something really pretty,
the next thing we want

549
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,440
to do is make it reusable.

550
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,470
So this where custom elements
and Shadow DOM and all these

551
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,220
things come along.

552
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,330
So here at the bottom, there's a
little bit of sample syntax.

553
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,750
And you might have seen
this earlier today.

554
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,390
Basically the idea is that I can
define a view and wrap it

555
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,080
with a name.

556
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,780
And I'm going to use this name
as a tag in my HTML.

557
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,280
So here I'm saying the name of
my tag or something like

558
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,230
my-element.

559
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,000
And later on, I can use that tag
in my HTML in the bottom

560
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,500
thing, my-element foo.

561
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,580
EMILY FORTUNA: And the way I
like to think about this is

562
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,780
object-oriented programming
for HTML.

563
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,070
So here, we're simply
declaring our

564
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,980
custom element or class.

565
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,250
And then we're instantiating
it.

566
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,950
And it can varying behavior
depending on each element that

567
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,343
you instantiate.

568
00:24:48,343 --> 00:24:49,190
SIGMUND CHEREM: Exactly.

569
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,510
So one thing that I can
highlight related to that is

570
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,530
that custom elements allow you
to also override or extend the

571
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,870
behavior of other elements
that exist in the DOM.

572
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,440
And in this example we have
here, it is extend div.

573
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,910
And when I see that, I know that
actually this is going to

574
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,920
behave like a block element,
not like a span

575
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,340
element, for example.

576
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,910
And when you instantiate
an element, there's an

577
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,530
alternative syntax that is
based on the fact that it

578
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,180
knows that, OK, there's
some base element

579
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,330
that we know out there.

580
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,780
And I can say, well, this
particular div is an instance

581
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,390
of my-element, which is
a subkind of div.

582
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,710
So I want to switch to the
editor and show you a more

583
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,250
realistic example.

584
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:32,380
And what we're going to do
is open one slide here.

585
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,550
This slide, in fact, is a
custom element itself.

586
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,000
And what I have here
on the top is a

587
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,890
commented out custom element.

588
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:46,540
I'm just going to clean this
up and go through the code

589
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,610
little by little so that
we can actually

590
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,000
see what it's doing.

591
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,970
Basically, I'm interested in
adding a slide number to my

592
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,900
presentation.

593
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,890
I just want to know what
slide I'm on right now.

594
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,570
So I'm going to add
a custom element

595
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,910
called my slide number.

596
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,360
It's going to be essentially
a div.

597
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,910
And I'm going to associate with
that element a little bit

598
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,910
of Dart code.

599
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,170
So here in this attribute, where
I say constructor equals

600
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,940
SlideNumber, I'm saying that
this is a class in Dart that I

601
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,150
want to associate
with my element.

602
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,970
Now here at the bottom is a
definition of the class.

603
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,070
It has a bunch of fields.

604
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,410
One of them is, what's the
current slide, which is just

605
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,120
looking that up from
my presentation.

606
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,840
And finally, we have this
template object with this

607
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,370
template tag, where I'm defining
what the actual

608
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,230
element looks like.

609
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,530
And I'm saying, well, it's
actually going to have this

610
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,100
text, and it's going to actually
show the current

611
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,740
slide number.

612
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,880
So let's go to the bottom.

613
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,090
We have here an instance
of this slide number.

614
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm going to put
it in my slide.

615
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,700
I'm removing those comments.

616
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,330
We now save, refresh.

617
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,400
And once we're here, you'll see
this is slide number 25.

618
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,510
So once you have one of these
elements, you can actually do

619
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,770
a lot of other things that also
resemble object-oriented

620
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,880
or general programming.

621
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,350
For example, you can actually
pass information to your

622
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,490
custom element using
attributes.

623
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,040
So I can actually put here
something like my-attribute

624
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:19,110
and say, "Hello Dart!" And what
I have up here is that we

625
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,590
actually already have a field
named myAttribute.

626
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,690
You may have noticed that I have
a little difference in

627
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,270
the syntax.

628
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,450
This is a camelCase
letter here.

629
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,640
This is using dashes.

630
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,200
This is that HTML doesn't
allow you to have case

631
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,980
sensitivity.

632
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,010
So in Dart, we say, well,
let's translate.

633
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,740
Every time you have a dash,
we're going to capitalize the

634
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,846
next word and associate that
with a field in this class

635
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:40,360
that is associated with
your custom element.

636
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,330
Once we have that, we can
actually just put this

637
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,410
myAttribute in the middle
of my template.

638
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,660
Attribute.

639
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,630

640
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,080
And now when we refresh, we will
see there that it says,

641
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,320
hey,

642
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,910
"Hello Dart!" Cool.

643
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,490
So another thing that you get
with custom elements is that

644
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,080
once you define it once, you can
use it in multiple places.

645
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,830
You don't have to use it only
where you define it.

646
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,645
You can actually also
import it and use it

647
00:28:03,645 --> 00:28:06,600
in other HTML pages.

648
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,180
And the way you do that
is by using this link

649
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,740
rel="import" syntax.

650
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,810
This is another standard out
there from the web community.

651
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,220
And back to our presentation,
let's open another slide here.

652
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,150
This is the slide that has
that particular text.

653
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,080
And I'm just commenting
out the link rel.

654
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,730
And then here at the bottom,
we have the other syntax we

655
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,370
have to create custom
elements.

656
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,020
Our slide number with
our attribute.

657
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,790
And we save, we refresh.

658
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,570
EMILY FORTUNA: So just to
clarify, we're importing from

659
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,610
our original definition
into this slide.

660
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,110
SIGMUND CHEREM: Exactly.

661
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,230
So right here, up here, this
href is essentially the name

662
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,630
of the other slide number.

663
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,085
In fact, if I have a typo, and
I say, oh, I forgot to put

664
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:54,470
this dot here, and I save.

665
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,190
You actually see some errors
at the bottom.

666
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,070
And actually, I wanted to
highlight this because in

667
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,470
Dart, we have a lot of power
making tools available to you

668
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,520
that actually give you
a lot of feedback.

669
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,140
In particular, the Dart editor
focuses a lot of energy on

670
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,020
analyzing Dart.

671
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,190
But it's also pluggable.

672
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,080
And in our case, with WebUI,
we managed to also add

673
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,880
additional information to
understand the HTML itself.

674
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,380
So here at the bottom,
you see this actual

675
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,340
file doesn't exist.

676
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,990
That's why you see that
red curly line.

677
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,860
But actually, interestingly, you
also this second warning

678
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,800
saying the slide number is
not defined anywhere.

679
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,410
I couldn't find a definition
because, well, it probably

680
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,390
came from that file.

681
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,650
But at least you actually get
some feedback if you actually

682
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:36,640
had a typo and used the wrong
name of your custom element.

683
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,460
Right.

684
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,660
EMILY FORTUNA: So in this
case, we were passing an

685
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,850
additional, a different
attribute here as well.

686
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,800
SIGMUND CHEREM: Yeah.

687
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,210
EMILY FORTUNA: All right.

688
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,960
So I'm sure you guys were really
blown away by that

689
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,580
slide number example.

690
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,290
And now you want to put it
in all of your web apps.

691
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,420
So the next great step is
fortunately, you can because

692
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,590
we have this package management
system called Pub.

693
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,700
It allows you to share any
Dart code, also custom

694
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,930
elements that you write.

695
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,110
And you can easily
put them into &mdash;

696
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,090
work with any project
of your own.

697
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,090
So in this example here,
we are using &mdash;

698
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,930
see these little tabs here?

699
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,990
This is actually a custom
element that

700
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,820
neither Siggy nor I wrote.

701
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,780
A third party developer, Kevin
Moore, wrote this.

702
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,790
SIGMUND CHEREM: Who
is right there.

703
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,790
EMILY FORTUNA: He ported a bunch
of bootstrap widgets.

704
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,986
And so the way we added this to
our presentation is all we

705
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:37,380
had to do is we have this
little pubspec.

706
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,360
We added our widget library.

707
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,570
And then in our HTML, in the
presentation, we added a link

708
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,150
rel, just like we did before.

709
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,190
And then we instantiate
it with his

710
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,855
custom element tab name.

711
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:53,740
And it's that simple.

712
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,900
And here's another one
that he wrote.

713
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,150
It's a little accordion
widget.

714
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,350

715
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,180
So we went through
a whole bunch of

716
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,550
different things today.

717
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:09,030
These are some of the resources
that talk about a

718
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,820
lot of these standards that
are being developed.

719
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,010
And if you'd like to read
more, feel free

720
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,320
to check them out.

721
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,890
And everything we've shown you
today is available to try it.

722
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:24,050
You can download the Dart
SDK, and it will work.

723
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,660
SIGMUND CHEREM: In fact, there
are people already using this.

724
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,060
For example, the Blossom team,
they already actually had been

725
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,000
using and even put up also
some of their widgets in

726
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,380
another package in Pub.

727
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,770
EMILY FORTUNA: And the
Glyph3D app as well.

728
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,110
SIGMUND CHEREM: Oh, the
Glyph3D app as well.

729
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,130
So there's a lot of things that
are continually changing.

730
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,940
All the standards are actually
still shaping up.

731
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,240
And a lot of things
are basically

732
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,170
moving under our feet.

733
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,770
So as I mentioned earlier,
there's more things coming,

734
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,190
more things changing, and
we're just keeping pace.

735
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,310
Now we're going to
be here around

736
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,590
to answer any questions.

737
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,020
We would love for you guys to
join us in the code lab

738
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,050
tomorrow, where we're going to
actually hands on be using a

739
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,240
lot of these features.

740
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,410
And we're happy to take
questions here.

741
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,850
Then we're afterwards going to
be upstairs in the Dart booth

742
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,770
and in the Office Hours area.

743
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,186
Thank you.

744
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:18,154
[APPLAUSE]

745
00:32:18,154 --> 00:32:23,632

746
00:32:23,632 --> 00:32:25,970
SIGMUND CHEREM: Any questions?

747
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,532
Oh, you're here.

748
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:29,900
EMILY FORTUNA: Hi.

749
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,160
MARK: Hi.

750
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
My name is Mark.

751
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,330
So you're building a very new
language for all the web.

752
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,760
Could it be there's a bigger
picture here for Google, like

753
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,170
you want to use this language in
many of your products like,

754
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,420
for example, Google+?

755
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,510

756
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,930
EMILY FORTUNA: Google is
using Dart internally.

757
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,370
And we hope that these
projects will see the

758
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,170
light of day soon.

759
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:56,720
MARK: OK.

760
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,970
So it's great to see some
support also from your

761
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,670
company, then, here.

762
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:00,740
SIGMUND CHEREM: Yeah.

763
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,010
There's definitely commitment
internally to actually

764
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,120
continue using it.

765
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,870
And we're starting to see
adoption as well, and it's

766
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,000
very exciting.

767
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,250
MARK: Thank you.

768
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,640

769
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:10,980
EMILY FORTUNA: Hi.

770
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,210
PAUL: Hi.

771
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,380
I'm Paul from [INAUDIBLE].

772
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,890
I wanted to ask, is Dart Chrome

773
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,710
extension ready right now?

774
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:25,100
Because since Chrome team
introduced manifest version

775
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,710
two, there is a content
security policy.

776
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,110
And I wanted to ask,
is this ready for

777
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,510
applications for Chrome?

778
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:38,050
SIGMUND CHEREM: So to clarify,
you're asking about using Dart

779
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,380
to write your own extension?

780
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:39,690
MARK: Yeah.

781
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,770
SIGMUND CHEREM: Yes.

782
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:45,210
Yes, so that's definitely
possible.

783
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,030
There's even a mode in which you
can actually compile your

784
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,950
Dart code into JavaScript and
use it in an extension.

785
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,120
There's a special flag you
need to pass into DartJS

786
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,030
compiler to make it CSP
compliant so it doesn't use

787
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,890
things like [? evolve ?]

788
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,670
and stuff like that.

789
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,930
But it's definitely possible.

790
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,260
PAUL: I am wondering about
developing because when you're

791
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,130
developing, you use
the internal

792
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,690
server in Dart Editor.

793
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,710
And when you develop an
extension, you load this

794
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,370
extension as a file,
as an app.

795
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,090
EMILY FORTUNA: So the only
reason we used a server for

796
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,060
this is for our WebRTC demo
because you can't do that from

797
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,739
file, locally.

798
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:23,980
PAUL: OK.

799
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,010
So I don't &mdash;

800
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,429
EMILY FORTUNA: Everything
else &mdash;

801
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,670
PAUL: I don't need to use
the server, right?

802
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,239
SIGMUND CHEREM: Right.

803
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,870
PAUL: OK.

804
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,966
Thanks.

805
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:31,389
EMILY FORTUNA: Hello.

806
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,837
AUDIENCE: Actually, that's
more or less what I

807
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,409
was going to ask.

808
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,760
But basically, what you showed
us today, typically, you would

809
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,350
have compiled that to a page
that'd be served up, just like

810
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,460
any other static page.

811
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,199
And you'd have to use Ajax and
whatnot, then, to get your

812
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,020
data back and forth, right?

813
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,380
SIGMUND CHEREM: Yes.

814
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,040
I mean, that's definitely &mdash;

815
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,550
basically, the deployment step
typically involves something

816
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,419
like that, where you're bundling
all the Dart code and

817
00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:57,690
then shipping essentially just
one JavaScript file or a

818
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,320
couple of JavaScript files that
you want to actually put

819
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,420
in your app, and their
resources.

820
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,300
AUDIENCE: And so the way you
were using the web components

821
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,880
with the data binding, you could
do that using standard

822
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,860
JavaScript objects that you were
pulling via, say, JSON

823
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,740
and then bind them into
the UI that way?

824
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,560
SIGMUND CHEREM: You can use
JSON and things like that.

825
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,650
In the current state, you would
have to still use Dart

826
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,485
in a way to say, OK, given this
JSON, how do I process it

827
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,090
and create Dart objects
out of that?

828
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,750
But then your client-server
interaction

829
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,400
continues to be the same.

830
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,050
You can still have JSON over the
wire and seamlessly work

831
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,130
and support clients that could
talk, for examplee &mdash;

832
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,510
or be written in JavaScript that
would actually use JSON

833
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,830
for their rendering.

834
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,440
And you can use Dart
on the other hand.

835
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,980
AUDIENCE: Has that JSON to Dart
object conversions all

836
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,650
been addressed in the
client side then?

837
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,250
SIGMUND CHEREM: Yes.

838
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,830
Yes, there's a Dart call in JSON
library, basically, that

839
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,640
has the JSON parse and
the Stringify APIs.

840
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,674
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

841
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:55,105
EMILY FORTUNA: Hello.

842
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:55,970
AUDIENCE: Hey.

843
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,970
So I've been playing with Dart
a little bit lately.

844
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,360
And something's been annoying
me about it, and I'm pretty

845
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,270
sure it's due to my ignorance.

846
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,270
I'm hoping you can
help me out.

847
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,370
The way I've usually used web
technologies is I have an

848
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,460
existing project, and I just
add a little bit of jQuery.

849
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,040

850
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,020
Dart, it feels like most of the
learning material says,

851
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,585
start a new project in
the Dart Editor.

852
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:15,870
And so there's a lot of magic.

853
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,120
And I realize there's
command line tools.

854
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,030
But if I want to use a web
component from Dart in an

855
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,290
existing project, I need to
compile my Dart to JavaScript,

856
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,520
and I need to compile my HTML,
because there are some

857
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,660
transforms.

858
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,620
Is there kind of documentation
for making Dart play nice with

859
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,620
my existing project?

860
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,815
SIGMUND CHEREM: There's some,
but there should be more.

861
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:38,360

862
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,340
In a brief way, I can say, a
lot things are possible.

863
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,080
But some of the things, there's
still a lot of steps

864
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,740
which we want to take to
actually make things a little

865
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,730
bit more minimalistic.

866
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,530
Like, say you just want this
component, and that's

867
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,740
all that you want.

868
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,580
Those are things that are
still not there yet.

869
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,940
EMILY FORTUNA: And I'd say that
the focus right now is

870
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,920
making one great experience
through the Dart Editor.

871
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,230
And so, yes, we'd love to
expand in future time.

872
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,955
But our current focus
is like one whole

873
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:09,200
ecosystem that works great.

874
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,000
SIGMUND CHEREM: One great thing
where things are moving

875
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,240
is the new changes that we're
seeing in model-driven views

876
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,050
and in custom elements are
pushing us to also move a lot

877
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,200
more of our logic to be more
dynamic and to work more later

878
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,630
on, so that you don't have
to use so much of the

879
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,050
tools ahead of time.

880
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,720
So I think that's also
going to help.

881
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,000
AUDIENCE: Cool.

882
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,310
Thank you.

883
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,760
SIMON: Hi.

884
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,560
Simon from Quebec City.

885
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,570
Coming from a grid background,
one tool that I heavily rely

886
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,150
on is Maven to manage
my build cycle.

887
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,410
I was wondering if there's such
a tool that you would

888
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,390
recommend for programming Dart,
for managing [INAUDIBLE]

889
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,910
into the build life cycle.

890
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,990
EMILY FORTUNA: Sorry,
what's the tool?

891
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,290
SIMON: Maven.

892
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,760
EMILY FORTUNA: Maven.

893
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,500
SIGMUND CHEREM: Maven.

894
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,330
So I might need some
more context.

895
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,710
So basically, you have a tool
that helps you in the whole

896
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,320
process of building things and
bundling things together and

897
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,070
deployment and such.

898
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,300
SIMON: Yeah, automating testing
and deployment, and

899
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,030
compiling and dependence
management and &mdash;

900
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,480
SIGMUND CHEREM: Definitely.

901
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,790
That's something that
we actually started

902
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,690
doing some work on.

903
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,830
And we're hoping that on one
hand, that it should be able

904
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,655
to start using tools
that already exist.

905
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:15,535
Hopefully, there is nothing
Dart-specific about a lot of

906
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:16,970
these things.

907
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,040
But we also have moments where
we actually have realized that

908
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,680
having a Dart-specific solution

909
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,670
actually sometimes helps.

910
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,710
And we have a project called
buildtool, for example, that

911
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,435
is starting to look
into this area.

912
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,160
How do you have, for example,
a build server end to your

913
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,830
picture that helps you
coordinate all these things

914
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,375
between different tasks and
steps that you have to do?

915
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,170
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

916
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:35,620
AUDIENCE: And op.

917
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,750
SIGMUND CHEREM: And
op, that's true.

918
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,860
Kevin [INAUDIBLE], there's
another project out there that

919
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,365
you can try.

920
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:43,491
EMILY FORTUNA: In Dart.

921
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:44,741
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

922
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,750

923
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,710
SIGMUND CHEREM: So Pub is
actually, I don't know if &mdash;

924
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,090
yeah, Pub handles a lot of the
package management and the

925
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,130
installation process.

926
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,440
So that's another thing
that helps.

927
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,960
And they are adding
the features to do

928
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,810
deployment as well.

929
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,370
So that you can take all the
packages that initially were

930
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,480
distributed and how to minimally
put them together so

931
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,030
that you know what you
have to deploy.

932
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,450
AUDIENCE: Hey.

933
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:12,510
How does it compare to, or why
is it better than Angular?

934
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:17,100
SIGMUND CHEREM: It's actually
a little bit of apples and

935
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,290
oranges in that you could
ask the same question.

936
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,730
How do you compare Angular
and the standards?

937
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,110
Right?

938
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,980
And I think that Angular has a
lot of features that are at a

939
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,940
high level.

940
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,390
And they're actually
very rich.

941
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,040
Things like routing, things
like dependence injection.

942
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,770
And I think all this [INAUDIBLE]
can actually be

943
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,930
put on top of what
we have as well.

944
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,690
And I'm hoping that actually,
that's the direction we will

945
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,860
move forward so that the
standards can be a common

946
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,910
ground that you can then pick
and choose different

947
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,370
frameworks and get
something better.

948
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:43,720
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

949
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,710
But I guess the key difference,
really, is you're

950
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,250
programming Dart versus
JavaScript, which hopefully

951
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,620
Dart, the language, makes things
nicer, your overall

952
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,160
development experience.

953
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,570
But we hope to get most of
the same functionality.

954
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

955
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:04,100
Does Dart act as a polyfill
when web components or

956
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,080
templates are not available and
not even in the browser?

957
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,680
I mean, does it &mdash;

958
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,600
when compiling to JavaScript,
it emulates that function as

959
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,560
not available?

960
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,190
EMILY FORTUNA: I'm sorry.

961
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,830
SIGMUND CHEREM: Sorry,
I couldn't hear.

962
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,520
AUDIENCE: What components and
templates are part of the W3C

963
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,830
standards, right?

964
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,120
SIGMUND CHEREM: Yes.

965
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,770
So a lot of the standards,
there's the Shadow DOM is

966
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,370
there, custom elements.

967
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:25,830
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

968
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,570
But they're not fully supported
by old browsers.

969
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,800
SIGMUND CHEREM: They're
not today.

970
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,810
AUDIENCE: Does that
do something to

971
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,290
fill this gap when &mdash;

972
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,010
SIGMUND CHEREM: So right now,
what we're currently doing is,

973
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,360
yes, filling that gap, creating
an interface that

974
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,420
looks the same and works
in everywhere.

975
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,530
The term that commonly
people talk about,

976
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,420
polyfilling, right.

977
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,640
It's just the same.

978
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,170
So we're doing our version of
that in Dart so that it has

979
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,110
the thing experience.

980
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,240
And ideally, when it's supported
in the browser, then

981
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,980
it's just simply used directly
rather than poly.

982
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,295
AUDIENCE: OK.

983
00:40:57,295 --> 00:40:57,610
That's all right.

984
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,860
Thanks.

985
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,650

986
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,440
EMILY FORTUNA: We're
out of time.

987
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,830
But we will come talk
to you guys offline.

988
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,230
Or come talk to us.

989
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,660
SIGMUND CHEREM: Yeah,
come to us.

990
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,710
We'll be hanging out here.

991
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,005
EMILY FORTUNA: Thank you.

992
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:08,660
SIGMUND CHEREM: And we're going
to be upstairs as well

993
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,560
in the booth.

994
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,160
Thank you.

995
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,645
[APPLAUSE]
