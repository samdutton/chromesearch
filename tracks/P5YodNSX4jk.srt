00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,830

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,430
Hi.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,290
My name is Andrei Mouravski
from the Dart team.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,730
And I'm here to tell you how the
Dart project can help you

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,620
become a better developer, and
the tools that are available

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,210
for Dart developers to
make better code.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,110
The Dart project is different
from other web development,

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:34,420
because we have a lot of tools
included in the SDK that you

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,100
can get everything, batteries
included.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,220
Traditional web development is
scattered, and you have to

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,230
find your own package manager,
and you have to work with a

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,500
bunch of different tools that
don't really integrate well.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,430
But the great thing about Dart
is that it's very toolable.

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,590

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,820
You can get started with
Dart by going to

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,840
dartlang.org/tools, where you
can download the SDK and the

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,090
editor, which we'll be using
for most of this talk.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,300
The editor has all of the tools
that you need to write,

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:22,170
edit, test, document, analyze,
publish, and deploy your

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,330
applications to the world.

21
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,210
Something about me is that
people tell me that I'm too

22
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,900
timid, and I have a problem
where people don't take me

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,550
seriously on the internet.

24
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,750
So I want to build a Dart
application that can help me

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,860
be more persuasive on message
boards, comment threads.

26
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,660
So let's go make something
that will help.

27
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,510
Let's make an argument clinic
app that helps you become a

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,100
better speaker.

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,970
So we're going to build
this in several parts.

30
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,380
We're going to make a text
enhancer that takes your text

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,140
and turns it into something
better.

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,630
We'll write the unit tests
so we know it works.

33
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,460
We'll have documentation so
that we can use it in the

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,009
future, and others
can use our code.

35
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,400
And then we'll put it together
into a web app, and then share

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,640
it with the world.

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,210
So let's begin by building the
library text enhancer.

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,680

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,350
So this is the Dart Editor.

40
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:31,080
It was built as a plug-in on top
of Eclipse, but it is its

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,360
own separate editor.

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,040
And it has many useful features
like auto-complete

43
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,180
and refactoring that
I will show you.

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,920
So this library takes code and
turns it into uppercase so

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,270
your comments are
more persuasive.

46
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,520
But what if we want to change
this code later?

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,380
We have this quiet
text.toUpperCase.

48
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,010
And maybe I want to change how
I want to enhance text.

49
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,140
So let's refactor this in one
step so that we can have it

50
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,350
individually.

51
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,290
I could highlight text
and right click.

52
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,170
Click Extract Method, which
pops open a dialogue.

53
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,130
And here, this will let me
extract a method and rename

54
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,210
it, and have it as a
separate method.

55
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,800
So let's call this something
persuasive.

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,440

57
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,000
So now you see that we have
a new method that was

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,400
added to the file.

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,980
And the previous instance of
that code was replaced here

60
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,240
with the new call
to the method.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,380
So how do I know my code is
doing what I want, if it's

62
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,140
really enhancing my text?

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,740
Well, we would use
a unit test.

64
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,880
But where would I get
a unit test library?

65
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,260

66
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,570
The pub package manager is
available from the Dart SDK.

67
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,240
And it exists as a service and
a tool that you can use to

68
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,100
share, use, and distribute
packages, which are

69
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,470
bunches of Dart code.

70
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,660

71
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,050
Pub.dartlang.org is a great
place you can go to check out

72
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,850
all the different packages
that are available.

73
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,400
There are packages for
everything from servers to

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,440
database connectors to
task runners, which

75
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,300
are all worth using.

76
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,890
The entry point to any package
is a file called pubspec.yaml.

77
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,740
And this is a file that
describes your

78
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,250
application or package.

79
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,470
And it also lists the
dependencies that your package

80
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,010
depends on.

81
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,260
So let's take a look at that.

82
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,680

83
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:00,430
The Dart editor has a handy
pubspec editor so that you can

84
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,720
edit the fields in
an easy fashion.

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,270
Here you see that I have the
name of the package, the

86
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,860
author of the version,
and the description.

87
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,620
And we're going to
add a dependency.

88
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,490
So I know that there is a
great pub package called

89
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,240
unittest, so I'm going to import
that by clicking the

90
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,490
Add Dependency button.

91
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,670

92
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,910
So this will just say that the
unit test package is a

93
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,880
dependency for your
own package.

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,240
We click Pub Install from here
or from the Tools menu to

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,005
install all the dependencies.

96
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:40,190

97
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,730
So this populates the packages
folder with all the packages

98
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,580
that we depend on.

99
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,440
So you see that there is this
meta package which was

100
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,480
included even though it's not
one of our dependencies.

101
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,640
Transitive dependencies
are also

102
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,840
included in your own package.

103
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,750
So unit test depends on meta,
which is added to your own

104
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,010
package so that the unit task
can function properly.

105
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,746
Let's go to one of our tests.

106
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:12,300

107
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,320
So here we have a simple test
to check if the shout method

108
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,540
does what we think
it's going to do.

109
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,240
But you see that there are these
warnings on the side

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,820
that the test function
is not defined.

111
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:34,050
We need to import the test
library into our Dart file so

112
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,300
we can use it.

113
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,970

114
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,700
And you do that by using
the package:import.

115
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,760
So this will import the unit
test package, which cleared up

116
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,370
all the warnings for test.

117
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,210
However, there's another warning
here, which says that

118
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,730
the shout is not defined.

119
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,620
Even though we're in the same
package, you still need to

120
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,220
include all of the Dart files,
the individual dependencies &mdash;

121
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,230
in this case the
shoutify file.

122
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,440
And you import that the
same way as you

123
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,333
would any other package.

124
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:14,150

125
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,050
So now you see that the
warning went away now.

126
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,840
But I forgot a semicolon.

127
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,310
And the Dart editor will tell
you any time you forget

128
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,240
something like this.

129
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,840
It will highlight errors.

130
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,820
So it expected to find
a semicolon.

131
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,800
So we're going to add a
semicolon and save.

132
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,370
And now this code should work.

133
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,650
You can test that the code
works by hitting the Run

134
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,230
button up here, or using
Control-R or

135
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,190
Command-R to run it.

136
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,780
So let's run it and see
what the output is.

137
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,240
The unit tests all passed,
as you see here,

138
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,490
and everything succeeded.

139
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,740

140
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,420
So what happens if a
unit tests fails?

141
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,920
Let's change this to from "a
little mouse" to "a little

142
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,990
moose." And this is going to
fail because we changed how

143
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,950
the test runs.

144
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,680
But let's see what actually
is happening.

145
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,930
In the Dart editor, you can
set a breakpoint to pause

146
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,160
execution of the code by right
clicking in the margin and

147
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,080
hitting Toggle Breakpoint.

148
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:26,750
So now when we hit Run, the unit
test library has paused.

149
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,400
And you can see the stack trace

150
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,230
of the current execution.

151
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:37,000
And you see that the loud text
is different from what we

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,760
expect it to be.

153
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,270
And so this test will fail.

154
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,100
The debugger lets you step into
code and step over code,

155
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,650
just like a debugger in other
IDEs, so that you

156
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,970
can examine the code.

157
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,000
And it'll give you the values
of any of the local and

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,650
top-level variables.

159
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,270
So let's stop debugging
and click Resume.

160
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,930
And you see that our tests
failed, and they printed out

161
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,410
all sorts of unhappy messages.

162
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,270
And you see the failure
up here.

163
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:14,400
Let's take out this breakpoint
and move on.

164
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,330
So we have these unit tests.

165
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,560
But how do we know if our code
is going to be stable, or if

166
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,220
other people try to depend on
the shoutify library, whether

167
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,370
they can be assured that
the code works?

168
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,240
Or, for that matter, what
happens if one of our

169
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
dependencies stops working?

170
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,440
What if unit test has a breaking
change and we need to

171
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,490
change things?

172
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,010
Well, for this we have
drone.io, which is a

173
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,260
continuous integration service
that monitors your GitHub

174
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,640
repository or code.google
repository or BitBucket.

175
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,350
And whenever it detects a change
in your repository or

176
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,810
in a repository of one of your
dependencies, or if one of

177
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,800
your dependencies is changed,
then it will rerun all of your

178
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,120
tests and then submit to you a
notification of whether it

179
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,540
passed or failed.

180
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,610
So let's try that.

181
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,960
So right now I have
a failing test.

182
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,210
And previously, I had
a passing test.

183
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:26,320
So let's go to commit all
the changes I have now.

184
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,950
And I'm going to push
this repository, and

185
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,880
we'll see what happens.

186
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,130
I'm switching over
to drone.io.

187
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:38,080

188
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,760
And my push is still
happening.

189
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,060
But now that it is finished
pushing, you see that on

190
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,310
drone.io, the build has
already started.

191
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,850
We can click into it.

192
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,620
And quickly enough, it shows
that our build failed.

193
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,510
This is also available as a
badge that you can embed into

194
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:04,560
a repository or as a dynamic
png, which I have on the

195
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,100
package here.

196
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,550
So it used to be passing, but
if we refresh, you see that

197
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,070
it's failing.

198
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,880
So anybody that goes to
pub.dartlang.org into your

199
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,170
package can see that your latest
tests are not passing.

200
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,430
So they might not want
to use your package.

201
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,350
Let's go back and fix that.

202
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,270
And we won't worry about
pushing it again.

203
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:33,520
So to maintain a good package,
you probably want to have good

204
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,450
documentation.

205
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,210
Documentation is sort
of like flossing.

206
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,820
It's something that you don't
always want to do, but you'll

207
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,320
really thank yourself
later if you do it.

208
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,140
Documentation in Dart
looks like this.

209
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,730
There are two forms of
documentation comments.

210
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,260
There is the /** model,
which lets you

211
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,650
do multi-line comments.

212
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,540
And then there's the ///, which
lets you do single line

213
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,380
comments, or you can chain a
couple of /// comments to have

214
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,830
a multi-line comment.

215
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,180
And once you add documentation,
your

216
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,070
documentation will look
something like this.

217
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,620
So it will look like the API
documentation for Dart itself,

218
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,650
which you can see here.

219
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:28,740
So api.dartlang.org is a great
resource for seeing all of the

220
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,840
packaged libraries that
come with Dart, and

221
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,100
seeing how they work.

222
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,250
So now that we have
documentation and we have unit

223
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,960
tests, we might want
to publish our app.

224
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,330
So it's going to look like it's
failing, but we still

225
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,370
want to get our new
code up on pub.

226
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,250
The way that you do this
is by using pub itself

227
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,030
to publish the app.

228
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,140
You can do this in several ways,
but one way is to go

229
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,000
back to your pubspec.

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,790
And there's a button next to
the Pub Install button that

231
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,450
says publish to Publish
to Pub.

232
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:15,550
You click on this, then a
dialogue will ask you if you

233
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,850
really want to publish this.

234
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,050
And I want to really enable
people to be heard on the

235
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,240
internet in their comments and
threads and, really, when they

236
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,580
have important things to say.

237
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,760
So let's publish this.

238
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,850
So this is going to go through
the process of

239
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,770
publishing to pub.

240
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,290
And you see that it was
uploaded successfully.

241
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,390
If we go back to pub,
we see that

242
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,000
our version has increased.

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,530
So our latest package is already
on pub, and other

244
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,220
people can start using it.

245
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,650
So now that we are done with
that, how about we go back to

246
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,100
our web app.

247
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,790
So what is our web app going
to look like to begin with?

248
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,750
So this is what I
built before.

249
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,150
And right now it doesn't
really do anything.

250
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:16,050
Right now, you can edit some
text, and click a button.

251
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,480
But it doesn't do anything.

252
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,480
It doesn't really make my
message any more clear.

253
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,210
So let's do that by modifying
this code.

254
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:32,020
We can go to the Dart file I
have for this application.

255
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,830
And you see here that on
a click, it updates the

256
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,950
value of the text.

257
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:44,650
We want to increase the volume
of our message, so we need to

258
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,350
use the shout.

259
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:54,180
Here we can just modify the text
to be shout(text), which

260
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,520
is how our method works.

261
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,490
And we already know it works
because of the unit tests.

262
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,270
However, we don't have
this test included.

263
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,900
You could try to import
it like this.

264
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:11,120

265
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,030
But this isn't going to work,
because this is a different

266
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,530
application, and it
doesn't know about

267
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,180
the shoutify library.

268
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,830
So we go to the pubspec
for this library.

269
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,400
And we add it as a dependency
just like we did with unit

270
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,700
test, except now we have
our own package that

271
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,650
we can depend on.

272
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,465
So we run Pub Install to get
everything up and running.

273
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:37,870
And we go back here.

274
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,420
And we save again.

275
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,030
And now everything is working.

276
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,780
So now we can deploy
this to the web.

277
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:52,040
One tool that you have available
is Dartium, which is

278
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,440
a development browser that
has the Dart virtual

279
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,020
machine built in.

280
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:07,370
To run it, you right click on
your main Dart or HTML file,

281
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,620
and they you say
Run In Dartium.

282
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,220
However, one thing that's great
about having the VM

283
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,680
included is that you can debug
your application right from

284
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,990
the Dart editor.

285
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,640
So let's Toggle Breakpoint right
here, just like we did

286
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,260
earlier, and right click Run In
Dartium, which will run our

287
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,280
new application.

288
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,340
So let's see what happens.

289
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:40,780
So let's say "I disagree with
you," which is lackluster.

290
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:49,860
Click here, and it clearly makes
your message pop more.

291
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,980

292
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,174
Let me try this again.

293
00:16:55,174 --> 00:17:02,930

294
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:08,980
To get the debugging, I needed
to run Dartium from the HTML

295
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,579
file, which I did not.

296
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,170
And so now I am waiting for
the Dartium to load so

297
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,880
I could debug it.

298
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,950

299
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:30,440
But as it is not loading, I am
going to show you how else you

300
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,550
can deploy your Dart
applications.

301
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:37,740

302
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,620
There is a common myth that goes
a little bit like this.

303
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,130
But Dart is not just
for Chrome.

304
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:52,440
It runs in all modern web
browsers using a compiler

305
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,020
called dart2js, which
converts Dart code

306
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,690
into JavaScript code.

307
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,770
We have been making a lot of
progress and many improvements

308
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,430
in reducing the size of the
JavaScript code that's

309
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,630
generated from Dart code.

310
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:12,670
So if after you minify using
dart2js and run gzip on your

311
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,215
web server, you can reduce the
size of your JavaScript code

312
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,050
to something really manageable
and deploy it everywhere.

313
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,270
However, you're not just
writing in JavaScript.

314
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,000
You have the full complement
of Dart tools, and you have

315
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,680
the type system, and you have
the package manager &mdash;

316
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,210
all of this stuff included which
you wouldn't get with

317
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,820
JavaScript.

318
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,140
So let's see what this looks
like in different browsers.

319
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,470
So to run in JavaScript,
you right click

320
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,050
again on the HTML file.

321
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,650
And you click Run
As JavaScript.

322
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,650
And this will create
the JavaScript

323
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,940
version of your code.

324
00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:00,020
So you see here that when you
click on the button, you see

325
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,880
that it works.

326
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,990
Something else you can do.

327
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:09,920
In browsers that support source
maps, you can go into

328
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,370
the actual Dart file from the
developer tools, and debug it

329
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,110
straight from the browser,
from Dart in this case.

330
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,890
So here I could set
a breakpoint in

331
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,610
the developer tools.

332
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,310
And now when I click on this
button, it actually pauses the

333
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,340
execution of the
JavaScript app.

334
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,160
But I'm still looking
at the Dart code.

335
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,080
So this makes it very easy to
debug your applications in

336
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,970
different browsers where there
are source maps available.

337
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,310
And this is included
automatically whenever you

338
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,560
compile the dart2js.

339
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,030

340
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,320
So just to show you that we
mean business, here is the

341
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,480
same application in Firefox &mdash;

342
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,940
works as you would imagine.

343
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,700
And here it is Internet
Explorer.

344
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,290
And I forgot to refresh.

345
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,280
And here it works perfectly.

346
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,790

347
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,790
So let's go back and see
what else we could do.

348
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,080
So I've shown you how to build,
test, deploy, and

349
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,150
document this package.

350
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,540
But maybe you're not too
interested in working in the

351
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,190
Dart editor.

352
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,430
Or maybe you want to SSH into
a machine where you're more

353
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,090
comfortable working.

354
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,450
Or maybe you have a different
text editor.

355
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,000
Well I'm happy to say that all
of the tools that I've shown

356
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,760
you &mdash; dart2js, the documentation
generator, pub &mdash;

357
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,520
are all available on
the command line.

358
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,950
So here I could do
pub install.

359
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,020
And if I was in the
right directory

360
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,270
it would have worked.

361
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,310

362
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,390
I do pub install.

363
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,070
And it does the same thing.

364
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,470
It resolves all dependencies
and installs them.

365
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,350
You do the same thing with
dart2js, the Dart

366
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,710
documentation tool &mdash;

367
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,330
all of this can run from
the command line.

368
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,900
But we also have support for
a full complement of text

369
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,980
editors and IDEs like Eclipse
and WebStorm, which have

370
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,490
really great integration.

371
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,870
But I want to show you something
that we have fairly

372
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,700
recently is our Sublime
integration.

373
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,650
So you can install the Dart
plug-in for Sublime using the

374
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,900
package control plug-in.

375
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,990

376
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,680
And it's as simple as doing
Package Control, Install

377
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,970
Package, and then Dart.

378
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,170
And fairly quickly, your package
will be installed.

379
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,780
And then you could set
syntax to Dart.

380
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,780
And then your Dart code will
be syntax highlighted.

381
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,570
From here, you could also
do pub install.

382
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,170

383
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:57,950
You can also run the analyzer,
which will tell you about any

384
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,980
errors you have in your code.

385
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,710
For example, if I remove this
semicolon and I run the

386
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,670
analyzer, then it will tell
me that there is a missing

387
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,400
semicolon right here
in Sublime.

388
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,120
So you can keep your
productivity high with the

389
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,760
editor that you're used to.

390
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,320
There's way more tools than I
could possibly go into in this

391
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,450
short amount of time.

392
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,530
But here a couple of libraries
that are available in pub.

393
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,730
There's really excellent
task runners.

394
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,300
The web UI library is great
for building modern user

395
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,200
interfaces with a model
view, whatever model.

396
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,400
There is a great build
pack for Heroku.

397
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,620
So if you have a server-side
application, you could push it

398
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,660
to Heroku in one step and have
your application live.

399
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,830
And there's way more.

400
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,880
And more is coming
out all the time.

401
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,560

402
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,020
So if we go back to the argument
clinic and see if we

403
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,680
accomplished everything we
wanted to, we saw that we were

404
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,570
able to be more persuasive
on the internet.

405
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,350
And we made it possible for
other people to use our

406
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,690
application by sharing it
as a web app and as

407
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,030
a package on pub.

408
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:22,160
So perhaps if somebody wants
to mash up a text enhancer

409
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,650
with some social network,
they could do so

410
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,480
using the APIs provided.

411
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,220
And I think I've made the
world a little better by

412
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,515
making your comments
more persuasive.

413
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:39,420

414
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,610
Thank you for listening
to this talk.

415
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,300
If you want to find out more
about Dart, you can go to

416

dartlang.org.

417
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,510
There we have a full complement
of videos,

418
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:55,640
articles, documentation,
tutorials, mailing lists.

419

And most of all, I want you to
go out and be productive, and

421
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,900
give it what for.

422
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,150
Thanks.

423
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:16,145
