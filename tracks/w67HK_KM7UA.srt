00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,390

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,110
BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,190
interesting developer community.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,170
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,310
has asked this question.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,430
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,887
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

8
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:18,600
answer show, so if any
of you out there

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,852
would like to ask questions.

10
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:28,070

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,450
MALE SPEAKER: Open up one
browser and make sure that it

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,380
worked there.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,380
These days, it's not unusual
for me to have about five

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,080
different browser windows
open at the same time.

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,040
CHRIS EPPSTEIN: A good portion
of my front-end development

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,270
time is spent trying to
figure out how I can

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,560
best build a feature.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,090
And a good portion of that is
spent finding the right

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,180
website where I can find out
the information I need.

20
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,110
MALE SPEAKER: Right now,
there's a lot of great

21
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,190
information that's out there,
but it's spread across a bunch

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,260
of different sites.

23
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,030
CHRIS EPPSTEIN: Oftentimes, the
difference between getting

24
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,940
that information quickly and
right and getting it wrong can

25
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,690
be the difference between
something taking an

26
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,590
hour and all day.

27
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,809
DIVYA MANIAN: As the web moves
forward, we have different

28
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:07,700
operating systems, different
browsers, different devices,

29
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,250
and not just that, the standards
that we use for the

30
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,810
Web keep changing rapidly
day in and day out.

31
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,780
MICHAEL CHAMPION: It's hard to
find the documentation for

32
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,390
what works across all of them.

33
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,770
This is something we all need
to solve together as a

34
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,330
community for the web to
be the best it can be.

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,370
PAUL IRISH: The founding members
of Web Platform Docs

36
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,970
have contributed quite a bit
of content to create the

37
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,250
foundation for Web
Platform Docs.

38
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,080
It's a new community-driven
site that aims to become a

39
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,740
comprehensive source for web
developer documentation.

40
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,090
But it's also an open community,
which means you can

41
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,930
contribute by sharing your
knowledge and your experience.

42
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,150
MICHAEL CHAMPION: What we need
now is a larger community to

43
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,340
get in there and deepen
the content

44
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,930
with their own expertise.

45
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,390
TIM BERNERS-LEE: Join
in the conversation.

46
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,710
Make this website the best.

47
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,170
DIVYA MANIAN: Just go to
webplatform.org and sign up.

48
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,650
MICHAEL CHAMPION: Share
your expertise.

49
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,925
TIM BERNERS-LEE: Make it exactly
just what you and I

50
00:01:57,925 --> 00:01:59,700
need for building a web page.

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,210
PAUL IRISH: Join the
community and start

52
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,690
learning and sharing today.

53
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,992

54
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:11,850
PETER LUBBERS: Welcome to the
Chrome channel on Google

55
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,260
Developers Live.

56
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,356
I'm really excited today to talk
to you about a special

57
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:18,522
episode of webplatform.org,
or Web Platform

58
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:19,930
Docs, as we call it.

59
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,107
Today, I'm in the studio.

60
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,270
My name is Peter Lubbers.

61
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,370
I'm a program manager in the
Google Chrome team in

62
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,150
developer relations.

63
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,306
And recently we've been working
on a lot of the

64
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:32,563
infrastructure and getting
ready for the big

65
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:33,840
announcement.

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,330
With me in the studio today,
I have Alex Komoroske.

67
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:37,880
Hi, Alex.

68
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,600
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Hi.

69
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,505
PETER LUBBERS: And Scott Rowe.

70
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:40,425
SCOTT ROWE: Hello.

71
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:42,220
PETER LUBBERS: Alex, tell us a
little bit about the project

72
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,765
and &mdash; well, first of all, tell
us what you do at Google and

73
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,250
what you've been doing
for this project.

74
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:46,940
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Sure.

75
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,870
I'm a product manager
on Chrome's Open

76
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,520
Web Platform team.

77
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,270
I've been involved in this
project for a few months now.

78
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,460
The point of it, I guess, is
that the Web Platform is this

79
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,820
amazingly powerful platform,
and there's lots of good

80
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,830
documentation around, but
it's all over the place.

81
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,720
It's very hard to find
it in one place.

82
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,330
So we thought, well, why don't
we just create a site that

83
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,546
anyone can edit and so that you
can have one place to go

84
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:11,100
to find all the documentation?

85
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,510
And a whole bunch of folks
thought this was a great idea.

86
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,220
A number of other organizations
are involved

87
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,880
from the beginning, which I
think is really exciting.

88
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,320
So we just announced it
yesterday, the first step in a

89
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,990
very long journey to make this
into the comprehensive site

90
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,080
for web developer
documentation.

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,740
PETER LUBBERS: I think that's an
important thing we need to

92
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,930
talk about a little bit more
is that what you're finding

93
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,880
today is an alpha version.

94
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,160
It's something that
we really &mdash;

95
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,510
with the different stewards, all
of the different browser

96
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:48,810
vendors and other companies like
Adobe and Nokia and HP

97
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,900
really wanted see some content,
put some content out

98
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,150
there, and then start developing
it in the open.

99
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,390
So not really hiding it and
building something that's

100
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,840
fantastic and release it in 2015
or something like that.

101
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,180
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Or earlier.

102
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,140
PETER LUBBERS: Right, right.

103
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,510
So Scott, what do you do?

104
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,000
And what have you done
for this project?

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,730
So what do you do at Google?

106
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,750
SCOTT ROWE: I'm a technical
writer, and I work on Web

107
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,440
Platform Docs almost
exclusively.

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,150
Like the other browser vendors
on the project, we do have

109
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,790
some full-time people dedicated
to curating and

110
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,640
ensuring the quality of
this documentation.

111
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,030
We're looking at this as a very
high-profile project, and

112
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,670
we want it to succeed.

113
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,890
PETER LUBBERS: That's actually
a really good thing.

114
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,080
As opposed to other projects
that may have a single writer

115
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,610
or a single person behind
it, this is really a

116
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,680
collaborative effort.

117
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,970
But also, as you point out, we
have all of the stewards have

118
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,200
full-time people dedicated
to this great resource.

119
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,630
So hopefully, they will also be
able to guide the community

120
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,300
in developing more and
more of this content.

121
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,080
So about we take a look at the
site and start stepping

122
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,480
through it?

123
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,110
SCOTT ROWE: Go for it.

124
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,240
PETER LUBBERS: So if you look at
the home page, you'll find,

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,710
of course, the video that
we opened up with.

126
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,270
And, of course, you'll find
different areas at the top &mdash;

127
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,360
Docs, we have a forum,
blog, chat,

128
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,850
tutorials, and other things.

129
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,960
One of the important things
about this is that right now,

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,720
the real focus is on
the Docs area.

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,250
So, in fact, when you hear about
this project, you'll

132
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,790
hear the abbreviation WPD &mdash;

133
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,580
Web Platform Docs &mdash;

134
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,510
webplatform.org Docs.

135
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,660
In fact, if you go there, if you
click on Docs, you'll end

136
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,710
up on the Docs home
page, if you will.

137
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,010
This page really has
links to all of the

138
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,790
information we have.

139
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,980
Scott, do you want to tell us
a little bit about what kind

140
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,490
of content you might
expect on the site?

141
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,460
SCOTT ROWE: Sure.

142
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,470
We break our content into three
basic areas &mdash; concepts,

143
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,380
reference, and tutorial.

144
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,180
That's pretty standard across
any technical writing effort.

145
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,250
Within each of those categories,
we further break

146
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,530
the content down into
its component parts.

147
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,030
So for the CSS reference
documentation, you will see

148
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,220
things like CSS properties
and selectors.

149
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,300
And then eventually, you'll burn
down into a property like

150
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,400
this &mdash; font size.

151
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,630
PETER LUBBERS: Let's take
a look at that a moment.

152
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,030
So you have font size here.

153
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,220
As I open that up, I find
a lot of different

154
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,210
tags applied to this.

155
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,610
We'll come back to
those later.

156
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,960
But you can find an
overview table.

157
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,550
You have a syntax area, the
actual values described,

158
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,840
examples, and other
information.

159
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,450
One of the most valuable things
that I think this

160
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,700
project will bring
to the table is a

161
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,080
compatibility matrix.

162
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,500
And again, this is just to
reiterate, it's just an alpha

163
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,660
version right now.

164
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,740
But the nice thing is everybody
can contribute.

165
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,630
I've gone through many sites
in the past, and there are

166
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,310
some great resources out there,
for example, Can I Use.

167
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,670
It's a fantastic resource.

168
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,040
I think all of the web
developers that I've talked to

169
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,380
are pretty much aware of that,
and they use that sometimes on

170
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,680
a daily basis.

171
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,150
Of course, any of those
resources are fantastic,

172
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,230
except you can't edit them.

173
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,620
Many times, I've written the
owner of a website saying,

174
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,290
actually, this has
been changed.

175
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,770
You should include
this browser.

176
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,700
And it's just very hard to
do as a single person.

177
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,350
So having help from the entire
community is really powerful.

178
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,590
So you can see here
compatibility

179
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,930
for desktop and mobile.

180
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,760
As I said, this is a
work in progress.

181
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,320
But the content has been
seeded to get started.

182
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,040
We also have tutorials.

183
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:03,850
So the tutorials area, sort of
a large grouping of content

184
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,130
that tells you not just as a
reference topic would about

185
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,940
the specific feature, but how
you can really use them.

186
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,990
Many times it will include
multiple topics, for example,

187
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,170
how you build something using
the audio element or something

188
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,990
using a set of features, maybe
canvas and web socket to build

189
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,700
a compelling case study,
things like that.

190
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,910
So let's take a look at that.

191
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,960
For example, the connectivity
tab, if I open that here, the

192
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,830
connectivity feature
here, there's

193
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,750
already three tutorials.

194
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,950
As I mentioned, a lot of this
content has been seeded from

195
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:47,380
areas like MDN, from MSDN,
from HTML5 Rocks.

196
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,610
Opera has great articles
on web development.

197
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,630
All of the stewards have
contributed a lot of the

198
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,150
content already to be here.

199
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,480
For example, here the Web
Socket tutorial is a Web

200
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,730
Socket basics tutorial.

201
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,630
It has a little description of
what the problem might be here

202
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,920
and code examples and really
allowing you to get

203
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,470
started with that.

204
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,440
And really, the power of Web
Platform Docs, I think I would

205
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,540
sum it up with is one thing,
which is the Edit button.

206
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,790
Clicking on Edit opens
up this Edit page.

207
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,470
I want to drill into that
a little bit more.

208
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,670
Of course, it's very easy
to edit a small typo.

209
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,030
If you see a typo, something
very small or something you

210
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,460
know should be rewritten,
go for it.

211
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,300
You can literally just
go in this page &mdash;

212
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,750
and we'll talk a little bit
more about it in a second.

213
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,840
You can really just edit the
page, go to the bottom of the

214
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,850
page and type in a little
bit of information

215
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,060
about what you edited.

216
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,210
If it's just a typo,
that could be

217
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,020
summarized as a minor edit.

218
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,750
But if you added a new
paragraph, you can describe

219
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,860
what you've done for the logs
later and then save it.

220
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,980
And that's done.

221
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,460
Your documentation is now
live on the internet.

222
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,220
You've seen, as I scroll down
this page, there's a ton of

223
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,890
other information.

224
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,990
I want to ask Alex, who has been
instrumental in creating

225
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,560
some of these templates,
to talk a little

226
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,755
bit more about that.

227
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,440
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So you'll notice
that on these pages,

228
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,630
you might be expecting just
one big text box.

229
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,060
But actually, you see here,
we've got form fields that are

230
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,040
broken out and more
structured.

231
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,480
So what we've done is we've
created for different article

232
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,650
types &mdash; so for CSS property
or tutorial, any number of

233
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,860
different article types, we
create a form that helps

234
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,170
organize that information.

235
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:50,800
We aren't done yet.

236
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,660
Some of them need
some more help.

237
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,740
But you can see here, this is a
great example where it makes

238
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,530
it more clear where to fill
in the information.

239
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,140
One thing to call out as well
on this page is we had this

240
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,350
notion of flags.

241
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,030
So we know the content
isn't perfect yet.

242
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,450
It's in a very early state, and
we need everyone's help to

243
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,830
help massage it, make it more
complete and comprehensive.

244
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,610
So we have this notion of flags
where you can say, this

245
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,510
article is not complete, or this
article has errors, or

246
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,310
this article needs
a new title.

247
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,750
You can flag these off.

248
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,700
If you've noticed a problem, and
you don't want to fix it,

249
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,640
you can go in, hit Edit, check
off these boxes up here &mdash; you

250
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,760
can see them, they're
called high-level

251
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,430
issues in content there &mdash;

252
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,310
and say, well, this
article is a stub.

253
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,150
That will flag it.

254
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,330
So if you go look at the page,
you'll a red bar at the top

255
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,580
that this article needs
those changes.

256
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,120
And other people can find that
content later and say, I'm in

257
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,330
the mood to fix stubs and find a
list of stubs and go and fix

258
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,630
them and remove that flag.

259
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,040
PETER LUBBERS: That's really
powerful because what we want

260
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,280
it to do is for the community
to help, it needs

261
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,800
to be pretty clear &mdash;

262
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,230
ALEX KOMOROSKE: How.

263
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,430
PETER LUBBERS: --how
you can do it.

264
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:58,790
ALEX KOMOROSKE: What
you do, right?

265
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,480
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

266
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,460
So we've actually broken that
down into three different

267
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,718
areas, so five-minutes tasks &mdash;

268
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:08,200
[AUDIO LOST]

269
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:37,650

270
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,770
PETER LUBBERS: --you
would uncheck the

271
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,350
compatibility needed.

272
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,680
So we want to make it really
easy to get started.

273
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,770
You really don't need to be
super technical to be part of

274
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,510
this project.

275
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,420
Everyone can help.

276
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,570
All you need to do is just
sign up at the top.

277
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,290
You get an account, and
you're rolling.

278
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:55,590
SCOTT ROWE: That's it.

279
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,790
If you want to test
code, there's code

280
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,850
there to test, too.

281
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,745
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's
addictive, really.

282
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,050
You start off, you're correcting
a few typos.

283
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,770
You're just doing these very
tactical things that take a

284
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,800
couple of minutes.

285
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,690
And then as you get more
confident, as you do it more

286
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,580
often, you take on bigger
and bigger tasks.

287
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,570
That's one of the reasons
we wanted to

288
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,780
organize it this way &mdash;

289
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,030
to help people really get
involved in a way that doesn't

290
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,920
require them to jump
directly into it.

291
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,430
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, it
reminds me, I used to

292
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,270
contribute a little bit
here and there to MDN.

293
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,670
They had a great system like
that, too, where they would

294
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,080
provide these doc sprints.

295
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,700
Later, I'll tell you a little
bit more about some ones that

296
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,190
we have coming up as well.

297
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,910
So these doc sprints where
basically people are online on

298
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,600
IRC channel or actually in a
physical location, and really

299
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,510
just coming out and saying,
OK, what do I need to do?

300
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,820
Here's a list of tasks, and
just go through it.

301
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,860
Like you said, I found
it pretty addictive.

302
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,410
It's really a great
community effort.

303
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,730
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And we already
have the chat channel &mdash;

304
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:50,790
PETER LUBBERS: Right.

305
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,400
ALEX KOMOROSKE: --and the
mailing list as well.

306
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,010
There's lots of active
discussion on the IRC channel

307
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,130
about people like, hey,
how do I fix this?

308
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,850
It's a great place to find
other people to help you

309
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,940
figure out how to fix things.

310
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,780
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

311
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,200
So on the Getting Started page,
there is in fact some

312
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,390
information about how you
can get connected.

313
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,140
So there's an IRC channel,
a mailing list.

314
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,250
All of that's there.

315
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,780
Just take a look at that
Getting Started page.

316
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:18,220
I wanted to go through the Q&A.
On our Google Developers

317
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,620
Live page, we have a moderator,
and we have a

318
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,190
couple of questions.

319
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,800
So let's take some of those.

320
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,490
Some of them will
be pretty quick.

321
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,320
The first question
is from Fernando.

322
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,620
"Will Web Platform Docs hold
WebGL information?"

323
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,470
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's
a great question.

324
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,680
WebGL is an example of a cutting
edge technology that's

325
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,120
only in some browsers
at the moment.

326
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,230
The idea of Web Platform
Docs is to be useful,

327
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,620
comprehensive, practical
documentation for folks.

328
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,740
In fact, we had this notion
of these pillars, these

329
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,490
foundational principles to the
site, which you can see on the

330
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,080
site at wpd:pillars.

331
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,760
And that's part of our goal.

332
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,430
So we want to be inclusive
about this kind of stuff.

333
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,100
If web developers are going to
want to know about these kinds

334
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,865
of topics, they should be
included, just clearly flagged

335
00:15:03,865 --> 00:15:05,570
to make it clear that
you cannot rely on

336
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,820
this in every browser.

337
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,630
This is something maybe that's
not standardized yet, or it's

338
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,750
only in the beginning stages
of standardization, or it's

339
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,070
only in some browsers.

340
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,840
So yes, WebGL, we definitely
want to have documented on

341
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,190
this site as one example
of many other kinds of

342
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:19,880
technologies.

343
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,440
PETER LUBBERS: Just add to
that, if you're a WebGL

344
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,000
expert, please help us
build that content.

345
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,750

346
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,410
I think the reaction to this
project has been so good

347
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,630
because, look, it's out there.

348
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,750
It's free information.

349
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,520
Everyone can join in.

350
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,550
Really the only criticism
you can have is there's

351
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,840
not enough out there.

352
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,090
Well, come and help
us make it better.

353
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,810
I think what you mentioned also
is an important thing.

354
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,320
Because if we get the
documentation about these

355
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,130
standards that are in the early
stages out there more,

356
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,760
then really we can start
seeing it earlier.

357
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,650
We can have more collaboration
about it.

358
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,450
And since it's a cross-vendor
effort, it's going to be

359
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,320
really cool.

360
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,470
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

361
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,610
I'm really excited about that.

362
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,080
PETER LUBBERS: Another
question from Eltern.

363
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,650
"Will Web Platform Docs be
available in other languages?"

364
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,080
The infrastructure is set up
so that, yes, it will be

365
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,560
possible to translate it.

366
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,250
Of course, right
now at launch &mdash;

367
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,100
I think there's actually a
little bit of Spanish content

368
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,640
that I noticed in the Docs &mdash;

369
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,430
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We don't
have a ton of it.

370
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,840
Our intention, of course, is
to have this content be

371
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,600
available in many different
languages.

372
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,230
We looked at a number of
different ways of doing this.

373
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,060
We're still working
on precisely the

374
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,860
final way to do it.

375
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,180
But this is definitely
very important.

376
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,080
I know we've had a number of
folks reach out to us and say,

377
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,010
hey, I really want to translate
this into German.

378
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,790
It's like, cool.

379
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,960
Hold that thought for a second
as we make sure we get this in

380
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,570
place for you to do this.

381
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,130
But we definitely
want to have a

382
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,340
thriving translation community.

383
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,330
PETER LUBBERS: It really comes
back to the point where we

384
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,660
said, we want to get it out in
front of the community sooner

385
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,700
rather than later.

386
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,750
So if that means we don't
have it translated in 32

387
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,109
languages &mdash;

388
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,349
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Not yet.

389
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,920
PETER LUBBERS: --then we'd
rather have it out there and

390
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,802
get the community to
help us build that.

391
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:09,710
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

392
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,770
PETER LUBBERS: Another
question from Serge.

393
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,700
"From the blog post, Web
Platform Docs is the first and

394
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,190
most important piece of
webplatform.org." That's a

395
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:24,300
good question about are there
other parts of the site that

396
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,579
will be created later on?

397
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,790
Do you want to &mdash;

398
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,760
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So right now,
the focus is definitely Docs.

399
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,280
It's primarily documentation.

400
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
That's what we're starting.

401
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,090
But I'm so excited about
webplatform.org because

402
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,810
there's so much more
potential.

403
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,970
There's so many other things.

404
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,090
We're even seeing a little
bit with chat.

405
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,490
The IRC channel already has
all these interesting

406
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,910
discussions going on about not
just the site, but web

407
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,180
development in general.

408
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,610
So you can imagine
webplatform.org growing over

409
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,620
time to include all kinds of
other things that are relevant

410
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,020
to web developers.

411
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,570
We don't know exactly what those
are at this point, but

412
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,680
I'm excited by the possibility
of the community helping us

413
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
figure out what things are going
to be useful and then

414
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,000
doing that on this site.

415
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,710
Webplatform.org is much bigger
than just documentation, which

416
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,190
is already quite big.

417
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,040
It's a very open-ended
sort of promise.

418
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,830
I'm really excited about it.

419
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,680
PETER LUBBERS: So Scott, maybe
you can answer this question.

420
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,370
SCOTT ROWE: I'll do my best.

421
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,190
PETER LUBBERS: Web Platform
being a community, how can I

422
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,150
help out anything other than
contributing content?

423
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,710
SCOTT ROWE: Well, we certainly
have a lot of ways to do that.

424
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,710
You can edit the compatibility
tables.

425
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,260
That requires some research
figuring out what features are

426
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,330
supported in which browsers.

427
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:43,700
There are a number of flags you
can use on content that

428
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:50,770
don't have anything to do with
the editing tasks, flags that

429
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,800
say this content may be
misplaced, or it may be

430
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,400
duplicative or some
such flag as that.

431
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,780
The way we've shown how the
forms are laid out with the

432
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:13,490
different types of information
to supply, those help you get

433
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,690
through that process of
contributing in ways that may

434
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,760
involve editing or may not.

435
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,430
ALEX KOMOROSKE: There's
a lot of other stuff

436
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,990
you can do as well.

437
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,730
As one example, you can look at
the recent changes list on

438
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,530
the site and see changes that
are obviously spam and help

439
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,470
revert those.

440
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,450
You could be someone who just
hangs around the IRC channel

441
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,210
and helps answer people's
questions and

442
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,290
help them get started.

443
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,620
There's all kinds of stuff to
do that doesn't directly

444
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,390
involve editing content, but
really helping foster the

445
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,610
community and be
a part of that.

446
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,780
PETER LUBBERS: Fantastic.

447
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,920
Another question from Serge &mdash;

448
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,725
good questions from
Serge here.

449
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:51,040
"Will there be video content
on the site?"

450
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,550
Sorry, actually this
is from Eliah.

451
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,810
"Will it be accepted,
endorsed, and

452
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,790
promoted on the platform?

453
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,880
So video tutorials,
for example.

454
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,360
I think the answer is yes.

455
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,380
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I believe
so as well.

456
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,560
We can't speak on behalf of
everybody, the whole community

457
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,940
obviously, but that sounds
great to me.

458
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,140
I think this is the perfect
thing to bring up on the

459
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,710
mailing list or on the IRC
channel and discuss with the

460
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,310
rest of the community.

461
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,800
But this totally fits in with
the mission of the site, so &mdash;

462
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,840
PETER LUBBERS: Definitely, I
would expect to see that.

463
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,640
All right.

464
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,300
"What is the planned
scope for Docs?

465
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,350
Are server-side technologies
like PHP and Ruby going to be

466
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,560
added?"

467
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,970
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So when I was
hanging out in the IRC channel

468
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,040
a lot yesterday and today, this
question's come up a lot.

469
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,500
At the beginning &mdash;

470
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,660
again, I can't speak on behalf
of the entire community,. and

471
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,245
it's up to us as a community to
figure out what the answer

472
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:41,430
to this question is.

473
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,910
We were focusing at the
beginning especially on

474
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,580
client-side technologies,
so technologies that are

475
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,920
implemented in a browser, say.

476
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,260
However, there's all kinds of
documentation that's relevant

477
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,230
to web developers that's
not just based

478
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,440
on what's in a browser.

479
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,730
I think over time, as we see
what's most useful for the

480
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,220
community, that may be the
stuff that's involved in.

481
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,090
At the beginning, you can
imagine just a simple page

482
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,440
that points you in the
direction of other

483
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,320
documentation sites.

484
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,930
But definitely, this is
something that people are

485
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,900
interested in.

486
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,450
It will be hard to do correctly
because there are so

487
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,290
many different things to
include, but I think this is a

488
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,210
great example of where the
community can help us set the

489
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,600
direction for this
site long term.

490
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,060
PETER LUBBERS: Perfect.

491
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,650
Another question here. "How long
until the alpha ends and

492
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:33,130
what about beta?"
We don't have &mdash;

493
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,840
ALEX KOMOROSKE: The way I would
describe it is we're

494
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,880
using the word "alpha" to
communicate to people that

495
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,710
this site is very early.

496
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,350
We've seeded it with a lot of
great content, but there is so

497
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,000
much longer to go before the
site has become the definitive

498
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,800
piece, the site for
documentation for web

499
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,970
developers.

500
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,380
So when we drop that label, when
it becomes a stable, or

501
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,010
beta, I don't think anyone
knows at this point.

502
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,080
It really depends on how much
the community can come

503
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,170
together to bring the site up
to the level of quality that

504
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,460
we all want it to be.

505
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,580
That is definitely our goal.

506
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,000
Our goal is to get this to be
the definitive source of web

507
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,030
developer documentation.

508
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,050
When we're to that point, when
we as a community feel

509
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,570
comfortable with that, I can
imagine that we drop that

510
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,710
alpha bit from the label.

511
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,110
PETER LUBBERS: So to
be determined.

512
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,990
Jerome in Toronto asked "what
happens to existing

513
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,650
documentation on the web?

514
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,170
With Web Platform Docs, we now
have duplicate and redundant

515
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,420
documentation.

516
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,540

517
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,740
How do I deal with that?"

518
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,660
SCOTT ROWE: That's the current
state of affairs.

519
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,260
There is a lot of duplicative
content.

520
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,800
What we hope to do over time
is to gradually funnel that

521
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,150
into fewer and fewer sources
for people to go to so it

522
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,020
isn't quite so hard
to find things.

523
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,270
That's the purpose of
webplatform.org.

524
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,750
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We can't
speak on behalf of

525
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,220
various other sites.

526
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,330
Our hope is that by fostering
this community as a central

527
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,960
place that people can that, that
everyone can come to and

528
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,460
centralize around, that
naturally over time &mdash;

529
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,320
yes, right now, there's
duplicated content on

530
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,050
different sites.

531
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,510
But quite frankly, that's
been the case for a

532
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,610
long time as well.

533
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,290
There are many great sites that
effectively duplicate

534
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,910
content across different
sites.

535
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,130
Our hope is that this Web
Platform Docs can, long term,

536
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,300
become the comprehensive
answer where, this

537
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,870
is where you go.

538
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,290
This is where the content
goes as well.

539
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,750
In the short term, of course,
it's very early.

540
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,540
There's still lots of other
sources of content.

541
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,990
PETER LUBBERS: And like I said
earlier on, the biggest

542
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,330
feature here is that you
can edit this content.

543
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,090
It's very easy to come across
outdated content.

544
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,390
I've written a lot of articles
myself, and then two years

545
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,880
later, somebody will post on a
blog like, oh, this is so bad,

546
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,660
this information.

547
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,560
Sure, but it hasn't
been updated.

548
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,290
It was accurate at the time.

549
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,240
Especially with these evolving
technologies,

550
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,420
that's a real problem.

551
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,430
This stuff happens so fast that
it's almost impossible to

552
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,822
keep up with as a single person
or a single site.

553
00:23:54,822 --> 00:23:56,900
SCOTT ROWE: It's going
to take a village.

554
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,840
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

555
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,440
A web village.

556
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,210
OK, so one other question
here from Morgan.

557
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,840
"How should compatibility
tables be formatted?

558
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,290
Should they list all versions or
the first version where you

559
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,080
can use an element
or attribute?"

560
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,410
ALEX KOMOROSKE: This is a very
low-level question, but one

561
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,660
that's near and dear to my
heart because I wrote the

562
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,460
original template that we're
using right now for the

563
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,870
compatibility tables.

564
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,330
Compatibility is a very
interesting question because

565
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,670
there's lots of different ways
to present the information

566
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,890
that are useful to people
in different contexts.

567
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,700
I don't think that we have
the answer right now.

568
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,020
I think we've got a pretty good
stab at the beginning.

569
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,350
But this is the kind of thing
that we really want to dive

570
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,010
into with the community and help
figure out what is the

571
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,840
right way to present
this content?

572
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,370
So right now, what you do is you
create a new row for each

573
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,560
new sub-piece of support.

574
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,160
So the first row is
basic support.

575
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,210
You might have, say,
box shadow.

576
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,060
Whether or not you support
the insect keyword is a

577
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,270
sub-feature of that thing, so
that would have its own row.

578
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,940
Ideally, we would have the first
version number of each

579
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,740
browser that started
supporting it.

580
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,450
One other thing, too, that's
important is we have this

581
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,700
notion of compatibility notes.

582
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,370
That's a table after the
compatibility table that says,

583
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,950
hey, just FYI, in Chrome Version
12, there was this

584
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,040
weird little hack, a tweak
that didn't work exactly

585
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,350
correctly, so that you still
have this historical record

586
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,700
for people who do need to figure
out how precisely it

587
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,590
differed in other places.

588
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,130
But I'm really looking forward
to working with folks to

589
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,110
figure out what the right
format is for this.

590
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,720
There's a lot of different
formats out there for this

591
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,230
information.

592
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,680
SCOTT ROWE: You can also can
tag content that is &mdash;

593
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,410
you can set up the compatibility
table to show

594
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:43,950
that when a feature was
supported as prefixed and when

595
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,830
it was supported
without prefix.

596
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:53,480
So the question is, well, from
which version onward?

597
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,950
And how do I show that in
the compatibility table?

598
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:01,270
The method we've been adopting
is the first version of its

599
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,920
support is the first version
that you cite.

600
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,440
And thereafter, it's assumed
to be supported.

601
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,850
If, however, a subsequent
version is a non-prefixed

602
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:19,140
version, then you have a
different tag to apply there.

603
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,530
So maybe we need a tutorial
about using that.

604
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,830

605
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,720
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's easy to
test and see, hey, does this

606
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,980
browser support this
functionality?

607
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,650
But you might not know when it
started because it's back in

608
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,420
the mists of time.

609
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,080
PETER LUBBERS: True.

610
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,920
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So what we've
done in the current template

611
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,260
is it's possible to say,
I know it's supported.

612
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,550
I don't know when it started.

613
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,650
And if you want, you can also
fill in more specific

614
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,800
information and say, oh,
I know it was supported

615
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,970
as of Version 7.

616
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,490
But there's a lot of room to
grow here and to explore

617
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,810
different options here.

618
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,320
PETER LUBBERS: Great.

619
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,710
So I think that gives a
pretty good overview.

620
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,940
We've answered all
the questions.

621
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,350
We'll come back and we'll make
another pass through just in

622
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,250
case we missed any.

623
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,650
The final thing that I wanted to
talk a little bit about is

624
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,280
the way you can get started
in the community.

625
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,790
So of course, we have
the home page.

626
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,560
There's some links to the
Getting Started document.

627
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,990
We're also planning a bunch
of doc sprints.

628
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,750
The first one, actually &mdash;

629
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,390
shameless plug for the San
Francisco HTML5 user group

630
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,160
that I run.

631
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,070
We actually have an event
next week that will be

632
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,280
live-streamed from San Francisco
talking about web

633
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,450
standards and also on how
to help on this project.

634
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,970
And after that, we're announcing
for November 3 with

635
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,930
Adobe, we're launching the first
doc spring This is an

636
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,730
on-site doc sprint.

637
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,710
But, of course we'll open it
up to anyone that wants to

638
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,920
join online.

639
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,200
So it's going to be
pretty exciting.

640
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,040
We're just going to get in the
room for a day and start going

641
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,480
through issues.

642
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,680
Like I said, we have five-minute
tasks, half-hour

643
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,830
tasks, and then the slightly
longer ones.

644
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,690
Hopefully, get a bunch of
those out of the way.

645
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,030
So anything &mdash;

646
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,620
ALEX KOMOROSKE: There's a list
of those on the site as well.

647
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,210
PETER LUBBERS: That's right.

648
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,230
ALEX KOMOROSKE: One thing I
wanted to emphasize, too, is

649
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,430
there are people who are
organizing these events like

650
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,930
Adobe and Peter and others.

651
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,090
But really, we want to encourage
you guys to create

652
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:14,850
your own as well.

653
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,910
You don't have to wait for one
of the stewards or something

654
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,470
to do this.

655
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,170
This is something where if you
want to just grab a few people

656
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,090
in your hometown or whatever
and work on it together,

657
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,550
that's great.

658
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,390
Let us know on the IRC channels
so we can make sure

659
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,050
we're around to support
you guys.

660
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,540
We want everyone in the
community to feel the ability

661
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,582
to get this stuff started.

662
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,520
PETER LUBBERS: That's
a very good point.

663
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,110
Of course, we're going to
share the pros and cons,

664
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,640
everything we've done and the
things that went well and the

665
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,820
things that didn't go well.

666
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,430
But everyone should
be able to &mdash;

667
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,505
we shouldn't have to wait until
the third of November to

668
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:54,400
start helping, definitely.

669
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,150
Well, with that, I think we're
going to close it for today.

670
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,810
Thanks for joining us.

671
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,450
The recording of this session
will be available at the same

672
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,740
URL in a few minutes so you
can point people to that.

673
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,680
Hopefully, we'll see you online
in the IRC channel

674
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,490
helping out on Web
Platform Docs.

675
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,620
Thanks so much.

676
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:24,000
