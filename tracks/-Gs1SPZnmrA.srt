1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,288

2
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:28,530
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

3
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,600
interesting developer community.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,430
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

5
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,460
has asked this question.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,800
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,072
FEMALE SPEAKER: This
is primarily a

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,660
question-and-answer show.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,050
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions &mdash;

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:48,163

11
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:49,040
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,870
Well, welcome.

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,960
Hey.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,770
So I'm Pete LePage and welcome
to the first of a series of

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,230
Chrome Mobile Hangouts.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,440
With me here, we've got Boris.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,560
I'll let you introduce
yourself.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,080
BORIS SMUS: Hey, I'm Boris.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,160
We're both from Chrome Developer
Relations, so mostly

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,340
working on mobile these days.

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,280
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,650
So back at Google I/O, Chrome
for Android and Chrome for iOS

23
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,140
became available.

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,620
And we're really excited about
both of those, because it

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,840
really brings a great browser
to the mobile environments.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,730
So today, we want to talk about
a couple of things that

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,690
we think is pretty
interesting.

28
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,000
Boris is going to start off
talking a little bit about

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,470
high DPI stuff.

30
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,640
So if you've been building web
applications or websites, and

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,480
you've used them on either one
of the new MacBooks that have

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,400
Retina display or on a
iPad3, you've seen

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,730
the high DPI stuff.

34
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,320
And the web looks a little bit
different if you're using one

35
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,400
of those devices than
something else.

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,440
And then I'm going to talk a
little bit about some of the

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,010
debugging tools that you can use
on Chrome for Android when

38
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,290
building these sites.

39
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,090
And then we'll take
some of your

40
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,500
questions through the moderator.

41
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,240
So Boris, I'll pass
it over to you.

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,690
You just had an article
about high DPI &mdash;

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,870
BORIS SMUS: We published
an article this

44
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,450
morning, "HTML5 Rocks".

45
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,380
Many thanks to Alex who
stayed up late in

46
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,440
Sydney to get that out.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,870
So I just want to sort of
be more specific here.

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,400
The high DPI problem doesn't
just apply to iPads and

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,330
MacBook Pros with the
new Retina displays.

50
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,010
It's actually a general
problem on the web.

51
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,640
There's a lot of devices that
now have device pixel ratios

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,420
of greater than one.

53
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,720
I'll talk a little bit
more about what

54
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,880
that means in a second.

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,070
But it's an Android issue.

56
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,310
It's a Windows Phone 8 issue.

57
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,500
And it's an iPhone issue
and iPad issue.

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,770
So this high DPI question needs
to be solved generally

59
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,620
on the web and is being
worked on generally.

60
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,800
So there's this big thing about
Retina displays, but

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,780
that's just branding.

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,070
Right?

63
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,090
PETE LEPAGE: Ah, OK.

64
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,420
And it's also more than just,
OK, say, I've got this high

65
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,760
DPI image or a regular, but
there's also something about

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,900
choosing images based on screen
size too in there.

67
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,420
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

68
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,040
It gets a little complicated,
actually.

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,710

70
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,490
Well, basically what you want to
do is you want to serve the

71
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,590
best quality image as
quickly as possible.

72
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,405
But the thing is what quality
means sort of depends.

73
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,780
Right?

74
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,770
You have like just pure
resolution, like crispness of

75
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,800
the pixels.

76
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,180
And then you have things like
for a small display, you want

77
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,160
to show up maybe a different
image than for large display.

78
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,490
Like say you have Obama speaking
at some conference or

79
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,810
something like that, maybe if
you have a large screen,

80
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,220
you'll show the pedestal,
you'll show

81
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,800
Obama's face as well.

82
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,840
But on a small screen, you
might just show his face,

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,890
because there's not
much real estate.

84
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,550
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

85
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,220
I think in your article that
was just published &mdash;

86
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,060
and we can put the
link up for that.

87
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,810
But in that article, if you
scroll down, you actually have

88
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,690
a really good visual description
of that, where in

89
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,090
the foreground, you've got like
person and all of the

90
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,160
background image, like where
they're standing, where

91
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,400
they're talking.

92
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,750
But on a small screen
display, that person

93
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,560
just gets lost, right?

94
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,300
And you don't want to
show all of that.

95
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,730
BORIS SMUS: Right.

96
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,360
I actually don't have
that in the article.

97
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,400
But the article more focuses
on just the resolution.

98
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,640
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, OK.

99
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,399
I might be thinking of a &mdash;

100
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:21,970
BORIS SMUS: That was
something else.

101
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,840
PETE LEPAGE: --different
article.

102
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,280
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,840
Another article, I'm
sure, had that.

104
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,250
I know the exact image,
actually,

105
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,680
you're talking about.

106
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,920
But anyway, the way this whole
resolution aspect works, if

107
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,920
you ignore the art direction
of bits, it's sort of

108
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,230
complicated on the web, because
there's so many

109
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,000
different kinds of browsers
out there and so many

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,220
different devices.

111
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,430
Like on iOS, for example, you
just have 1x and 2x displays.

112
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,130
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

113
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,960
So when you're talking
about 1x and 2x,

114
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,970
what does that mean?

115
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,460
Can you &mdash;

116
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,260
BORIS SMUS: Sure.

117
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,730
So basically a 1x image &mdash;

118
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,330
well, let's talk about
displays first.

119
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,220
A 1x display has
pixel density.

120
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,630
That's whatever the display's
pixel density is.

121
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,110
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

122
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,680
So if I've got &mdash;

123
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,700
BORIS SMUS: For an iPhone, the
pixel density of the iPhone

124
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:23,150
3G, the pre-4 one, is
like 163, actually.

125
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,980
PETE LEPAGE: So that's
the pixel density.

126
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,400
So like in one inch, there's
about 163 pixels.

127
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,210
BORIS SMUS: Exactly 163.

128
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,170
Well, about on average.

129
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,890
So with a 2x display, there's
twice as many pixels in the

130
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,660
same space.

131
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,330
PETE LEPAGE: So roughly,
there's like 320

132
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:42,590
pixels in an inch.

133
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,090
BORIS SMUS: 326.

134
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,160
So that's the 2x display
of a iPhone.

135
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,260
Of course, the actual number of
pixels depends on what the

136
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,020
initial 1x was.

137
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,790
So like an iPad is slightly
less dense.

138
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,920
A MacBook Pro is even
less dense.

139
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,905
But the 2x equivalents
are doubled.

140
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:03,940
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

141
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,510
All right.

142
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,450
BORIS SMUS: So that's the
way that that works.

143
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,030
It makes it really simple
for Apple developers

144
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,050
to solve this problem.

145
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,990
Android also has a
similar concept.

146
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,250
But because of the variable
display densities,

147
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,950
there's no 2x notion.

148
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,385
So you sort of need to cover
the whole gamut of

149
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:24,890
possibilities.

150
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,500
PETE LEPAGE: So does that mean
that like it might be 1.5, or

151
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,155
1.3, or 1. &mdash;

152
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:30,840
BORIS SMUS: Exactly.

153
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,250
PETE LEPAGE: It could be
anywhere in that number.

154
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,300
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

155
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,720
I mean we're probably going to
start seeing greater than 2x

156
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,850
as well going forward from &mdash;
well, maybe not from Apple.

157
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,120
I can't speculate there.

158
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,310
But it's certainly likely to
increase up to the point where

159
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,040
you can't see any
pixels anymore.

160
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,020
PETE LEPAGE: That would
be really cool.

161
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,970
That would be really neat.

162
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,220
BORIS SMUS: We're getting
close already.

163
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,430

164
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,460
You have to look really
hard to find them.

165
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,610
So that's sort of the story.

166
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,520
Android solves the problem by
letting you provide like four

167
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,220
different images.

168
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,030
So you have a very small,
medium, biggish, and extra,

169
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,480
extra large &mdash;

170
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,030
PETE LEPAGE: Now this is if
you're doing an Android native

171
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,865
application.

172
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:18,273
So that doesn't really apply
for web developers.

173
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:19,340
BORIS SMUS: No.

174
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,250
I'm trying to set
the stage here.

175
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,030
And on the web, the whole
problem reduces

176
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,050
to CSS scaled pixels.

177
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,410
So the way that works is
essentially the spec provides

178
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,820
an angular size.

179
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,020
The spec defines pixels
to be an angular unit.

180
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,830
It's a little confusing.

181
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,920
But you should read
the article.

182
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,000
I think it explains
it pretty well.

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,420
The basic idea though is a
pixel is a certain angle.

184
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,935
So depending on how
close or how far &mdash;

185
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:52,750
PETE LEPAGE: Oh.

186
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,210
When I read it, I was trying to
figure out, OK, an angle to

187
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,310
me is sort of this way.

188
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,050
But it's more the angle
this way coming out of

189
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,110
the screen at you.

190
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,705
BORIS SMUS: No, it's your
viewing angle actually, not

191
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:02,720
the screen.

192
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,910
So if the screen is in front of
me, then I have a certain

193
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,620
viewing angle.

194
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,570
And what this means is basically
the pixels' physical

195
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,560
size depends on how far the
screen is from me, So this is

196
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,502
the spec definition.

197
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:20,320
PETE LEPAGE: Now, this gets kind
of confusing and a pain

198
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,790
for developers.

199
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,410
BORIS SMUS: Sort of.

200
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,330
I think in practice,
it's a lot simpler.

201
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:25,960
PETE LEPAGE: Good.

202
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,220
BORIS SMUS: So the way this
works, the specs sets this

203
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,740
angular pixel.

204
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,260
And then a browser vendor can
assign the device pixel ratio,

205
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,659
which scales virtual pixels
into this physical pixel.

206
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,340
So essentially, what device
pixel ratio does is it scales

207
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,800
every CSS pixel to the
physical size.

208
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,520
And at that point, you basically
don't even need to

209
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,040
know what the spec says.

210
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,350
PETE LEPAGE: I like that because
this is sounding more

211
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,980
complex than I think
it should be.

212
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,675
BORIS SMUS: Right.

213
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,910
But with device pixel ratio, you
kind of abstract yourself

214
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,810
from the gory details of the
spec, which I go into if

215
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,580
you're interested.

216
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,730
Take a look at the article.

217
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,630
There's even a little diagram
to illustrate that.

218
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:17,550
But yeah, basically, the
pixels are scaled.

219
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,080
But you still have
the problem of &mdash;

220
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,190
essentially, if you're scaling
pixels, then your images are

221
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,040
being scaled.

222
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,570
And if you scale images to be
large, then suddenly you have

223
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,980
really crappy-looking &mdash;

224
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,010
PETE LEPAGE: Lower quality.

225
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,800
BORIS SMUS: --lower
quality images.

226
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,530
So the question then is
how do you serve the

227
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,070
right size of image?

228
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,960
And there's many ways.

229
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,340
I mean, one solution is you
just serve high DPI images

230
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,060
everywhere.

231
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,640
PETE LEPAGE: And that's
fantastic for anybody who's on

232
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,460
a high-speed, dedicated internet
connection who

233
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,650
doesn't care about their
bandwidth, which is probably

234
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,070
not everybody.

235
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,740
In fact, I'd guarantee
it's not everybody.

236
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,130
BORIS SMUS: Especially on
Mobile, things are really &mdash;

237
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,920
well, you have slow speeds.

238
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,100
You have very high latency,
generally, from 3G

239
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,370
connections, even
4G connections.

240
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,320
Essentially, latency isn't
really changing, because it's

241
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,145
constrained by distance
from cell tower.

242
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:15,840
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

243
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,123
So the further I am from the
cell tower, the longer it's

244
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:19,750
going to take for the radio
signal to come.

245
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,030
So it doesn't matter how fast
I can get everything, it's

246
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,466
still going to take a little
bit of time for the &mdash;

247
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:28,150
BORIS SMUS: So there's all
these sort of different

248
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,330
constraints in mobile.

249
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,740
So anyway, there's multiple
solutions.

250
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,550
You can do this in JavaScript.

251
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,750
And there's a whole spreadsheet
that someone put

252
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,245
together of all the
JavaScript &mdash;

253
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:43,266
PETE LEPAGE: Libraries.

254
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:48,640
BORIS SMUS: --Image solutions,
OK high DPI image solutions.

255
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,920
And there's like at least 30.

256
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,370
So it's pretty impressive.

257
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,550
There's also CSS approaches.

258
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,280
So with CSS media queries, what
you can do now is you can

259
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,320
select the proper image.

260
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,920
Well, essentially what you
do is you set a media

261
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,576
query based on the &mdash;

262
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,390
PETE LEPAGE: It's the
device pixel.

263
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,380
BORIS SMUS: Device DPI.

264
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,110
PETE LEPAGE: Device
DPI or pixel &mdash;

265
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,050
BORIS SMUS: Device
pixel ratio.

266
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,790
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

267
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,870
So like at the top, I'd say,
hey, here's my CSS, and I

268
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,290
specify media query in there.

269
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,550
And I said device pixel ratio
of between 1.0 and 1.5.

270
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,360
And I might do another one
for 1.5 to bigger.

271
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,430
And that would give
me the high ones.

272
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,190
BORIS SMUS: Exactly.

273
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,400
PETE LEPAGE: Now, that's only
going to do images if they're

274
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,310
in a background, for my style
sheet, or if they're maybe

275
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,240
specified as a background
on a div or

276
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,010
something like that, right?

277
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,750
BORIS SMUS: Exactly.

278
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,390
So with media queries, you're
constrained to CSS properties

279
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,770
and not content images.

280
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,350
So you can't set the image
source with a media query.

281
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,780
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

282
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,400
So I can't use that for,
say, hey, I want to

283
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,350
put an image here.

284
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,390
And this is my image of
a newspaper article or

285
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,310
something like that.

286
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,770
BORIS SMUS: You sort of can.

287
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:06,360
I mean, you can just create a
div, set the background image,

288
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,800
and pretend it was
a content image.

289
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,410
And like you can even say &mdash;

290
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,120
PETE LEPAGE: Then I would have
to generate that CSS every

291
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,565
time, depending on if the
image is dynamic.

292
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:18,880
So I'm thinking like
a news website or

293
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,600
something like that.

294
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,210
If the image is dynamic, I'm
going to have to do that.

295
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,810
BORIS SMUS: You can still
do that with JavaScript.

296
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,400
It's not a problem.

297
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,655
PETE LEPAGE: Oh yeah,
that's a fair point.

298
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,005
That's a good point.

299
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:32,800
BORIS SMUS: I mean, you can
set the background images

300
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,200
dynamically.

301
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,660
Anyway, so there's
JavaScript, CSS.

302
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,090
You can do this on
a server as well.

303
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,860

304
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,000
So just using the user agent,
which is all we have on the

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,545
server, unfortunately, you
simply just serve the high DPI

306
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:49,160
image if necessary.

307
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,860
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

308
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,960
So you could say, oh, this
particular device, I know is a

309
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,710
high DPI device, so I want to
serve the high DPI image.

310
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,250
Now, that's going to
work great for a

311
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,660
known set of devices.

312
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,170
But like, say, for example, some
brand new company goes

313
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,590
and ships the new, coolest
tablet ever.

314
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,590
And it's got a device
pixel ratio of four.

315
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,755
On day one, I'm probably
screwed.

316
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,340
BORIS SMUS: Well, you're not
screwed in the sense of &mdash;

317
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,650
PETE LEPAGE: If I use the
server side, and I

318
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,340
don't know about it.

319
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,150
BORIS SMUS: Sure.

320
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,540
If you're using the server side
and doing like a robust

321
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,140
solution, you're probably using
a device database, like

322
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,100
[INAUDIBLE] or &mdash;

323
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,030
what's the other one &mdash;

324
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,140
Device Atlas, one of those.

325
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,490
So there, you would just
update your database.

326
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,810
And hopefully, they
would be able to &mdash;

327
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,390
PETE LEPAGE: They'll
provide that info.

328
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,280
BORIS SMUS: But you know, that's
sort of theoretical.

329
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,080
There's definitely drawbacks.

330
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,970
And you'll need a custom
server solution

331
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,050
to do this, et cetera.

332
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,320
So the real solution to this
problem is to use things that

333
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,600
are built into the browser.

334
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,695
PETE LEPAGE: That's pretty
much always a

335
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:58,520
safe thing to do.

336
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,540
BORIS SMUS: Because
there's drawbacks

337
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,690
to every other approach.

338
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,480
And of course, the drawback here
is it's not implemented

339
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,796
everywhere.

340
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:06,380
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

341
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,630
These are specs that
are still sort of &mdash;

342
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,570
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

343
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,430
PETE LEPAGE: Would you call
them release candidate?

344
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,840
Or are we still sort of &mdash;

345
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,090
BORIS SMUS: It's hard to
speculate about that.

346
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:23,830
I mean, they're both specs that
are somewhat in progress.

347
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,950
But certainly, we will have some
image selection, image

348
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,900
set approach for both content
images, like setting image

349
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,670
source, and for background
images.

350
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,460
So the way with background
images right now,

351
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,460
it's with image set.

352
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,250
And I talk about it in some
detail in my article.

353
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,290
But essentially, what you're
saying is you specify multiple

354
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,310
images, and you say what
the [? x-ity ?]

355
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,910
is, like 1x, 1.5x, et cetera.

356
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,980
PETE LEPAGE: So the device
pixel ratio, you

357
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,940
say one point whatever.

358
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,590
BORIS SMUS: So you provide
multiple of these images.

359
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,690
And then the browser selects
which one to load for you.

360
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,990
PETE LEPAGE: So the browser is
smart enough to go, oh OK, we

361
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,965
want to grab this.

362
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:09,570
BORIS SMUS: And it's
more of a guide.

363
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,440
So one of the drawbacks with
CSS using media queries is

364
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,650
your device pixel ratio may be
two, but you may be on a very

365
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,490
slow link, for example.

366
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,260
Then you're downloading a huge
image on like your EDGE

367
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,140
connection, and that's a
bad user experience.

368
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,565
So if the browser can make
that call for you &mdash;

369
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:30,630
PETE LEPAGE: We definitely want
the browser to do that.

370
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,360
BORIS SMUS: We want
to do that.

371
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,690
So I think that's the main
benefit of building it

372
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,700
directly into the browser.

373
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,170
So it's image set for CSS.

374
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,630
PETE LEPAGE: So that's
image set.

375
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,890
So I would say image colon and
then like provide a set?

376
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,900
I guess it's in the article.

377
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,780
BORIS SMUS: It's
in the article.

378
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,100
But it's essentially a
custom CSS function.

379
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,150
with its own syntax,
et cetera.

380
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:01,850
And right now, it's in WebKit
only, so prefix with the dash

381
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,200
WebKit prefix.

382
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:11,070
And it's available in Safari
6 and Chrome, I think.

383
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,850
[INAUDIBLE]

384
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,030
the Canary.

385
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,120
PETE LEPAGE: So it's not
available, say, on Chrome for

386
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,030
Android yet?

387
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,580
BORIS SMUS: Not yet.

388
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,640
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

389
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,590
But something that &mdash;

390
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,170
BORIS SMUS: But it will be.

391
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,190
PETE LEPAGE: --we hope to see
coming in the near future.

392
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,770
BORIS SMUS: And I believe
it may be &mdash;

393
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,420
well, it's likely to be in the
next versions of both Chrome

394
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,790
for Android and probably
Mobile Safari as well.

395
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,510
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

396
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,890
So we should keep an
eye out for that.

397
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,420
Hopefully, it'll be in
the next version.

398
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,360
BORIS SMUS: And of course, for
content images, we have a

399
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,790
similar thing called
source set.

400
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,280
So you have image source, and
you have image source set.

401
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,340
PETE LEPAGE: So I'd say image
source, and then I;d provide

402
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,440
the normal one so that legacy
browers or normal browsers

403
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,250
will just pick that up.

404
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,315
But then I'd say source set &mdash;

405
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:54,130
BORIS SMUS: Source set.

406
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,390
Yeah.

407
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,960
PETE LEPAGE: --and that's still
an attribute within the

408
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,970
image element, right?

409
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,140
BORIS SMUS: Exactly.

410
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:05,890
So it's sort of a little more
complex than image set, the

411
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,310
CSS version.

412
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,540
And you can specify additional
things like width and height

413
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,280
of the view port.

414
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,920
So again, this gets a little
more complicated.

415
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,510
And in my personal opinion, both
image set and source set

416
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,869
should have the same syntax.

417
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:26,170
They currently don't.

418
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,210
The other thing to know is
a source set is it's not

419
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,280
available anywhere.

420
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,630
There's no implementation.

421
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,430
PETE LEPAGE: Ah.

422
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,720
All right.

423
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,990
So it's cool, but we
can't use it yet.

424
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,090
BORIS SMUS: It's cool, and we
can use it with a polyfill

425
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,470
that I wrote.

426
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,670
But it's not available
in any browser.

427
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,960
So I would say it's far less
mature than image set and

428
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,740
likely to change more as well.

429
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,300
PETE LEPAGE: So the
link to your

430
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,380
polyfill is in that article.

431
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,140
So if people, go have a look at
that article, they can get

432
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,865
that link, correct?

433
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:59,050
BORIS SMUS: Correct.

434
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,590
So anyway, take a look
at the article.

435
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,330
Try the polyfill.

436
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,580
Let me know what you think.

437
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,180

438
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,770
PETE LEPAGE: So what
would you say &mdash;

439
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,180
I want to go, I want to make
my website work best now.

440
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,220
What's the best thing I can
do to make sure that I'm

441
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,740
providing the best experience?

442
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,120
BORIS SMUS: The best thing you
can do now sort of depends on

443
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,550
what your target is, who your
clients are, et cetera.

444
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,330
If you're targeting legacy
browsers, you probably want to

445
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,520
use something less ambitious
than image set and source set,

446
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,780
because you're just going to
end up having to polyfill

447
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,040
everything right.

448
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,180
So if you're doing that, fall
back to JavaScript, see if

449
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:45,200
media queries are supported, do
something less ambitious.

450
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
However, if you're on
the bleeding edge &mdash;

451
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,695
PETE LEPAGE: If you want to be
sort of on the cutting edge &mdash;

452
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,550
BORIS SMUS: --you should
probably be using image set

453
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,800
and source set.

454
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,552

455
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:58,390
Definitely image set, maybe
not source set.

456
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,950
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

457
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,280
All right.

458
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,060
Well, hopefully that's
a good intro to this.

459
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,650
This is something, I think,
it's a little bit

460
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,740
complex right now.

461
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,610
It's a little bit more fun than
it should be, and fun is

462
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:17,600
a subjective thing, but will
become easier in the future.

463
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,340
This is something that I think
a lot of browser vendors are

464
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,480
looking at and trying
to figure out.

465
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,590
Because we really want to make
sure that it's easy for you.

466
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,140
And as developers, it should
be mostly transparent.

467
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,450
It should be something that you
go, all right, here's my

468
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,790
image, and maybe I need
a high DPI or low.

469
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,160
Actually, you know one that you
didn't mention, I can't

470
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,440
remember if you mentioned
it in your

471
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,510
article, but image formats.

472
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,450
There are some image formats
that provides that.

473
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,115
But it doesn't stop downloading
once it hits the &mdash;

474
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:48,170
BORIS SMUS: Right.

475
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,230
So one of the things I
discussed, as you mentioned,

476
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,330
are the progressive
image formats.

477
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,400
So if you remember in the old
days when GIFs were very

478
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,190
popular on the internet,
you can see

479
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,240
this progressive loading.

480
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,627
So first, you get kind of a
pixelly thing and then it

481
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:10,770
would refine itself instead
of the cascade of loading.

482
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,590
So most image formats actually
have this ability.

483
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,200
And a lot of the time, if you
encode it that way, it's

484
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,880
actually smaller.

485
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,490
In some cases, it's larger.

486
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,990
So I talk about that.

487
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,300
But you might think that, hey,
you can just do this and then

488
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,850
cut off the connection once
you know that getting more

489
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,760
data isn't going to improve
the quality of the image.

490
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,170
The thing with that is,
especially on mobile, you

491
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,000
don't really want to
kill connections.

492
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,890
The reason you don't want to
kill connections is because

493
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,280
now you need to respawn
a new connection.

494
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,730
And that incurs latency
overhead, which can be like a

495
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,380
whole second in many cases.

496
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:56,670
So one workaround could be
to use HTTP Range, which

497
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,780
essentially says get me this
chunk in some image.

498
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,750
So what you might do is you
might get the head of an

499
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,920
image, see the size, estimate
how much data you need, get

500
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,770
the range, and then
you don't actually

501
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,850
have to kill the request.

502
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,310
But the trouble is nobody
supports Range

503
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,780
on the server basically.

504
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,325
So anyway, more details,
check out the article.

505
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:20,720
PETE LEPAGE: It's
a great article.

506
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,800
It's really worthwhile.

507
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,240
There's a lot of great images.

508
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,482
BORIS SMUS: Thanks Pete.

509
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,130
PETE LEPAGE: I liked it.

510
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,390
BORIS SMUS: Anyway, let's talk
about some debugging stuff.

511
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:29,616
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

512
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:29,790
All right.

513
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,420
Well, I'm going to grab my
laptop here, because I want to

514
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,110
talk about some of the debugging
tools that Chrome

515
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,260
has to offer as you're building
websites and web

516
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,110
applications.

517
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,080
So I'm just going to
bring up Chrome.

518
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,320
And I want to show you a couple
of the emulation tools

519
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,550
that are available to you.

520
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,510
And then I'll jump into some
of the debugging tools.

521
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,100
So I've got Chrome up.

522
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,700
I'm running Chrome
Beta on this.

523
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,660
But in addition to Chrome Beta,
this is also available

524
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,520
on Chrome Stable, it's also
available on Chrome Dev, and

525
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,770
there's a couple other ones.

526
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,930

527
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,640
I'm going to take a sec here.

528
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,000
Apparently, we're getting
some flickers.

529
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,735
So let's try and see if I can
unflicker a little bit.

530
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:25,420

531
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,670
All right.

532
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:32,180

533
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,875
So do you want to talk about &mdash;

534
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:34,710
BORIS SMUS: Sure.

535
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,470
So basically, there's multiple
kinds of approaches you could

536
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,800
take to debugging.

537
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,100
The simplest probably, if you're
developing a mobile app

538
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,260
and don't really want to deal
with your Android device

539
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,570
plugged in via USB and doing a
remote debugging, the other

540
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:58,520
approach is to emulate some
mobile features that are

541
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,630
available in Chrome for Android
but do it directly on

542
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,160
your desktop Chrome.

543
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,660
So in the dev tools, as Pete
started saying, there's a

544
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,630
bunch of these pretty nifty
features that let you

545
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,020
essentially constrain your
Chrome browser in ways that

546
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,130
are similar to the constraints
that you'll

547
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,015
find on mobile devices.

548
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:21,740
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

549
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,360
So we've got this up.

550
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,710
So I'm going to bring up
the Chrome dev tools.

551
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,570
So I just brought them up
on my new tab page.

552
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,490
But if you click &mdash;

553
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,060
BORIS SMUS: Maybe you could
bump the size up.

554
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,740
Command Plus.

555
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,990
PETE LEPAGE: Command Plus.

556
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,560
There we go.

557
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,220
Yeah.

558
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,510
So I clicked on the settings guy
here, and that brings up

559
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,130
my settings.

560
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,770
Now, things look a little bit
weird right now because I

561
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,690
bumped the size up.

562
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,070
But there's a couple of things
that pop up here that are

563
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,740
really interesting.

564
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,060
Let me come down a little
bit in size.

565
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,380
So the first one is Override
User Agent, Override Device

566
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,720
Metrics, and Emulate
Touch Events.

567
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,950
So by going and turning on the
Override User Agent, I can go

568
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,900
in, and I can choose from
different user agents.

569
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:11,030
So I can specify, hey, I want to
emulate a Galaxy Nexus, or

570
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,470
an iPhone, or an iPad.

571
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,760
So if I choose the emulate the
Galaxy Nexus, sure enough, it

572
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,600
goes and sets my user agent
string to be the right user

573
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,620
agent string.

574
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,190
But it also goes and turns on
this Override Device Metrics

575
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,430
and sets my screen resolution
for 720 by 1280.

576
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,580
So it actually says, hey,
this is what my

577
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,250
screen resolution is.

578
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:42,480
So now, if I go down here, and
I open up google.com, sure

579
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,580
enough, I get the experience
as I would see

580
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,150
it on a mobile device.

581
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,900
BORIS SMUS: So it's both the
user agent and the device size

582
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,295
constraints.

583
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:54,330
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly.

584
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,030
So as far as Google is
concerned, I'm reporting as

585
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:03,740
this device, and as well, I'm
also getting the right screen

586
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,440
resolution.

587
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,530
So I'm kind of faking
out this.

588
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,430
Now, there's a couple of things
that I do lose here

589
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,390
that we don't get.

590
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,240
One of things we talked
about earlier was the

591
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,490
device pixel ratio.

592
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,400

593
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,550
If there's any kind of device
pixel ratio that's beyond the

594
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,690
normal, I'm not going
to get that.

595
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,520
BORIS SMUS: That's actually
on the horizon.

596
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,170
So it may be coming soon,
definitely talked to some

597
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,250
people about it.

598
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,640
It seems like a very
useful feature.

599
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,140
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

600
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,800
It's something we definitely
asked for, and we've gone in

601
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,190
and said, hey, we think this
is really important.

602
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,680
I had checked this morning to
see if it was in Canary or

603
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,450
Chromium, and it wasn't
there yet.

604
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:43,920
BORIS SMUS: Not yet.

605
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,390
PETE LEPAGE: So fingers crossed
that we'll get that

606
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,870
kind of soon.

607
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,500
Because that would
be really useful.

608
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,010
It's one of those things
that I think will help.

609
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,840
Now, one thing that sort of
caught me a couple of times, I

610
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,690
go to start using this, this
may catch you, so in this

611
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,030
particular environment, my
screen is set up for 1080

612
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,860
pixels high.

613
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,460
And you'll notice that when, I'm
just going to bring this

614
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,660
up again so that we
can see this &mdash;

615
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,480
that wasn't what I wanted.

616
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,140
Here we go.

617
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,260
There we go.

618
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,110
So I'm going to bring this up.

619
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,600
Notice my screen resolution
is set for 1280.

620
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,060
So it's a little bit bigger
than my screen.

621
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:30,261
So the browser creates that
space down below.

622
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:33,260
Now, what's happening, say,
for example, I want to see

623
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,800
this whole thing.

624
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,690
I want to get rid of this.

625
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,715
If I go close this right
now, I actually &mdash;

626
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:40,495
oh, it looks like
we fixed this.

627
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:41,070
No, we didn't.

628
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,430
BORIS SMUS: It reverted back.

629
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:42,960
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

630
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,120
It reverted back.

631
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,280
So now, what's happened
is my screen size

632
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,620
goes back to normal.

633
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,835
BORIS SMUS: So you need to have
dev tools open for the

634
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:51,555
[? screen ?] size effect.

635
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:55,050
PETE LEPAGE: So this dev tools
need to stay open if you want

636
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,570
to do that.

637
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,620
Now, there's two things
you can do there.

638
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,070
You can just sort of go and
shrink these guys really,

639
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,420
really, really tiny.

640
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,640
Or the other one you can do is
just undock them and move them

641
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,950
sort of over here.

642
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,290
And that's probably the easier
thing to do, because now you

643
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,280
can actually go and &mdash;

644
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,210
BORIS SMUS: There's actually
a third thing

645
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,455
you can do in Canary.

646
00:27:14,455 --> 00:27:16,410
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

647
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,660
Let me bring up Canary.

648
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,720

649
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,170
I think I had some fun with
Canary this morning in that It

650
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,270
wouldn't bring up the &mdash;

651
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,510
yeah, it won't bring up my &mdash;

652
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,770
BORIS SMUS: Oh, don't
worry about that.

653
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,213
But if you click on that
thing for a while and

654
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:32,180
then go like that.

655
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,050
Boom.

656
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,650
Dock to right.

657
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,810
PETE LEPAGE: Nice.

658
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,430
BORIS SMUS: So that's a
pretty cool feature.

659
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,130
PETE LEPAGE: So that's something
we can probably

660
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,350
expect to see in a future
version of Chrome.

661
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:40,960
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

662
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,720
I think it's probably
in Beta by now.

663
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,620
I'm not sure.

664
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,084
PETE LEPAGE: Well,
let's find out.

665
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:47,920
BORIS SMUS: Is this Beta?

666
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,780
PETE LEPAGE: This is Beta.

667
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,230
So it is not in Beta yet.

668
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,730
So maybe it's in Dev.

669
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,070
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, could be.

670
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,640
It'll trickle down eventually.

671
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,800
It's a very useful feature.

672
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,940
PETE LEPAGE: It really is.

673
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,410
It's one of those things to
be able to go and do this.

674
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,550
So not only do you get your user
agent override so that

675
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,100
you can go and specify, if you
do want to specify a specific

676
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,610
user agent, you can do that.

677
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,710
Because right now, they
only have Android 4.0.

678
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,000
And do you remember,
is this the Android

679
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,380
browser user agent?

680
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,630
Or is this the &mdash;

681
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,990

682
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,550
let's see &mdash;

683
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:25,940
BORIS SMUS: Good question.

684
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,240
I think it's the Android
browser user agent.

685
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,160
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

686
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,630
That looks like the
Android browser.

687
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,660
BORIS SMUS: There's no Chrome
in that string.

688
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,010
I think there's an open request
to get Chrome user

689
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,030
agents in there, Chrome for
Android and Chrome for iOS,

690
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,180
but not quite yet.

691
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,000
PETE LEPAGE: It's
not there yet.

692
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,245
BORIS SMUS: Either way, as you
were saying, you can and paste

693
00:28:47,245 --> 00:28:48,150
in anything you like.

694
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,010
You can even paste into
Googlebot if you want to see

695
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,236
how Googlebot [INAUDIBLE].

696
00:28:51,236 --> 00:28:51,960
PETE LEPAGE: Oh yeah.

697
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,050
That's a good point too.

698
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,940
So if you want to go look up the
user agent strings, if you

699
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,930
just look up Chrome Mobile UA
string, just Google that,

700
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,720
you'll come across the
documentation.

701
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,550
BORIS SMUS: You should get
to the developer site.

702
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:13,040
PETE LEPAGE: So let me just
bring these guys up again.

703
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,770
So the other one that you can do
is emulate touch events so

704
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:20,690
that if I want to go and turn on
touch events, and I'll pop

705
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,530
over here and go back
to google.com &mdash;

706
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,100
helps if I spell it right.

707
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,140
You'd think I'd be
able to do that.

708
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,260
I can sort of simulate
the touch events.

709
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,290
Now, they're not true
touch events.

710
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,595
But they're plenty close.

711
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:39,930
BORIS SMUS: I think they're true
touch events, like you

712
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,710
get the same touch start, touch
move, and touch end as

713
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,930
you would in a normal event.

714
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,650
PETE LEPAGE: So good point.

715
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,220
BORIS SMUS: So a lot of sites
that are designed for mobile,

716
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,940
like this one, might not respond
to clicks directly,

717
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,910
because they assume that &mdash;

718
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,480
PETE LEPAGE: Oh yeah.

719
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,470
They're not expecting
a click event.

720
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,600
They're expecting only
the touch event.

721
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,370
BORIS SMUS: It might be that
there's a mobile user agent,

722
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,440
and they just say, OK,
there's only touches.

723
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,890
So it's useful in that case.

724
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,340
But of course, it's
not multi-touch.

725
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:06,680
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

726
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,400
So I can't go and do any
multi-touch kind of stuff

727
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,390
unfortunately.

728
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,300
All right.

729
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:18,380
So that's the emulation stuff
that you've got within Chrome.

730
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,710
The other one that's available
is Chrome remote debugging.

731
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:26,500
And with the Chrome remote
debugging, there's a video and

732
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,520
lots of good documentation
on that.

733
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:34,980
But on my phone, I'm just going
to go and open up Chrome

734
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,960
so that I've got something
that we can go

735
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,210
have a look at here.

736
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,810

737
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,870
Now, before you do this, you
need to have ADB installed.

738
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,150
Now, ADB is the Android
Debugger.

739
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,290
And it allows you to do
some port forwarding

740
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,740
and things like that.

741
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,540
Once you've got ADB installed,
which is not all that hard &mdash;

742
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,520
it's a pretty easy process
to step through &mdash;

743
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,960
you need to plug your phone
into your laptop via USB.

744
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,210
And you need to turn on two
things on your phone.

745
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,590
In the settings menu
for the phone, you

746
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,560
need to enable debugging.

747
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,560
So go into the debugging
settings, turn that on.

748
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,740
And then the second piece that
you need to do is within

749
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,430
Chrome, you need to turn on
the remote debugging.

750
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,290
So I've done that
on this device.

751
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,660
And now I need to start
the debugging stuff.

752
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,290
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

753
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,190
So generally, the stuff on the
device persists, at least the

754
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,820
system-wide debugging does.

755
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,500
The Chrome one sometimes turns
off for some reason.

756
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,290
So you might have
to turn that on.

757
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,940
But there's a bit of like
one time setup.

758
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,880
Hopefully, you won't need
to do it all the time.

759
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,570
PETE LEPAGE: Once that setup's
done, it's pretty easy.

760
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:54,110
I've actually created a little
script to make my debugging a

761
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,680
little bit easier, because I
don't like to remember ADB

762
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,850
forward TCP colon 922 &mdash;

763
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,760
It's just more than I
like to remember.

764
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,710
So I just got a little script
that I can do, clank, debug.

765
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,270
So that starts my
clank debugger.

766
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:13,010
BORIS SMUS: So what that
actually does is this Chrome

767
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,910
for Android runs a server,
basically.

768
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,840
And it runs the Chrome
dev tools protocol.

769
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,130
And what this does, it
sets up the port.

770
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,880
It opens the port here
to make that

771
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,030
connectable from your desktop.

772
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,180
PETE LEPAGE: So now, through
the USB, I've opened a TCP

773
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,015
port to the server on here.

774
00:32:35,015 --> 00:32:38,530
BORIS SMUS: It's actually a
little more complicated.

775
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,030
You'll see.

776
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,085
Anyway, we should
open this up.

777
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:41,840
PETE LEPAGE: So now,
I've opened it up.

778
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,700
And sure enough, I see my list
of inspectable pages.

779
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,690
I can click on this.

780
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,320
BORIS SMUS: So you'll see it
actually went to a front end

781
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,880
that's on the web.

782
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,055
The URL here is chromedevtoolsfr

783
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,305
ontend.appspot.com.

784
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,860

785
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,460
So it actually serves the
front end from there and

786
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,770
points it to here.

787
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,150
So a bit of indirection.

788
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,320
PETE LEPAGE: We've got a little
bit of funky stuff.

789
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,740
BORIS SMUS: But it works
really well.

790
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,500
So it's awesome.

791
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,880
PETE LEPAGE: So now, as I start
looking at the content

792
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,570
that's on here, I can actually
start expanding these out and

793
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:18,130
seeing what's going on in
my particular page.

794
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,190
So I can expand this out, and
say, hey, there's divs.

795
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,370
There's an iframe.

796
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:28,540
And as I start expanding these
out, you can see that

797
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,030
different parts of the page
start to get highlighted.

798
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,140
BORIS SMUS: So you have full
control basically.

799
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,870
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly.

800
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,370
It's just like debugging
on my desktop.

801
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,290
Like if I'm debugging,
I can go in.

802
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,560
I could be like, oh, hey, I can
change everything live.

803
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,610
I've got all the same
capabilities that I would have

804
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,290
if I were debugging Chrome
on my desktop.

805
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,680
I can set CSS styles.

806
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,000
I can set attributes,
remove attributes.

807
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,810
I can add and remove elements,
all the stuff that I'm used to

808
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,110
being able to do.

809
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,180
In fact, I can even go in and
use some of the auditing and

810
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,220
profiling tools to be able to
understand exactly where

811
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,393
everything is.

812
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:10,350
BORIS SMUS: It's especially
important for mobile.

813
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,429
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly.

814
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:17,949
To understand how your network
requests are coming in, it's

815
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:19,290
actually something really
interesting.

816
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,750
One of the projects I was
working on, we found a bug

817
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,250
that only happened when you
are connected on 3G.

818
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,500
So we were testing this.

819
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,429
We were always on Wi-Fi,
because that's &mdash;

820
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:32,719
generally if you can go
on a fast connection.

821
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,340
We're great.

822
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,150
And we were like,
all right, yeah.

823
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,840
And a couple of hours before we
were supposed to ship this

824
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,110
thing, I was doing my last like
sanity checks and went,

825
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:47,770
oh crap, it doesn't work
with Wi-Fi turned off.

826
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,210
And so sure enough, it was just
this little thing where

827
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,520
something wasn't coming in quite
fast enough, and it was

828
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,130
just sitting there forever.

829
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,320
And so we made a couple
of minor corrections.

830
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,380
But it was one of
those things.

831
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,850
So being able to go in and see
the profiling tools, the

832
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:08,240
timeline for how requests get
made is a really useful tool

833
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,070
to be able to have.

834
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,810
BORIS SMUS: Right.

835
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,325
So actually, that will
be network, right?

836
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:12,040
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

837
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,470
Yeah.

838
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,735
There's network.

839
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:16,560
BORIS SMUS: Timeline is
also very useful.

840
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,900
PETE LEPAGE: So if I reload
this page, sure enough,

841
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,260
there's all the resources that
are getting loaded for this

842
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,290
particular image.

843
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,070
And I can see how
long this took.

844
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:32,570
So like the page DOM content
loaded was fired here

845
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,080
at this blue line.

846
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,190
And here at this red line,
the load event was fired.

847
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,820
BORIS SMUS: That's awesome.

848
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,450
Super useful.

849
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,350
PETE LEPAGE: Very useful.

850
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:40,810
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

851
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,960
So this is running milestone
18 of Chrome.

852
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,530
And it's on par with m18.

853
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,060
But now Chrome has moved
a little forward.

854
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,790
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

855
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,520
So I'm running Chrome Beta
on this machine.

856
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,350
And Chrome Beta is 21.

857
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:02,590
So Stable will be 20.

858
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:02,870
All right.

859
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,640
So with that, why don't me pop
over and take a couple of the

860
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,490
questions from the
moderator queue?

861
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,765
BORIS SMUS: Sounds good.

862
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:12,520

863
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,060
PETE LEPAGE: I'll grab
the first one.

864
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,310
So the first question &mdash; let me
just reload this, make sure

865
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,560
we've got the latest stuff.

866
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,820

867
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,490
What's your opinion on using
mobile framework such as

868
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,296
jQuery Mobile?

869
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:29,460
BORIS SMUS: Good question.

870
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,260
PETE LEPAGE: It is
a good question.

871
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:37,930
So I think, my opinion, using
stuff like that has its place.

872
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,860
And I've used jQuery Mobile
for a couple projects.

873
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,480
I thought it was a neat sort
of place to start and

874
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,390
experiment with.

875
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,350
It doesn't necessarily work
for every single project.

876
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:56,280
And it does provide a few
headaches here and there, if

877
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,540
you want to do things that
jQuery Mobile doesn't support

878
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,610
or sort of falls outside
the box.

879
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,665
What's your view on it?

880
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:04,730
BORIS SMUS: I kind of agree.

881
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:09,490
I think it's great for sort of
these apps that are very

882
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,940
content-centric.

883
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,300
So you have like hierarchical
sets of views that are all

884
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,190
kind of similar and
maybe text heavy.

885
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,570
PETE LEPAGE: I want to
go look something up.

886
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,110
I want to flow through
something,

887
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,900
something like that.

888
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,760
BORIS SMUS: And you can break
out of the mold with plug-ins

889
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,420
that have a plug-in framework.

890
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,620
So if you want to do something
a little bit outside of that

891
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,950
framework, it's fine.

892
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:35,520
But if you're doing like a
complex app with its own kind

893
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,550
of UI, maybe there's some
drawing app or something where

894
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,460
it's a lot of interaction that's
not really common to

895
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,020
the sorts of apps that it's
designed for, I would say

896
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,530
don't use it and like look
to something else.

897
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:53,590
Maybe look to a framework like
Sencha or something like that.

898
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,090
Or roll your own.

899
00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:00,590
Because ultimately, you might
need to go there.

900
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:04,172
PETE LEPAGE: Do you want to read
off the next question?

901
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:07,670
BORIS SMUS: OK, let's see.

902
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,880
Any way to launch Chrome
after clicking links

903
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,780
in any apps on iPad?

904
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,020
It launches Safari even
after updating Gmail?

905
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,290
Right.

906
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:21,270
So basically, you can &mdash;

907
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:25,520
as an iOS app developer, you
can write an app that will

908
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,140
check if Chrome is installed
and launch

909
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,780
Chrome instead of Safari.

910
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,620
That said, it's up to the app
developer and not the user.

911
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:39,120
So if I, the user, say if I
want Chrome to be launched

912
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,760
every time any link opens,
I'm out of luck.

913
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,220
iOS doesn't provide that
sort of flexibility.

914
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:52,410
So about Gmail specifically,
they have their own agendas.

915
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,280
PETE LEPAGE: They
may hopefully.

916
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,210
That's actually a good point.

917
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,400
We'll go send an email
to the Gmail team.

918
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,340
But I know that the Google+
team just updated their

919
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:09,690
Google+ app.

920
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,020
If Chrome is installed, it'll
open links in Chrome on iOS if

921
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,170
it's installed.

922
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,190
So it's going to be a matter
of getting developers to go

923
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,570
and start doing that.

924
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:29,020
If you have an app or use an
app, go ask your developer to

925
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,770
enable that feature.

926
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,540
That will be a really
nice thing to have.

927
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:31,940
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

928
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,970
Totally.

929
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,230
All right.

930
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,830
Next question?

931
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,560
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

932
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:34,830
Next question.

933
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,830
BORIS SMUS: All right.

934
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:41,080
So there's a question about
using a master key to secure

935
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,142
saved passwords in
Chrome for PC.

936
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:47,240

937
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,240
So I think this is something
about key chaining, probably &mdash;

938
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,290
PETE LEPAGE: What's the
specific question say?

939
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,630
BORIS SMUS: What about a master
key to secure the saved

940
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,110
passwords in Chrome for PC?

941
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,060
PETE LEPAGE: Huh.

942
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,390
So I would say maybe if &mdash;

943
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,950
I am not sure I quite understand
the question, but

944
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,210
if you can go provide a little
bit more detail in there,

945
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:11,560
we'll take a look at that this
afternoon and try and put an

946
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,890
answer in there if we
can understand that.

947
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,280
BORIS SMUS: There
was one more.

948
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,630
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

949
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,380
One more question.

950
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,100
I think we'll take this as
our last question and

951
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,385
then wrap it up.

952
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,300
BORIS SMUS: So workarounds
to &mdash;

953
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,610
this is not really
Mobile-related, but I think we

954
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,290
can probably talk a
little bit about.

955
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,710
Workarounds to execute
dynamically generated scripts

956
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,180
in iframes in Manifest 2.

957
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,945
So this is an app or
extension question.

958
00:40:36,945 --> 00:40:40,900
PETE LEPAGE: So I think with
that, the one piece that I

959
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,160
would say to go have a look at
is the sandboxed iframe stuff.

960
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,120
Because with sandbox iframes &mdash;

961
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,940
with Manifest version
2, they implement

962
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,380
Content Security Policy.

963
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,440
Content Security Policy is a
piece that helps to protect

964
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,740
you from cross-site scripting
and other security

965
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,160
vulnerabilities.

966
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,360
And it restricts some of the
things that can happen.

967
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,650
With a sandboxed iframe, you
can do a lot of not so safe

968
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,330
stuff, but it's sandboxed
and can't get outside

969
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,430
that sandbox generally.

970
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,460
BORIS SMUS: So you can do eval
in a sandboxed iframe?

971
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,970
PETE LEPAGE: You know, I can't
remember the exact list of

972
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,550
things, but I think you may
be able to do that.

973
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:22,460
So it's worth having a look
at the sandboxed iframe.

974
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,810
And the sandboxed iframe is
actually a larger piece that

975
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:29,650
doesn't just fit into Chrome
apps and extensions, but it's

976
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,380
something that's coming
to the web in general.

977
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,330
BORIS SMUS: Right.

978
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,450
And if you're doing it on the
web in general, you can also

979
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,590
set your own custom Content
Security Policy.

980
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,320
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

981
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,410
And you can modify
that as well.

982
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,540
BORIS SMUS: So I guess Manifest
2 sort of suggests

983
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,232
that you're doing it in Chrome
apps or extensions.

984
00:41:47,232 --> 00:41:48,690
PETE LEPAGE: Good point.

985
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,410
BORIS SMUS: All right.

986
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,330
I think that's all
the time we have.

987
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,660
So thanks guys for joining us.

988
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,530
PETE LEPAGE: Thank
you very much.

989
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:57,290
And we'll be doing these
more regularly.

990
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,630
We'd love to hear
your feedback.

991
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,560
Let us know either through
the comments or

992
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,520
anything like that.

993
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,030
So with that, thanks
very much.

994
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,635
And we'll chat soon.

995
00:42:06,635 --> 00:42:07,885
Bye bye.

996
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:35,400
