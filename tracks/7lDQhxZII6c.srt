1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,570

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,400
PAUL: Hi guys.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,630
I'm Paul Kinlan and I'd
like to introduce Alex

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,252
[? Krymovsky, ?]

5
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:17,056
who is a product &mdash; you're a
product manager, right?

6
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:18,410
ALEX: Yes, product manager
on the web platform.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,090
PAUL: Cool, on the
web platform.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,990
I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,630
And I'm working, well, actually,
we are both working

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,170
on the Web Intents project.

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,250
Today this is the first of our,
hopefully, biweekly, or

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,830
fortnightly, as we say in the
UK at least, series of Web

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,000
Intents Wednesdays.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,520
It's not every single
Wednesday.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,290
We want to try and kick start
the community, and kick start,

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,300
basically the hype.

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,930
What kind of what's
happening inside

18
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:44,860
the developer community.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,910
What's happening
with the apps.

20
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,510
What's happening with
Web Intents.

21
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,000
And just find a generally
friendly way to actually get

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,890
in contact with you, the
developers, building

23
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,710
applications on the web today.

24
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,850
Who are interested
in Web Intents.

25
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,980
Who want to know what
it's all about.

26
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,625
And, yeah, let's go from here.

27
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,300
So, we have a little bit of a
technical snag at the moment.

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,120
We wanted to give you a nice
demonstration of what Web

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,110
Intents are.

30
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,550
And, show you some
applications.

31
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,160
But, unfortunately, the software
that I'm using,

32
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,250
decided to start working about
three or four minutes before

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,930
the presentation.

34
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,960
So, my apologies.

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,470
The next time we do this, we'll
give you a better set of

36
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,190
demonstrations, and, hopefully,
show some

37
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,100
applications that all
the developers have

38
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,090
built in the ecosystem.

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,400
But in the meantime, we must as
well just get started, and

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,740
talk about what Web
Intents are.

41
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,800
Hopefully, Alex will be able
to grill me with all of the

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,715
questions that US developers
also my interested with.

43
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:40,350
ALEX: Yep, so I'll be playing
the role of you, basically, in

44
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,500
this interview, asking him all
the hard questions as far as

45
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,210
to channel what you'd be
asking, hopefully.

46
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:44,430
PAUL: Cool.

47
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,490
So we also do have
a moderator page.

48
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,272
It's on our Google developer's
live moderator.

49
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:52,720
So, if you just go to our
YouTube channel and see this

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,570
event, you'll be able to
go and ask questions.

51
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,540
We do have a really set of
questions that we're going to

52
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,710
try and ask, answer or ask
answer a little bit later.

53
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,280
But, anyway, we'll start
with an introduction.

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,190
So, like many people, you might
have heard a little bit

55
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,050
about Web Intents, but are
not actually quite

56
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,250
sure what it is.

57
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,920
So, Web Intends is basically
a standard, or

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
not standard, sorry.

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,650
Not standard yet.

60
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,910
It's a specification that's
built into Chrome that we are

61
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,880
working on with the W3C at the
moment, to actually help

62
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,780
application developers be
able to integrate their

63
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,750
applications a lot
more easily.

64
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,830
Right now application
developers, if they want to

65
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,380
build an application, I don't
know, that talks to Twitter,

66
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,290
or some other remote kind of
sharing service, you have to

67
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,760
normally do a deep
integration.

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,510
You know, the user not only
has to install a piece of

69
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,800
software, whether it's a
bookmarklet, or some other

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,695
kind of widget to actually
have the share happen.

71
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,040
And Web Intents is designed to
kind of say, well you could

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,210
use to develop but you can't
actually build all these deep

73
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,410
integrations into your
application.

74
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,460
You can't support every single
social network that lives on

75
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,900
the open web today.

76
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,770
But you want to give your users
control, give your users

77
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,610
some flexibility to be able to
choose the services that they

78
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,170
want to use for these actions
across the web.

79
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,950
Now, the interesting thing is
at the Web Intents API is

80
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,360
designed to kind of slightly
dis-intermediate some of the

81
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,280
APR integrations.

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,940
You don't have to have a deep
integration to be able talk to

83
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,340
the remote services.

84
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,430
And just before we continue, I'm
just going to move this,

85
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,190
because, it turns out, I
composition cameras very well

86
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,560
for our presentations.

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,870
And now, Alex is out
of the shot.

88
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,850
So here we go.

89
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,430
That's a little bit better.

90
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,520
At least it should look like
I'm looking at you, rather

91
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,670
than at some person
behind the screen.

92
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,870
So I apologize.

93
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,410
So, Web Intents is just a simple
APR that allows us to

94
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,480
build applications that talk to
each other way more easily

95
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,470
than it is right now.

96
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,340
We would normally show
a demonstration, but

97
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,125
unfortunately, because the
screen sharing doesn't work.

98
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,200
And It is my machine, and
it's all my fault.

99
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,320
It's not a problem with
the actual software.

100
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,420
We can't shoot a nice little
demonstration.

101
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,400
So, I tell you what.

102
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,730
Should we talk about some
of the news, things &mdash;

103
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,964
ALEX: Yeah, let's talk about
what's happened in the last

104
00:03:55,964 --> 00:03:56,300
couple of weeks.

105
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,820
PAUL: Yeah, OK.

106
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,310
Cool.

107
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,615
So in the past couple of weeks
what's kind of happened with

108
00:03:59,615 --> 00:03:59,980
Web Intents.

109
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,270
Well, I think the first and the
biggest thing, for me at

110
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,450
least, was we did a presentation
at Google I/O. It

111
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,200
Is on our YouTube channel at the
moment if you want to go

112
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,070
and check it out.

113
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,150
And actually, there you will
see demonstrations that are

114
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,890
live, that we did on stage,
using the Web Intents API.

115
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,560
So, we do have a presentation.

116
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,540
We also had a really kind of
interesting meeting with W3C,

117
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,839
where I wasn't actually present,
I was on the phone

118
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,380
call at the time, where we were
kind to talking about how

119
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,150
we can basically integrate
further

120
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,890
API's into Web Intents.

121
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,392
I'm going to share the links,
the notes, because the notes

122
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:34,170
are publicly available, but
not many people read them.

123
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,661
So, just after this presentation
I'm going to

124
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:36,630
share the notes.

125
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,570
The interesting thing is that
it's interesting to see the

126
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,455
types of APIs that want to
integrate with Web Intents, so

127
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:45,630
if people want be able to pick
media, or picks contact from

128
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,120
your particular device, so let's
say, it's your phone.

129
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,970
You want to be able to pick
a contact from your phone.

130
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,690
And the best way to do it, well
maybe, not the best of it

131
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,990
right now, but the best way
we're thinking about doing it

132
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,800
is by the Web Intents API.

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,470
So you can basically say, you
know, i need to pick a contact

134
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,220
from my address book.

135
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,420
Your address book on your phone
could actually live as

136
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,370
the physical address book, but
it could also be Google

137
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,410
contacts, it could be whatever,
it can have services

138
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,852
support on the web,
that support to be

139
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,020
able to pick contacts.

140
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,610
So that's one of the areas
that we talked about.

141
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,530
And also picking
media as well.

142
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,900
So, the idea is your phone
might have a gallery, you

143
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,340
might have a gallery
of your favorite

144
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,280
photos on the web somewhere.

145
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,540
You know, you should be able
to pick that photo, or any

146
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,366
kind of media from those devices
and actually be able

147
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,060
to manipulate in such
application.

148
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,370
ALEX: I think, the point here
is that Web Intents is not

149
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,310
just one singular API, it's
actually enabler with lots of

150
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,740
other stuff.

151
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,130
PAUL: Yeah.

152
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,700
ALEX: So, people are really
starting to discuss,

153
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,170
especially right now in W3C and
other standards bodies and

154
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,820
groups, how they could use this
plumbing of Web Intents

155
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,620
to connect up applications with
other things, like media

156
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,988
galleries and that
kind of stuff.

157
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:46,620
PAUL: Yeah, that's the kind
of interesting thing.

158
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,360
We all talk about
sharing data.

159
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,480
You know, to be able to share a
link to a social network is

160
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,610
one of the key APIs.

161
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,350
But that's actually one of
really small facet of what Web

162
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,650
Intents is trying to do.

163
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,990
You know, we want to connect
applications based on an

164
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,930
action, so the user wants
to perform some

165
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,280
action on the web.

166
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,610
They want to edit
an image, right.

167
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,970
Well, they want to kind of
pick a document from some

168
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,780
cloud file storage solution.

169
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,560
They should be generalized
actions by an API, which

170
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,190
hopefully is Web Intents, to be
able to just let you say,

171
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,810
well, my application I need to
pick an image from somewhere

172
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,670
on the web.

173
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,356
It could be on your hard drive,
it could be on your

174
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,970
cloud file storage solution.

175
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,226
We've got some Chrome
extensions, which I'll want to

176
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:25,610
share out a little bit later,
which let you pick an image

177
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,580
from an individual tab, that's
running inside your browser.

178
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,370
Which is kind of cool, right?

179
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,100
I mean picking an image from
another web page that's

180
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,560
actually inside your browser,
is actually a

181
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,000
pretty complex task.

182
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,090
You find the image, you right
click it, download it

183
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,310
somewhere, and upload it into
another application.

184
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,540
ALEX: I do it all the time.

185
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,460
PAUL: Yeah, I mean, everyone's
got this download's directory

186
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,890
that's just full of &mdash;

187
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,190
whoa, I was going to say
a rude word &mdash; rubbish.

188
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,840
it's just full of things,
you know, it's just like

189
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,440
[INAUDIBLE] basically.

190
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,180
You just download it, you never
delete it, you never get

191
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,640
around to, because your
applications aren't

192
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,840
integrated.

193
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,706
So, yeah it's not just share,
it's pick, it's edit, it's the

194
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:00,037
ability to say, I need to
edit this image just to

195
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,570
remove some red eye.

196
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,690
You have to find an application
that supports

197
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,970
image editing, and you'll be
able to send the data there

198
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,690
and pull it back.

199
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,950
So next week I'll show you &mdash;
well, not next week, the next

200
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,110
time we do this in two weeks
time, I'll show you a proper

201
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,030
demonstration about how
old all this hooks up.

202
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,650
And I'll actually show you the
code as well, because it's

203
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,570
actually really simple.

204
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,460
ALEX: It's surprisingly simple
to get this to work.

205
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,830
PAUL: Yeah, so the demo that
we have is on [INAUDIBLE].

206
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,730
It's like twenty lines of code
with four different actions.

207
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,982
ALEX: So you can wait for two
weeks to see the demo, or you

208
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:35,795
can just check out the I/O
video, which shows off the

209
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:37,990
demo, more complicated demo
has all [INAUDIBLE].

210
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,370
PAUL: And it also shows a really
cool presentation of &mdash;

211
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,060
I say presentation, a picture
of when I prove I invented

212
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,270
Google glass.

213
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,890
Two or three years ago, right.

214
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,790
You have to go check it out.

215
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,000
Just check it out to see what
it's like, because, I think,

216
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,120
it's pretty cool, but
no one believes me.

217
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,420
Cool, so &mdash;

218
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,320
ALEX: Shall we do questions?

219
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,310
ALEX: Yeah.

220
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,540
We might as well jump
to the questions.

221
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,350
We have about 10 questions
so far.

222
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,370
ALEX: And just so
you know, again.

223
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,420
The link to submit questions in
the Google Moderator page

224
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,700
is on the plus page.

225
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,820
So, follow that link, submit
some questions and we'll walk

226
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,000
through these.

227
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,570
PAUL: Yeah.

228
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,710
I mean this week is very much
an experimentation week.

229
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,010
We want to hear feedback from
you guys about what you want

230
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,190
to hear, what you want to see,
and just kind of the types of

231
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,510
information that you'd like
to get info, a kind of

232
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,180
bi-weekly round up.

233
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,880
So, feel free to email me.
paulkinlan@googl.com.

234
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,275
I'm very open to share
my email address, so

235
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:33,559
it's not too bad.

236
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,830
But, yeah, let's jump into
these questions.

237
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,549
So the first question from x is
have you considered cross

238
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,650
Android Web Intents.

239
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,030
Could you enable some interest
in these cases like being able

240
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,370
to directly launch into related
parts of a web app

241
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,680
from a related Android
app and vice versa.

242
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,310
ALEX: I think, and we were just
talking about how there's

243
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,320
interest in W3C in using Web
Intents for all other things

244
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,960
to connect MediaStreams and
that kind of thing.

245
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,770
And I think this is exactly
the same vein, right?

246
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,590
Web Intents is very directly
inspired by Android intents.

247
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,010
They work together relatively
nicely because they are

248
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,840
directly inspired, and you could
imagine all kinds of

249
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,930
really interesting use cases
they are connected to.

250
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,820
So, I think, this is absolutely
a great idea.

251
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,950
It's something really cool
that we'd love to do.

252
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,100
But, right now, we
don't have it.

253
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,675
PAUL: I mean, I right now,
we don't have it.

254
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:27,120
It's something we or I'm
quite passionate about.

255
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,940
However, we have a really big
problem on the web in the

256
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,780
sense that we can't connect
apps easily, right?

257
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,320
We want to make sure the web
developers and apps on the web

258
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,985
at that moment get great
experience like an

259
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:39,660
interconnected experience.

260
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,820
ALEX: So we're focusing
on making it

261
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,970
work in Chrome today.

262
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,450
Implementing that spec that's
being discussed in W3C before

263
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,960
we move on to even bigger
and cooler things.

264
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,854
[INAUDIBLE]

265
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:51,750
Android Intents.

266
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,660
PAUL: I mean people on the W3C
at the moment have been

267
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,020
talking about trying to
integrate with TVs, right.

268
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,870
So, you say I need to play a
video, I need to share a video

269
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,000
with something that
can play a video.

270
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,290
You find Intent, you know the
browser, might be able to

271
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,820
discover a list of devices that
are connected to your

272
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,370
home network by UPnP
discovery.

273
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,440
And send the video straight
out to that remote device,

274
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,970
straight from you web app.

275
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,670
ALEX: The possibilities
are really cool.

276
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,940
There are a lot of really neat
use cases that are made.

277
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,750
Very easy with Web Intents.

278
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,926
A lot of people are looking
and are excited to

279
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:20,490
build on top of.

280
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,080
PAUL: Yeah, but we just
start now, right?

281
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,130
ALEX: Just start now.

282
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,550
PAUL: Is it right?

283
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,780
We've only been I
think publicly &mdash;

284
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,320
we announced it a year ago?

285
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,770
ALEX: I think so.

286
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,260
PAUL: I think about
a year ago.

287
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,410
We've been working on new
implementations like Chrome,

288
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,750
working with standards groups
as well to actually get this

289
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,990
off to a good level before we
can actually start thinking

290
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,930
about integrating externally.

291
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,830
Ah, cool, so I hope that
answered the question.

292
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,100
We also have another
question &mdash;

293
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,605
what browsers support
Web Intents?

294
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:45,940
Ah Chrome.

295
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,040
Chrome definitely supports Web
Intents from stable right

296
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,940
through its Canary.

297
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,980
Obviously, Canary he's got some
of the latest things that

298
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,250
are happening inside the API.

299
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,870
But it is actually on a stable
channel of Chrome.

300
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,210
ALEX: I think one of the
important things to emphasize

301
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:02,330
here is that this standard Web
Intents, we're hoping one day

302
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,930
will become formal standard.

303
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,330
But we're discussing it's an
active, it's a working draft

304
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,380
right now spec in the W3C.

305
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,680
So although Chrome is the only
one that currently implements

306
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,580
it, we've been laying the
groundwork having discussions

307
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,180
with all the browser vendors
in the standards bodies to

308
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,780
make this something that other
browsers can one day

309
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,460
implement as well.

310
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,710
PAUL: Yeah, I mean there's a
good implantation generally

311
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,030
inside WebKit as well now so,
the theory is that anyone who

312
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,600
implements WebKit could also an
implementation themselves

313
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,010
of Web Intents quite easily.

314
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,100
ALEX: So, although, this is
currently only implemented in

315
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,460
Chrome, [INAUDIBLE], there's
hope other browsers

316
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,990
will pick this up.

317
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,910
I should also too really quickly
that the implantation

318
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,750
we have in Chrome right
now is experimental.

319
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,040
We know this API as developing
it is going through the

320
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,830
specification process as we're
talking to other browser

321
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,890
vendors, some things
might change.

322
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,290
And right now, it's definitely,
we want to get it

323
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,350
out there, so that developers
can start using it, can start

324
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,230
showing off all the cool things
they can do with it.

325
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,310
And help us develop and
evolve the spec.

326
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,620
So &mdash;

327
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,960
PAUL: And we have
a shim as well.

328
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,976
Which the shim works in
Internet Explorer 8?

329
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:03,730
ALEX: Yeah.

330
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,640
PAUL: 8 and above.

331
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,950
Opera, I can't remember
which version.

332
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,670
I know it works in the latest
version of Opera.

333
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,180
It did work in Firefox, I need
to fix a book, because I

334
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,390
introduced Content Security
Policy, which I won't say is a

335
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,830
complete nightmare, but it's
harder to implement than other

336
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,950
kind of APIs at the moment.

337
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,950
ALEX: So, basically, the shim
allows you, although Chrome

338
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,060
implements it currently directly
into the browser, the

339
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,130
shim basically allows you to
instead use the JavaScript, a

340
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,815
little bit of JavaScript
include, that would then sort

341
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,380
of pop separate iFrame to allow
the user to pick which

342
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,300
action they wanted and then
connect to the service.

343
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,560
PAUL: Yeah, the theory is it'll
be binary compatible

344
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,410
with the API.

345
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,370
Obviously, as the API changes,
we might get to the points,

346
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,260
where your JavaScript won't be
able to do exactly what we

347
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,080
want to do, but by then,
hopefully, other browser

348
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,410
vendors will kind of all
use the same API.

349
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,437
OK, so the next question- how do
you &mdash; oh, actually there's

350
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,090
another trick question
jumped up in front.

351
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,960
How do you include the support
for suggestions [INAUDIBLE]

352
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
in Web Intents in Chrome?

353
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,340
If not, when will we
see the support?

354
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,180
So, just a bit of background
behind this.

355
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,090
Because we couldn't
show the demo.

356
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,590
Web Intents has got quite a few
little features already

357
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,810
built in, when the Web Intents
implementation inside Chrome

358
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,720
has got discovery
features built

359
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,400
straight into the interface.

360
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,470
And One of those features
is the ability to find

361
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,430
applications that will, say,
have the support to,

362
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,700
say, edit an image.

363
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,560
So, the user says, I
need an application

364
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,190
to edit this image.

365
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,960
We can pop up a list, that
basically says this is the

366
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,062
application that the user
has installed right now.

367
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,740
Being that there are other
applications on the Chrome Web

368
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,890
Store which also supports same
types of functionality,

369
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,010
editing images, picking data
from other services.

370
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,380
So one of the things that people
have asked for is the

371
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,370
ability to, basically, manually
control that list of

372
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,460
suggested services, not
necessary have them come from

373
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,820
the Chrome Web Store.

374
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,500
The reason being, you might
know, for instance, that you

375
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,130
support Twitter, right, and you
want to have that ability

376
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,020
for the user, if they haven't
got it installed, to be able

377
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,530
to install that application,
which might not necessarily

378
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,390
directly come from the
Chrome Web Store.

379
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,560
So the suggestions is
basically a list of

380
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,790
developer-provided suggested
services, that they know

381
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,430
complete the action
and complement

382
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,610
their site very well.

383
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,922
ALEX: So, if you're firing and
intent, and saying that you

384
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:18,850
are starting an intent, and you
know if your apps already,

385
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,910
that are pretty good matches for
it, you can provide those,

386
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,080
so they could be shown to
the user as suggestions.

387
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,040
PAUL: Yeah, It basically,
it's to solve

388
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,050
the bootstrap problem.

389
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,420
We think we've done a really
good job in Chrome in sense of

390
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,920
providing this set of
applications from

391
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,930
the Chrome Web Store.

392
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,420
But quite often developers
would want to

393
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,825
provide their own list.

394
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,480
So, it's actually onto
the question.

395
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,900
It's not implemented just yet.

396
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,120
I believe, we're still working
on it at the moment.

397
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,760
The reason why it's kind of a
little bit up in the air is

398
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,230
because when we've been talking
to the guys at W3C, we

399
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,620
have to iron out a
couple of things.

400
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,960
But it's something that we want
to support, and we got a

401
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,600
lot of developer feedback.

402
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,430
It's just a matter
of kind of when.

403
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,950
So, if you have any suggestions,
I would suggest

404
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,800
that you kind of just pop some
feedback on the Web Public

405
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,290
Intents group on the W3C,
and again, I'll share

406
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,630
the actual list out.

407
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,570
But there is some active
conversations going on about

408
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,750
the types of features that are
needed by developers to have

409
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,270
this API, to make sure it's of
use to them essentially.

410
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,450
So we'd like to say, we don't
have support for suggestions

411
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,660
just yet, but it should be &mdash;

412
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,300
hopefully soon, it all depends
on the W3C instead of

413
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,780
[INAUDIBLE].

414
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,300
ALEX: Just to emphasize, this is
definitely an evolving API.

415
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,790
We're learning as
people use it.

416
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,960
What things are useful,
what things they need.

417
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,920
And so we're listening very
carefully to what you guys,

418
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,226
what your feedback is on this
API, to help put feedback into

419
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,152
this specification process in
implementation in Chrome.

420
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:40,400
PAUL: Yeah, So, that was
Glen Jones in Brighton.

421
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,770
So, I've noticed we've got a
whole load more of questions

422
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,090
in, today as well.

423
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,175
So, hopefully we'll be
able to answer them.

424
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,800
So, let's have a look.

425
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,320
Have you been doing any work
with NFC being enable to

426
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,600
receive Web Intents from tags?

427
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,870
Android Beam et cetera, seems
like a logical fit.

428
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,380
I think the quite frank
answer is not directly

429
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,330
anything with NFC.

430
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,330
I think there's a couple of
interesting possibilities,

431
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,155
which, I believe, have been
discussed briefly on the

432
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,160
Public Intents group.

433
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,310
Basically being able to kind of
look out for the URLs, the

434
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,255
user might might go to that
applications now can handle.

435
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:18,140
But, this is just too early on
the the whole specification

436
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,480
the moment.

437
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,090
We want to make sure that we
have a good solid ground to be

438
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,830
able to find applications that
perform definite tasks before

439
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,250
we think too much about trying
to integrate with NFC.

440
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,050
ALEX: There's possibilities,
really cool ideas.

441
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,150
Like NSC is a great idea here.

442
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,100
But we just have a lot of stuff
that we're trying to do.

443
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,510
And so we want to get
to that point.

444
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,500
But right now, we're focusing
on really making sure that's

445
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,535
the core foundation is really
solid, and something people

446
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,750
could build on top of.

447
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,010
PAUL: Cool.

448
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,640
So, yes, I hope, that answered
the question.

449
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,610
You know, it's one of
those things, right.

450
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,480
And then we're tracking this
now, so we should be able to

451
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,920
give you some information
as things change.

452
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,280
So, if we talk about it on the
Intents Group, the W3C, then

453
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,170
we should be able to find a nice
way to actually give you

454
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,780
this information back.

455
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,330
And, so the next question.

456
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,380
In the recent Google I/O 2012
talk you mentioned that the

457
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,690
interface for Web Intents in
Chrome is currently being

458
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,810
redesigned.

459
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,089
When will we get to see it, and
can you talk about it now?

460
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,490
ALEX: Also, one of the coolest
things that I think is really

461
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,624
cool about Chrome is that we do
the vast, vast majority of

462
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:21,710
the development in the open.

463
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,150
So, if you're using Canary,
you're seeing the very cutting

464
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,020
edge of what's in Chrome.

465
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,980
So already some of this
work has started.

466
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,190
And actually, if we were able to
show the demos, then you'd

467
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,390
see that the UI shifted already
a little bit, and so

468
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,140
we're already starting to make
progress on updating this UI

469
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,950
and making it really,
really smooth.

470
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,050
PAUL: Yeah, I mean, some of the
feedback that we've had,

471
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,010
is that, actually, the user
interface didn't response,

472
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,290
especially for inline intent.

473
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,360
And for those of you who don't
know what inline kind of

474
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,220
intent is, it's the ability
to have like a pop-up that

475
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,270
appears, just over the context
that the user currently has

476
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,450
inside the browser.

477
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,430
So if they say, I'm going to
share a link from a blog, for

478
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,050
instance, you don't want to
necessarily be completely

479
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,760
redirected to another
application like Twitter or

480
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,520
Google+, or these
types of things.

481
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,720
You just want to appear it, like
how it appeared just over

482
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,770
the thing that you want
to share, right?

483
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,570
So the inline intent,
is that same thing.

484
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,700
And this is one of the areas
that we got a lot of feedback

485
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,990
from developers, at
the moment, is

486
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,930
that it looked rough.

487
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,600
Early, early I think is
the way of saying it.

488
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,470
ALEX: And we're definitely
working on

489
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,040
iterating on that design.

490
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,895
And we knew it was rough.

491
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,830
But we wanted to get in it in
the hands of developers, so

492
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,770
that they could start
using it.

493
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,550
PAUL: So, if you go to the
Chrome Canary channel now.

494
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,530
And fire the intent,
that is the share.

495
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,510
demos.webintents.org is a
good place to start &mdash;

496
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,640
you'll basically see,
the inline of

497
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
user and spaces changed.

498
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,630
So it's got this idea of, again,
constrained dialogue.

499
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,110
The idea being that the intent
picker itself can actually

500
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,010
adapt more freely to the user
interface, to the actual page

501
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,960
that's being displayed.

502
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,020
So the page that you've embeded
is 800 pixels wide,

503
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,450
the actual user interface, the
actual intent display, will

504
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,360
adapt to that 800 pixels.

505
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,360
So, it is being worked on,
and expect more changes.

506
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,560
ALEX: Expect a fair number
of more changes.

507
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,410
We're really working hard to
make this a really tight UI

508
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:14,990
that's a pleasure
to work with.

509
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,960
PAUL: Yeah, I mean the success
of Web Intents is kind of

510
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,070
generally tied to
user experience.

511
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,740
So just the users need to be
comfortable with what they do

512
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,950
inside the browser.

513
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,990
And we are acutely aware of
this, and we are making

514
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,010
changes the accommodate
for that as well.

515
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,780
So, hopefully, that again, was
Glenn Johns, and he said &mdash;

516
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,710
Jen Johnes?

517
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,630
Don't worry about that, I've got
spoonerisms on my brain.

518
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,830
So the next question.

519
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,650
As a user, how can I find
possible varieties for any

520
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,720
given intent?

521
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,280
Is that something third parties
can do to catalog

522
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,950
providing of different
intents?

523
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,440
ALEX: Before you answer that
question, I just want to point

524
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,830
out too, just so just for
people who aren't aware.

525
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,240
When you fire a Web Intent as a
developer, Chrome Web Store,

526
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,040
what we do write down today,
is if the user doesn't have

527
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,160
any Web apps installed that can
handle that intent, then

528
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,430
we show actually a list of
apps that can handle that

529
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,800
intent from the Web Store.

530
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,006
So this is a natural way that
even if you fire an intent,

531
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:10,720
even if the users don't have
anything installed, they are

532
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,830
going to still find applications
really easily

533
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,770
that can handle that intent.

534
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,370
PAUL: So, yeah that, actually,
pretty much answers part of

535
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,300
the question.

536
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,740
It's completely possible, for,
if the user agent wants to

537
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,960
implement intents, that they
might have their own directory

538
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,210
of intents themselves.

539
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,720

540
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,680
This, actually, brings up an
interesting question about why

541
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,990
we went to the Intents
side, right?

542
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,830
So, for me, right now,
we have to use that

543
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,940
manifest inside Chrome.

544
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,360
So you have a Chrome
applicational extension, which

545
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,590
has, basically, a small piece of
what essentially amounts to

546
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,940
JavaScript inside the manifest
that describes exactly what

547
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,880
your application does.

548
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,950
It says my application can share
links or edit images.

549
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,645
So the interesting thing, just
generally, is that the Chrome

550
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:00,640
actual manifest itself is
very specific to Chrome.

551
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,120
And when we've been talking
about Web Intents publicly,

552
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,350
generally is, you know, we're
really kind of keen on this

553
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,680
idea of an intent tag.

554
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,800
You know, a very small piece of
HTML that can live inside

555
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,990
applications, web applications,
on the web, that

556
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,410
actually describe the
capabilities of the URL.

557
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,020
What it enables you to do is
things like search engines,

558
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,250
for instance, who come along
and start to understand the

559
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,340
capabilities of the apps,
so that they could offer

560
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,430
suggestions for the user.

561
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,030
If they, for instance, maybe
search on the open web

562
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,690
image-editing applications,
right?

563
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,590
So, it's kind of cool.

564
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,590
And at the same time, it's
because it's a tag

565
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,750
indiscriminable on the open web,
any third party system

566
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,690
could come along, scrape
the contents and

567
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,700
provide that directory.

568
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,490
So I'm not going to say open
intents.org are going to do

569
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,840
this, because we haven't spoken
of this just yet.

570
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,120
But you know, they could go
along and start cataloging the

571
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,130
intents that have been
discovered on the open web,

572
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,990
which can provide extra
directory services,

573
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,100
so you can go in &mdash;

574
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,020
ALEX: Yeah, the community here
is really going to be really

575
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,040
key in helping evolve how to
use Web Intents, and how to

576
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,690
catalog which events
are available.

577
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,690
And the internet tag
is really key.

578
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,300
So today we're using the Chrome
Web Store as an natural

579
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,170
directory of stores
of applications

580
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,710
that can handle intents.

581
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,270
But that's the temporary
solution.

582
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,280
We were working in this with
W3C in this standardization

583
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,780
process to find a way for just
normal web pages to be able to

584
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,930
say, hey, I can handle
that intent.

585
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,090
PAUL: Yes, and the application
capabilities should just be

586
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,920
available on the web
just generally.

587
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,980
ALEX: Yeah, absolutely.

588
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,200
There's one other thing I wanted
to say, which is, an

589
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,150
important part about Web
Intents, I think, is Web

590
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,960
Intents is basically the
plumbing that allows you to

591
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,620
connect up to not to know
whether or not they're

592
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,210
connecting up to, and for Chrome
or the browser to help

593
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,610
initiate that connection.

594
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,150
Once you have that, how you talk
over that connection, is

595
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,410
to some extent, up to the

596
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,580
conventions that you're following.

597
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,180
It's just going to be really,
really important for the

598
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,740
community to be actively
involved in helping us define,

599
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,470
as a community, what the right
conventions are to be speaking

600
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,150
over this channel, that Web
Intents allows you to create.

601
00:22:59,150 --> 00:22:59,620
PAUL: Yeah.

602
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,650
So, yeah.

603
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,906
There goes the point we've got,
I think we've defined

604
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:06,540
five, six, different actions &mdash;
the ability to share data,

605
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,900
edit data, pick data from a
service, save out to a remote

606
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,580
service, and view as well.

607
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,620
So they'll be able to say, look,
my application can just

608
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,680
view images, or view videos.

609
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,170
This is just a very small set
of common actions that we

610
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,850
believe are on the open
web right now that

611
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,230
people are kind of using.

612
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,640
But there might be use cases,
for instance, payments, i

613
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,850
think is one, for instance.

614
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,340
And authentication ware.

615
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,290
You know, we haven't
said that we don't

616
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,840
find our intents directly.

617
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,470

618
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,130
We haven't said we don't
find them in like the

619
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,980
webintents.org area, because
this is open and discoverable,

620
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,930
people should just be able to
go and say, well I want to

621
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,540
start experimenting with
the ability to manage

622
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,300
payments on the web.

623
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,250
Fire Intents.

624
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,360
And then applications get
built from there.

625
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,550
But it all depends on great

626
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,790
documentation in the community.

627
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,860
I mean this is what
we found out.

628
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,310
When I first started with this
kind of whole idea is we

629
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,370
wanted the URL for the action
because we can describe

630
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,600
documentation for some of
the best practices.

631
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,750
And, actually, when you speak to
developers, they want even

632
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,720
more documentation, even more
guidance about exactly how

633
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,780
these actions should
be implemented.

634
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,720
And this is one of those things
that we're going to see

635
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,530
on the open web, as well, is
when people start building

636
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,670
their own intents, they'll
want great

637
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,180
documentation as well.

638
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,310
ALEX: Absolutely.

639
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,850
And we definitely want to help
the community be a part of

640
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,150
this, and help them find
how to use Web Intents.

641
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,660
The question was a
really great one.

642
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,510
There's so many use cases
for Web Intents.

643
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,750
I'm so excited to see what the
community is using this for

644
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,140
what, and what kinds of use
cases it wants to enable.

645
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,436
It's really exciting, I think.

646
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,830
PAUL: Yeah, thanks.

647
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,340
I went a little bit far against
that question, so

648
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,910
we'll move to the next
question at least.

649
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,870
How will Web Intents handle
verbs like edit, where the

650
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,590
application design would be
dependent on the context, as

651
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,170
on the file type, e.g. edit an
audio files, it's a song, I

652
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,540
want it to open Garage
Band versus the

653
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,140
general sound in Audacity?

654
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,260
ALEX: It's actually is
a great question.

655
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,970
PAUL: Yeah.

656
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,800
ALEX: So the insight is that
just because you have a

657
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,390
certain file type, you might
still want to open different

658
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:11,440
types of those files in
different applications, in

659
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:11,640
different contexts.

660
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,175
So, the example here is I've
got a sound file, it's

661
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:17,900
technically am MP3, but I want
to open it in Garage Band if

662
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,390
it's a song, versus I want to
open it in Audacity if it's &mdash;

663
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,660
PAUL: So, what is Audacity?

664
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,180
ALEX: Audacity, I believe,
is a cool sound editing

665
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,690
application.

666
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,570
PAUL: OK.

667
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,336
ALEX: I've never
used it myself.

668
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:29,930
I'm not [INAUDIBLE].

669
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,880
PAUL: So, we differentiate
between intents on the verb

670
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,100
and the data type
at the moment.

671
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,670
So, right now &mdash;

672
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,320

673
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,050
ALEX: I don't know how &mdash;

674
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,600
this is the kind of thing that
will be interesting to see how

675
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,450
the community addresses
this use case.

676
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,080
PAUL: I mean it'd be perfectly
possible for someone to do a

677
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,050
new edit intent.

678
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,070
I mean, we don't particularly
want to encourage that,

679
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,940
because, we think,
we've got a very

680
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,810
good generalized solution.

681
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,880
But this, I'll be honest, I
don't know how to quite answer

682
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,650
this right now.

683
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,660
But this is what we're trying
to discuss on the Public

684
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,162
Intents groups on the
webintentsdiscus

685
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,412
s@googlegroups.com.

686
00:26:05,412 --> 00:26:08,060

687
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,510
These are the things that we
want to try to find out,

688
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,850
because if it turns out there's
a compelling need for

689
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,510
editing different types of image
files or different types

690
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:21,520
of audio files in the context
of an application, then we

691
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,310
might need to provide some
better solution.

692
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,800
I mean, suggestions is one area,
but the developer might

693
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,780
say, look, we want to guide the
user down using Audacity

694
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,370
or Garage Band for one
type of application.

695
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,470
Suggestions looks like it might
handle some of that that

696
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,880
use case, but it's not going
to help filter what

697
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,600
applications you would have
got to install that handle

698
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,870
those types of data types &mdash;

699
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,450
ALEX: So, again, Web Intents
is pretty malleable.

700
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,130
So you could use its potential
in the future if the community

701
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,980
as a whole decides, hey the edit
intent isn't expressive

702
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,860
enough, I have a different
kind of edit.

703
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,840
Then, maybe it makes sense to
creative different intent.

704
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,690
We want, definitely, encourage
the community always to keep

705
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,730
the number of intents small.

706
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,650
As the smaller of intents we
have, the more sharing there

707
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,620
can be, the more interaction
the can be among apps.

708
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,750
But every so often there will be
a compelling use case, that

709
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,445
means a new intent.

710
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:14,785
And as a community, we'll need
to experiment with that and

711
00:27:14,785 --> 00:27:16,040
figure out what's the
right answer.

712
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,160
In this case, one thing to keep
in mind, is that when a

713
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,150
user hits the edit button,
they probably know what

714
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:22,810
their action is.

715
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,790
Like they know, oh, I want to
edit this song right now.

716
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:31,110
To some extent, if they see both
Audacity and Garage Band

717
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,350
in their picker, than they
probably know, oh I'm editing

718
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,620
music file, the task I'm
doing right now.

719
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,260
So they might not actually
even need &mdash;

720
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,083
ALEX: Yeah, they've
got the choice

721
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:41,700
themselves to do this, right?

722
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,180
So, they can chose that.

723
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,870
ALEX: That's a great question.

724
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,660
It was from Jay in Boston.

725
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,730
PAUL: So, Glenn Johns from
Brighton, hello again.

726
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,010
What are your first thoughts on
Ian Hickson's proposal for

727
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,540
merging Web Intents with
register to handle APIs with

728
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,335
Mozilla web activities?

729
00:27:57,335 --> 00:28:00,430

730
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,820
ALEX: So, Ian Hickson is the
editor of the HTML5 spec on

731
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,560
[INAUDIBLE], and he recently
posted a proposal that sort of

732
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,810
takes the Web Intents idea and
merges it in with similar

733
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,530
proposal from Mozilla
and other ideas.

734
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,930
So, one of the things to keep
mind about these kinds of

735
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,620
discussions and standards, and
we're trying to collectively

736
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,490
define a new standard, there is
lots of discussion, there's

737
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,900
lots of changing how you
think about things.

738
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,280
And we really are hoping that
something we think [INAUDIBLE]

739
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,990
Web Intents it is really
important.

740
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,020
But it is, of course,
experimental at this point.

741
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,240
And so if, ultimately, as a
community, in the standards

742
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,524
body, if we need to go in
different directions, we are,

743
00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:40,670
of course, open to that.

744
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,130
And so we're looking forward
to working with Ian and

745
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,485
Mozilla and others to really
define this spec

746
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:46,620
the best it can be.

747
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,010
This very basic functionality.

748
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,490
So that's a very general answer,
but where I'm really

749
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,835
excited to see so much
interaction from other browser

750
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,000
vendors as well, in
this process.

751
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,450
And it really shows that this
is an important problem that

752
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,710
we all want to solve.

753
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,190
It's awesome.

754
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,860
PAUL: The solution is generally
the same as well.

755
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,880
So, the next question, which
is by x, but I think I know

756
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,200
who asked this one.

757
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,650
Mike [? Marnov, ?]

758
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,200
I think.

759
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,060
So, for the sharing intent,
which is webintents.org/share

760
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,480
at the moment, is it enough to
add Web Intents support via

761
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,300
Adthis integration?

762
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,690
So, Adthis is a service that
aggregates the ability to

763
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,030
share your pieces of data
across, I think up to 300

764
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,150
different types of networks.

765
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,350
ALEX: It's a lot.

766
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,080
PAUL: And they've done a lot
hard work to actually

767
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,230
integrate these networks
into a very

768
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,320
common generalized solution.

769
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,690
And the really cool thing is
that they've actually taken

770
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,390
Web Intents on quite early, and
provided an integration in

771
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,200
their that little widget that
you put on the page.

772
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,860
Which will fire an intent.

773
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:54,210
So there's an issue, which is
the Web Intents logo, which I

774
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:54,840
gave to them.

775
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,340
Which doesn't well describe
exactly what Web Intents is.

776
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,340
So that's hopefully going
to change soon.

777
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,530
But generally, to this question,
if you've already

778
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,000
gotten Adthis widget on your
page, it makes perfect sense

779
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,652
just to keep it on, because they
aggregate across a whole

780
00:30:09,652 --> 00:30:11,430
lot of different networks.

781
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,860
One of the things that we've
seen with some people that

782
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,480
we've worked with recently is
that when they integrate share

783
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,730
intent they might have a
direct integration with

784
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,170
already, let's say Facebook,
and Twitter.

785
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,770
And what you aren't going to
find is that they have all the

786
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,550
rest of the services.

787
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,880
And all the rest of the services
is generally provided

788
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,210
by Web Intents.

789
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,040
So, that's what we're seeing
at the moment.

790
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,110
I wouldn't get rid of your
Adthis integration at all,

791
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,800
they provide a very valuable
service as well as it's not

792
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,013
just the ability to share with
the different networks.

793
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:41,720
It's the ability to get metrics,
on like page views,

794
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,380
and also kind of the types of
networks that your data and

795
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,500
your users and viewers
are sharing data to.

796
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,070
ALEX: And ultimately, Adthis
was created to come up to

797
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,290
solve a problem.

798
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,686
A very real problem, that
also Web Intents is

799
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:54,310
trying to solve as well.

800
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,060
And I think, Adthis adds a lot
of cool functionality, as

801
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,350
well, but Web Intents does
address some of these issues.

802
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,870
So, if you already have
Adthis it's great.

803
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,995
It's really simple to switch
to their Web Intents

804
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:05,350
[INAUDIBLE].

805
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,020
PAUL: And they already provide
support for Web Intents as

806
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,830
well, so it's &mdash;

807
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,580
ALEX: But Yeah it's
really cool again.

808
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,700
A lot of people trying to solve
the same basic problems

809
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,020
is showing there's
a real need here.

810
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,730
PAUL: I think the interesting
thing, because Web Intents is

811
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,230
quite generalized, they ability
to share something

812
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,735
normally is links.

813
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:23,630
But If you look at some
different services, like

814
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,350
Tumbler, for instance,
they share quotes.

815
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,430
You can select a piece
of text, and

816
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,820
share that single quote.

817
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,610
And how that actually works with
the generalized solutions

818
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,670
that isn't Web Intents,
is pretty hard, right.

819
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,120
So, when you look at different
services, and different things

820
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
that are going to come
in the future.

821
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,370
You might want to share an
image, you might want to share

822
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,810
a video, like a physical
video file.

823
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:46,110
You might want to share a
document type, which is very

824
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,920
uncommon, but very specific
to the kind of

825
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,950
workflows that you use.

826
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,050
Whether it's a Word document,
a Google Doc, all these

827
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,910
different types of things.

828
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,700
Actually, providing the widget
based system is pretty hard.

829
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,010
So, we believe, Web Intents
in this case would be &mdash;

830
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,050
that's where it comes
into its element.

831
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,660
You can share URL types of
data, with services that

832
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,540
support the same
type of thing.

833
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,465
ALEX: Yeah, so it's not going to
that it is more useful for

834
00:32:08,465 --> 00:32:11,230
other types of use cases that
aren't directly addressed by

835
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,590
Adthis as well.

836
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,091
PAUL: This is a question
from Lynn in Shanghai.

837
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:19,070
If a website uses JavaScript
shim to register the handler

838
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,350
by intent tags, can Chrome
invoke the handler natively

839
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,730
without the JavaScript shim?

840
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:28,020
OK so, a little bit of
information about the

841
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,870
JavaScript shim.

842
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,830
So the JavaScript shim is
designed to replicate the

843
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,400
functionality of Web Intents
in browsers that don't

844
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,140
actually support Web
Intents natively.

845
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,150

846
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:42,730
So right now, that is native
spot inside Chrome.

847
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,690
Chrome has the code available
to actually register the

848
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,930
intent tag natively,
however the

849
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,390
functionality is turned off.

850
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,036
So what it actually means is if
a page detects the intent

851
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:55,380
tag, it won't do anything.

852
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,406
If the browser detects the
intent tag it won't do

853
00:32:57,406 --> 00:32:58,780
anything at the moment.

854
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,600
This also means the same for
the JavaScript shim because

855
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,470
the JavaScript shim just
delegates functionality

856
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,910
straight to the browser if it
detects a native functionality

857
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,240
is already in place.

858
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,701
So right now, if the browser
detects the shim, in Chrome at

859
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:12,790
least, it won't do anything.

860
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,500
If it has JavaScript shim,
that's already been detected

861
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,550
and it's inside browser like
Firefox, or Opera, or Internet

862
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,450
Explorer, then they are just
going to be be registered in

863
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,763
the kind of the shims
datastore at

864
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:23,900
least at the moment.

865
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,550
So, we don't have that bridge,
we don't have that way of

866
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,840
converting users directly from &mdash;
you know, if you've

867
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,340
used the shim in Chrome before,
[INAUDIBLE] natively,

868
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,850
to when we get that tech
support down the line.

869
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,220
So we don't have a great answer
of you on that one,

870
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,910
unfortunately.

871
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,985
But that's the state of what
it is at the moment.

872
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:46,715
I don't know if there is
anything else to add.

873
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:47,990
I believe, so &mdash;

874
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,890
ALEX: Next three.

875
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,330
PAUL: Yeah.

876
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:52,150
Did we miss any from before?

877
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,950
Sorry about this, I'm not in
presentation mode for the

878
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,800
moderator questions.

879
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,010
So, here we go.

880
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,030
Page load.

881
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,990
ALEX: Did you click on it?

882
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,460
ALEX: I might have
clicked on it.

883
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,430
I didn't click on it.

884
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,030
OK.

885
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,490
So to what extent can OS
native non-browser

886
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,476
applications hook into
Web Intents?

887
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:12,230

888
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,000
It's a very good question.

889
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,370
Right now, none.

890
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,250
But that doesn't mean that
we can't do this.

891
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,510
If the browser can provide a
hook into its registration

892
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,190
system, then that's something
that could be

893
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,480
supported in future.

894
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,489
It just requires vendor
support and external

895
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:26,310
application support.

896
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,750
ALEX: This is another
great example.

897
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,989
There's tons of possibilities
for Web Intents in the future.

898
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:33,570
Right now, we're focusing on
web app to web app, but

899
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,420
there's obviously tons of
opportunity for doing things.

900
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,020
From web app to browser,
browser to web app.

901
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,159
Web app to native app.

902
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,020
Within Android &mdash;

903
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,280
PAUL: What about external
devices?

904
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,345
ALEX: There's all kinds of
different connections that Web

905
00:34:46,345 --> 00:34:48,199
Intents could help be
the broker between.

906
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,270
So this is another great example
of something that we

907
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:50,889
love to do.

908
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,480
And it is a cool idea.

909
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,120
And we aren't looking at it
actively right now, but that

910
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,300
just because we're focusing on
really nailing that basic

911
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,730
functionality of web
app to web app.

912
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,250
PAUL: I believe this is
the last question.

913
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,760
And it's actually for me to
repeat the different types of

914
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,850
intents that we have.

915
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:10,250
So Wes Short from Shasta
Lake, in California.

916
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,780
Hello, thank you for
your question.

917
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,650
It's one of the six
data intents

918
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,710
you've identified again?

919
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,480
So, basically we've identified
six types of intents, six

920
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,700
actions that users will perform
commonly across the

921
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,080
web that we believe should be
built-in support to the API.

922
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,985
ALEX: I should point out,
built-in does not mean it's

923
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:32,600
actually specified in
a specification.

924
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,440
It just means that these are
the default actions that we

925
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,850
think user of this API and most
likely want us to build

926
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,630
consensus around.

927
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,600
PAUL: So, the first is share.

928
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,250
The interesting thing about
share is that it's not just

929
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,870
about sharing links, it's about
share any type of data.

930
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,240
So the ability to send some data
from one application to

931
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,990
another to &mdash;

932
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,030
like send and image.

933
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,110
So we actually used this at
Google I/O. Our example was

934
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,110
it's really hard to actually
share an image on the web

935
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,030
today to a remote application,
well, like a remote web

936
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,010
application, like Gmail
for instance.

937
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,410
We have mailto.

938
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,240
Mailto Is a protocol
on the web.

939
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,390
So basically, when we need to
send an email, and what

940
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,060
happens, when you click on the
web today is you click mailto,

941
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,595
it'll open up your preferred
application, I believe we've

942
00:36:17,595 --> 00:36:19,090
got it in Gmail support.

943
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,440
And you have encode the data
in a very specific way.

944
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,460
The title to, person to,
the title of the

945
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,150
email, and the body.

946
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,490
But what it neglects to do is
actually, well, most people

947
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,030
want to share not just this
very basic kind of email &mdash;

948
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,750
ALEX: Text.

949
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,540
PAUL: Yeah, text.

950
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,400
They want to share images.

951
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,010
They want to share videos
and all the stuff.

952
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,280
They want to share
links as well.

953
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,008
Links that they find
on the web.

954
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:43,310
And the idea behind the share
intent, is that you can say in

955
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,430
your application, and our
image maker application

956
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,730
example, which we could have
shown today, if it wasn't for

957
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:52,420
me, has the ability to share
this image out to different

958
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,100
types of networks and support
sharing images very

959
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,260
specifically.

960
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,210
And what this enables you to
do in the future would be,

961
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,550
say, well, I'm want to share out
to Twitter by, say, Imgur,

962
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:05,160
which is the integration I've
put in as an example.

963
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,720
Images supported challenges to
deliver the data of that image

964
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,910
to that application.

965
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,920
So we have share.

966
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,220
It's not just about
sharing text.

967
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,260
It's about the ability to share
images, the ability to

968
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,195
share videos, any type of
data that you want.

969
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:21,220
You can be be very specific
about and pass it out.

970
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,350
The next is edit.

971
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,750
The reason why this, I think,
edit is kind of important, and

972
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,290
we need to talk about it a
little bit more, is because

973
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,160
you have data in one
application.

974
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,680
And you want to get in to say
your image manipulation

975
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,690
application.

976
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,360
You may want to put a funny
text or a funny

977
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,660
caption on the image.

978
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,300
Today right now, unless you've
got a very deep integration

979
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,180
with a third party system, the
user has to right click on the

980
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,310
image in the browser, download
it to the desktop, upload to

981
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,510
the image editing application,
change the image inside the

982
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,600
image editing application, then
right click on it to save

983
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,210
it, download it back to the
desktop, and then try to

984
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,570
upload it back into the app.

985
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,330
ALEX: You know, it's funny, Is
when I do that in practice, it

986
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:02,975
is just what you do.

987
00:38:02,975 --> 00:38:04,780
But when you describe it that
way, that's insane.

988
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,510
PAUL: Yes, yes.

989
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,970
That's crazy.

990
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,620
So, the idea behind edit is you
just say, I need to edit

991
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,430
this image.

992
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,280
And edit, you find the
applications that supports

993
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,845
image editing, sends the data to
it, and then, once the user

994
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:18,420
has finished editing the data
inside the application, they

995
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,560
can just return that data
back to the corner.

996
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,885
So the data just lives inside
the browser, is transferred

997
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:23,910
from browser.

998
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,680
Browser [INAUDIBLE] to
browser [INAUDIBLE].

999
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,562
Never really has to switch
the internet if it

1000
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:28,490
doesn't have to.

1001
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,670
And then you can edit, and
bring the data back in.

1002
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,396
And that's completely different
what we see on the

1003
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:33,540
web today at the moment.

1004
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,360
So, edit for me is
really important.

1005
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,530
The next, I'm going to skip
one.And that's on

1006
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,320
webintents.org documentation
for now, is pick.

1007
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,300
The reason why pick is kind of
cool is because we've got

1008
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,900
things like Google Drive,
Box, box.net.

1009
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,970
Dropbox and box.net,
for instance, these

1010
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,220
are all your clouds.

1011
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,990
All your files and stuff
are starting to live

1012
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,340
in the cloud, right.

1013
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,000
You don't want to have one
application, have one direct

1014
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,790
integration to the service that
you don't use, right?

1015
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,820
So the idea behind the Web
Intents is that you could say,

1016
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,750
I want to pick my file, my
image, my document from any of

1017
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,390
my cloud file storage solutions
and then bring it

1018
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,550
back into my application.

1019
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,155
And that's what the
pick intent does.

1020
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:16,900
You pick a file, or pick some
data from some service.

1021
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,650
The next is save.

1022
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,650
So the complementary service
to pick is save.

1023
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,050
So, you want to save an image,
something that you've edited

1024
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,030
on the web, or inside
a web application.

1025
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,280
Right now, if you're trying to
do a save, you only have to

1026
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,520
save to the file system.

1027
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,085
You either right click to save
direct, or maybe do some hack

1028
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:36,259
in Chrome to only anchor, to do
a download, and put in the

1029
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:37,240
downloads directory.

1030
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,410
It's pretty crazy, right?

1031
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:42,450
And save is designed to say,
well I picked from Google

1032
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,690
Drive, for instance, I don't
want to save it to Dropbox.

1033
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,570
So the idea is that you can
have these three service

1034
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,420
integrated, not necessarily with
each other directly, but

1035
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,100
you can pull from one service,
edit the data in another app,

1036
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,730
and send it back out.

1037
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,640
So pick is to pull data in, and
save is to push data out

1038
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,070
that you've just edited,
for instance.

1039
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,310
We have also view.

1040
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,530
So view is kind of interesting,
right?

1041
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,610
Most people don't think of this
on the web, probably,

1042
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,890
you're watching a YouTube
video and

1043
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,805
watching inside YouTube.

1044
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:12,440
Or you're watching video, or you
might watch inside Vimeo.

1045
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,420
But what do is you actually
have a video file that's

1046
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,880
either been sent you via email
or it's on your desktop and

1047
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,910
you want to view it inside, like
a special kind of video

1048
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,110
viewing piece of software.

1049
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,370
You're not necessarily going to
upload it to one of these

1050
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,030
kind of video services just
to go and view the video.

1051
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,380
You might just want to view
inside your web app.

1052
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,710
And we don't see many web
applications today which are

1053
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,840
just dedicated to viewing
file types.

1054
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,270
We just don't see them at
all, I don't think.

1055
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,570
And the view intent is
designed to save up.

1056
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,810
You know if Chrome detects that
you, for instance, that

1057
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,030
you've downloaded a video.

1058
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,850
I mean, this functionality
is not there, just yet.

1059
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,530
But if Chrome has detected that
you've just downloaded a

1060
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,960
video, why not try to view
the video inside the web

1061
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,900
application that is
on the web today.

1062
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,820
So view, is, I think, is
a pretty important one.

1063
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,420
I think it's quite important
for things like Chrome

1064
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,200
[INAUDIBLE] as well where
literally all your

1065
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,860
applications just
live on the web.

1066
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,870
ALEX: But this is a great meta
point too that there are

1067
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,790
things that you do today that
are sort of annoying to do,

1068
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,620
there are other things
you don't do

1069
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,920
today, because you can't.

1070
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,090
PAUL: Yes.

1071
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,940
ALEX: So Web Intents enables
new types of integrations

1072
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,990
between apps that couldn't
exist before.

1073
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,810
So, that's one of the reasons
that I guarantee that this

1074
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,150
list that we've got here is
going to have things added to

1075
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,220
it, as people actually use Web
Intents and realize what the

1076
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,480
full potential of this kind
of technology is.

1077
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,202
PAUL: Yeah, people have been
talking about things like a

1078
00:41:29,202 --> 00:41:30,600
pay intent, for instance, if you
want to buy some goods on

1079
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,710
the web, using a preferred
merchant.

1080
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,230
Like merchant record.

1081
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,500
So, yeah, these things that we
are not even thinking about

1082
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,120
properly just yet, which people
can start and develop.

1083
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,000
So, I think, view is kind
important as well, I say kind

1084
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,850
of, it's very important.

1085
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,180
We do actually have view
slightly integrated into

1086
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,200
Chrome at the moment.

1087
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,250
So if you download an RSS feed
or and Atom feed, you'll be

1088
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,610
presented with a list
of services

1089
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,640
that can support that.

1090
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,632
I think it's only in Canary and
dev, I don't think it's in

1091
00:41:56,632 --> 00:41:58,210
stable just yet.

1092
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:00,980
So this is one of those things
once the user interface on the

1093
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,050
flow gets a little bit better,
we're going to start seeing

1094
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,400
these things roll out
a little bit more.

1095
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,850
But, yeah, you can view RSS
feeds and Atom feeds in your

1096
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,100
preferred application.

1097
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,590
And one of those applications
can actually just be the

1098
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,250
browser with their XML view.

1099
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,200
And the last one we've
got documents is and

1100
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,980
intent called subscribe.

1101
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,200
The idea behind this is if
you're on a page, you want to

1102
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,400
subscribe to say an RSS feed,
or changes to the state of

1103
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,110
that page inside your preferred
application.

1104
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,000
So you might not only view an
RSS feed in a specialized

1105
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,450
reader or a special view, but
you might have it subscribed

1106
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,880
in a different type
of application.

1107
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,530
And one of the guys who've
have implemented this is

1108
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,900
Message Boy.

1109
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,440
I checked it out on the Web
Store at the moment, because

1110
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,020
they have the subscribe intent
already built in, which just

1111
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,910
basically allows you to say,
look, I'm going to subscribe

1112
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,600
to changes in this RSS feed.

1113
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,590
And to add this application is
going to do something that is

1114
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,522
not normally just like a view.

1115
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:54,020
It's going to aggregate the data
and do things behind the

1116
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,770
scenes that normal view
intents wouldn't do.

1117
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,400
So, subscribe is actually
kind of interesting.

1118
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,050
It's pretty cool.

1119
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,210
Yeah, that's it.

1120
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,100
They're the six core ones that
we've defined so far.

1121
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,410
ALEX: And again, these are
not built into the spec.

1122
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,330
It's up to the communities
to find and standardize

1123
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,420
themselves around which of
these intents are useful,

1124
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,580
which of the action types and
to find new ones, and find

1125
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,778
exactly precisely what
they mean and when

1126
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:19,510
they should be used.

1127
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,920
ALEX: Yeah and to check these
out today the simplest thing

1128
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,350
to do is go to webintents.org
forward slash verb thing.

1129
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:32,930
So it's webintents.org/share
or /edit, /pick.

1130
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,130
What happened there is because
we're trying to document best

1131
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,260
practices quite concisely is
that we are going put all the

1132
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,120
best practices guidance,
example code, of how to

1133
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,210
integrate maybe the share
action, or the pick action

1134
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,820
into your applications, both
from a client, and a service

1135
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,610
point of view.

1136
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,340
So if you're a service that
wants to provide data to

1137
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,630
clients, you can say, well, I
need to implement the pick, I

1138
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,220
need to implement the pick
for my type of data.

1139
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,640
How do I go about doing it.

1140
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,523
You go to webintents.org/pick
and then we'll try to provide

1141
00:44:01,523 --> 00:44:03,580
you with the best guidance
possible &mdash;

1142
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,980
ALEX: And we're really working
to improve that as well to

1143
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,700
make sure that it's useful, has
all the best practices.

1144
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,690
It's a place that the community
can work together to

1145
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:15,020
figure out, to define what
the best practices are.

1146
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:15,940
PAUL: Yeap, Cool.

1147
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,940
So, I think that's all the
questions that we've had.

1148
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,210
We do have a weird question at
the end that just looks like

1149
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,150
some random text &mdash;

1150
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,710
ALEX: Yeah, so won't
answer that one.

1151
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,560
PAUL: Well, I can speak
random if you want.

1152
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,080
Yeah, so this was our first Web

1153
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,440
Intents livestream Hangout.

1154
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,500
I'd be really interested to get
the feelers out there to

1155
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,860
see what kind of stuff
that you want to

1156
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,900
hear us talk about.

1157
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,690
ALEX: Absolutely.

1158
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,830
PAUL: I don't want to do it
weekly, because we're quite

1159
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,620
early on in this
whole process.

1160
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,290
I want to aggregate the best
things that happen around the

1161
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,610
web, so we can present
them to you.

1162
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,160
But also, at the same time, If
you have any kind of things

1163
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,600
that you want me to talk about,
get some engineers.

1164
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,130
I haven't asked the
engineers yet.

1165
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,200
So we've got a couple of
engineers over in America who

1166
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,100
are actually working on this
project at the moment.

1167
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,850
We can get these in as well,
and talk to them, get some

1168
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,620
feedback from you guys.

1169
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,260
Hopefully, we'll have a better
Hangout as well, so they can

1170
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,550
invite their parties
into it as well.

1171
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,460
ALEX: So, everything in Web
Intents is really up to the

1172
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,820
community to help figure
out how should we

1173
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,260
be doing these Hangouts.

1174
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,900
How webintents.org
should work.

1175
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,700
How to use this API.

1176
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,046
And sort of feeding back in to
make sure we're designing it

1177
00:45:29,046 --> 00:45:32,020
in the best possible way.

1178
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,860
PAUL: Yeah, so cool.

1179
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,940
I think, we're done.

1180
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,390
So what I'm going to do as well,
and I encourage everyone

1181
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,440
to, well, not everyone to do,
I'm going to share a whole lot

1182
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,850
of links, you can share
links if you want.

1183
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,886
I'm going to share a whole lot
of links on our Web Intents

1184
00:45:43,886 --> 00:45:45,530
Google+ page.

1185
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,220
I encourage everyone to try
and follow that, because

1186
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,600
that's where our centralized
communication channel, of

1187
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,490
pushing out updates
and everything is.

1188
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:53,840
ALEX: Following all this
stuff is hard.

1189
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,950
If you try to follow the spec
discussions on W3C, there are

1190
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,780
a lot of very smart, very
technical people having very

1191
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,440
interesting and complicated
discussions.

1192
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,600
And as a web developer, I just
want to summarize it for you.

1193
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,800
So Web Intents Google + pages
are a great place to follow in

1194
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,930
a more summarized way, easier
to consume way.

1195
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,360
To know what's going on.

1196
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,410
PAUL: Cool.

1197
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:18,700
So thank you very much
for your questions.

1198
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
I'll be here again in
two weeks time.

1199
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,650
So, thank you very
much and goodbye.

1200
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:25,900
ALEX: Bye.

1201
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:31,270

1202
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,860
I'm not sure how we turn off.

1203
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,960
So stop streaming.

1204
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,510
ALEX: Good bye for real.

1205
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,760
PAUL: Good bye.

1206
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,060
