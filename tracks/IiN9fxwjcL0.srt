1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,200
Wilson: Hi. I'm Brett,
if you don't know me.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,634
Okay, so I'm gonna be
talking about...

3
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:09,267
Not working. Okay.

4
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,968
Okay. I'm gonna be talking
about the layers of our program.

5
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:14,434
Chrome is like an onion
or a parfait,

6
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:17,367
where there's many layers
that go deeper and deeper.

7
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:18,934
[laughs]

8
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:20,234
Onion parfait.

9
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:21,634
So first I'm gonna show you

10
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:23,667
how to get to the information
that I'm gonna tell you

11
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:26,434
so you can look it up later when
you aren't watching the talk.

12
00:00:26,434 --> 00:00:29,133
So this is the Chromium
developer site

13
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,767
on dev.chromium.org.

14
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:32,868
And what you do is you first
click on For Developers,

15
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:34,367
'cause you're a developer.

16
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,968
And...the things
I'm gonna be discussing

17
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:40,934
are under the engineering
design docs here at the bottom.

18
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,901
So if you go to the engineering
design docs...

19
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:46,667
these first two things are
probably the most important.

20
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,467
So there's the Multi-process
Architecture

21
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:49,767
which Darin talked about,

22
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,901
and here it's got an overview
of everything.

23
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:54,701
If you're confused
about what Darin said,

24
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,300
this is a good place to start.

25
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,133
Um...the other thing
to look at is...

26
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,467
how Chromium displays
web pages,

27
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:04,801
which is what I'm gonna
be talking about today.

28
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,000
So it's got a discussion
of everything.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,634
You have diagrams
and stuff like that.

30
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:13,033
So this is one of the diagrams
from that page

31
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:15,000
that I'm gonna be discussing
a lot.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,300
So Dimitri just talked
about WebKit,

33
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,734
which is at the bottom.

34
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:20,801
That's kind of our low level
library that we use

35
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:22,634
for rendering web pages.

36
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:25,234
As he said,
that lives on webkit.org,

37
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:27,801
and if we change it,
you have to change it on WebKit,

38
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:30,467
and then we pull it
to our tree.

39
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:34,234
So historically we also
had a WebKit port,

40
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:37,267
and the WebKit port
provides integration

41
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:40,601
with the graphics layer
like Skia, system fonts,

42
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,601
the network.

43
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:43,901
And we've got our own
implementation

44
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:46,067
of all those things &mdash;
that's called our port.

45
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,701
And we've recently moved
our WebKit port

46
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,200
into the WebKit tree.

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,100
So that means anytime
you need to change something

48
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,734
with fonts or graphics,

49
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,534
you're gonna have to also
make it a patch to WebKit,

50
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,734
even though it only really
affects us right now.

51
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:00,734
So these two things,
both of them on WebKit,

52
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:03,634
and they cannot depend
on any other parts of Chrome.

53
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,334
Because they live
in WebKit's tree,

54
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,767
they should be able
to compile by themselves.

55
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,100
[clears throat]

56
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,100
So the next layer is
the WebKit glue

57
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,534
which we have in
our WebKit directory/glue.

58
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,634
And that kinda provides
a wrapper around WebKit

59
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:20,601
that we use to access it.

60
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,267
And so it does several things.

61
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,868
It provides, uh...
type independence.

62
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:28,067
So WebKit uses
its own string types,

63
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,968
its own URL types.

64
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:32,400
It has lots of dependencies
all over the place.

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,667
And we don't wanna have Chrome
inherit all that stuff,

66
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,667
'cause we're gonna be confused
with, you know,

67
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:39,133
ten different string types
and, uh, you know,

68
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,100
two URL classes.

69
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,868
So the WebKit glue's job
is to translate types

70
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:48,400
between, for example,
a GURL and a KURL...

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,367
Um...or a WebCore string
to a standard string.

72
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:57,133
And so it kind of provides
all the, uh...

73
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,901
an implementation
of all the interfaces

74
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:00,467
that WebKit uses.

75
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:04,734
So there might be a frame loader
client callback thing.

76
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,501
It will implement its own,

77
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,434
convert it to Google types,

78
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:11,100
and then it will have
its own callback interface

79
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,567
that you'll have to implement.

80
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,000
So there's kind of a hop
as you go across this boundary.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,501
And so if you do need
to get something...

82
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,267
if you're in our WebKit port

83
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,834
and you need to
get something from the browser,

84
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,634
like the browser process
or something higher level,

85
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:27,634
you actually have to go through
this delegate interface.

86
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:29,467
That hops through
to the WebKit glue,

87
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,400
and then that's implemented
at a higher level.

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,300
So the WebKit glue

89
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,868
shouldn't depend on
any other parts of Chrome.

90
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,501
It's basically
our embedding layer,

91
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,200
so you should be able
to write a new browser

92
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,434
using our WebKit glue,
totally different in every way.

93
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:45,934
And we have such a browser
called TestShell

94
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,934
which is a separate browser
that just uses our WebKit glue,

95
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:52,400
has its own simple front end,
and that's it.

96
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,167
So TestShell can't depend on
any other parts of Chrome

97
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,601
other than base.

98
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:00,000
So, um, here's our directory.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,033
So base here at the top
is kind of used by everything

100
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:05,501
except the WebCore code,
which obviously isn't ours.

101
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:08,701
So WebKit glue depends on this.

102
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:11,267
We've got our network library
that depends on this.

103
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:15,067
You know, we've got our sandbox
that depends on this.

104
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,267
But basically nothing else here
except Chrome

105
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,434
depends on anything but base.

106
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:22,300
So for example,
Net doesn't depend on

107
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,667
you know, Media or ICP
or Gears or Chrome.

108
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,133
And then Chrome kind of brings
all these things together

109
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,701
into the final product.

110
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:31,601
So hopefully, this makes it
easy for projects

111
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,667
to pick up
our different components

112
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,601
from these top level
directories.

113
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:39,334
They just have to take base
and the sandbox or whatever.

114
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:42,801
So um...

115
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:46,801
Okay, so WebKit glue depends
on base, and that's it.

116
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:49,767
So you can write
a new browser, um...

117
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:52,133
that's single process.

118
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,901
Or you can use our multi-process
embedding layer,

119
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:56,934
which is,
as Darin talked about,

120
00:04:56,934 --> 00:05:00,267
it's got the RenderProcess
and, uh &mdash;

121
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,934
okay, let me talk about that.
[laughs]

122
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:05,567
So the RenderProcess

123
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:08,701
is kind of implemented
in this render project

124
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,868
which is in Chrome/renderer.

125
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:13,300
So these are things like
RenderView and RenderWidget.

126
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,067
They're called Render.
Everything starts with Render.

127
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:19,801
And that talks to the
corresponding interfaces

128
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:21,567
on the browser side.

129
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,300
So each interface in Render
has a host

130
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,901
in the RenderHostDirectory

131
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,000
called RenderViewHost
or RenderWidgetHost.

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,634
So these two things
kinda go together.

133
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,400
They're both sides
of the pipe.

134
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,300
And if you wanna write
a multi-process browser,

135
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,000
you use this Renderer
host layer,

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,834
which is in
chrome browser/render_host.

137
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,000
And just like with glue,

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,434
it shouldn't depend
on other parts of Chrome.

139
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:45,133
So it shouldn't know anything
about our browser

140
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,467
or the fact that we have tabs
or anything like that.

141
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,033
And if you wanna write
a multi-process browser,

142
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:51,167
you should be able
to grab this layer

143
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,934
and you're, you know,
ready to go,

144
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:54,767
writing everything else
different.

145
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:58,434
Um...so we aren't
perfect in this respect.

146
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:01,267
Sometimes it has
some bad dependencies.

147
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,834
But please don't add more.

148
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,000
So one way to think
about this is, you know,

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,567
say you're writing
a dialogue box

150
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,934
that has a web page in it,

151
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,801
but it looks kinda like
a dialogue box.

152
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:13,267
You should be able to embed
this Render host,

153
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:15,901
like a RenderViewHost,
in that

154
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:17,601
and just kind of get
a web page.

155
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:20,067
It shouldn't have all these
things like a password manager

156
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:22,467
or history or anything
like that.

157
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,467
So if you're wondering
where to put stuff,

158
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,634
if you need it
in a dialogue box

159
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:28,667
or something very simple
like that, put it there.

160
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,400
If it depends
on other parts of Chrome,

161
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,100
put it in a higher level.

162
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,167
So the Renderer host
has a delegate interface

163
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:39,067
which is how it talks
with the higher levels.

164
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,267
So that's implemented
of our tab contents layer.

165
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,267
And that's kind of the layer
that really integrates

166
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:45,300
with the rest
of the browser services.

167
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,467
So for example,
it talks to history,

168
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:51,467
it talks to, you know,
the password manager,

169
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,567
the navigation list
for back/forward

170
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:54,868
and all that stuff.

171
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,868
So tab contents kinda brings
everything together.

172
00:06:56,868 --> 00:07:01,267
And, uh, above the tab contents
is the browser window.

173
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:04,033
So you shouldn't ever be
talking up directly,

174
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,367
so tab contents
has a tab contents delegate

175
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,234
that browser window implements.

176
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,501
And in fact,
other parts of our system

177
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:14,067
actually use tab contentses that
aren't their browser window.

178
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,534
So you shouldn't ever
depend on, you know,

179
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,100
being in a browser window.

180
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,901
So you talk up
through your delegate

181
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,667
to talk to the browser
window.

182
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,167
The browser window
has the tab strip,

183
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:26,033
manages tab switching,
stuff like that.

184
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,300
So obviously,
it's easy to talk down.

185
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,334
The browser window
can talk to any of its tabs.

186
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,834
The tab contents
can talk to the Renderer host.

187
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,267
These talk to glue,
and glue talks to WebKit.

188
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:40,200
And one of the things
we have on the buildbot is...

189
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,300
this check deps...
which is not here.

190
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,968
It was on the old build.

191
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,901
How do we get to the old build?
Does anybody know?

192
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:52,100
Oh, the old buildbot?

193
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,033
Okay, anyway, so there's
one step with the build.

194
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,734
This has check deps.

195
00:07:56,734 --> 00:08:01,968
Man: Waterfall...[indistinct]

196
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:04,200
Wilson: Um...so this
check deps

197
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,467
tries to enforce
that you don't include

198
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,300
files from other parts
of the project

199
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,767
that you're not supposed to.

200
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,434
So...let's see.

201
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,801
Okay, so here, one of the first
steps on the main buildbot,

202
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,133
it updates and then it runs
through this check deps program.

203
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:25,934
So if you ever see
check deps go red,

204
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:28,734
that means that your change,
you know, for example,

205
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:31,501
included something
that it wasn't supposed to

206
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:34,133
like made a dependency
from the network library

207
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,834
to Chrome.

208
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:39,033
So if this ever goes red,
you need to back out your change

209
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,934
or fix it really fast.

210
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:44,033
Uh...not...not just make it
so that

211
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,067
inclusion doesn't break
the build.

212
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,100
'Cause that is telling you that
you're not supposed to do that.

213
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,000
To try to kinda
keep us honest.

214
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,334
And it's got a &mdash;

215
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,601
if you have any questions,
you can ask me about that.

216
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,968
It's got files in each
directory that kinda show...

217
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:00,067
oh, files in this directory
are allowed to

218
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,434
include base and net
but nothing else.

219
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,734
So there's kind of a set
of hierarchical rules

220
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:07,434
that it uses.

221
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:09,400
And...
that's my whole talk.

222
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,834
Anybody have any questions?

223
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:16,801
Peter: How does Darin's
rewritten Chromium port

224
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,334
affect all this stuff?

225
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:19,667
Wilson: I'm--I don't know.

226
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,601
Uh, Peter's asking

227
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:25,868
how Darin's rewritten Chromium
port in WebKit affects this.

228
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:29,601
I think it will go kind of
in-between glue and WebKit.

229
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,834
It's kind of--it will be using
WebKit type,

230
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:34,367
so we'll still need a glue layer
to convert types.

231
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,033
But it would be a more
stable API,

232
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,534
because right now WebKit glue

233
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:40,067
kinda talks to these
crazy WebKit classes

234
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,968
that change every day
and causes such problems.

235
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:47,234
But I haven't seen it.
[laughs]

236
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,601
Peter: Is it feasible
someday to pull out

237
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:53,334
like the Renderer host
into source/rendererhost

238
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:56,033
or something above Chrome
if it's supposed to be

239
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,767
kind of like a usable
embedding layer?

240
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,267
Wilson: Peter asked if he
could pull Renderer host

241
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,868
out of the Chrome browser
directory.

242
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,834
Maybe we haven't had
a need for that.

243
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,534
But it would be nice
if we were able to

244
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,200
and it had like
no dependencies.

245
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,100
But it does.

246
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,734
Um...yeah.

247
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,901
I can't think of any reason
why it shouldn't be possible.

248
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:18,300
Peter: Then you have &mdash;
you could rename WebKit glue

249
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,601
to be like, you know,

250
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:22,033
single process embedding layer
as a thing,

251
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,467
and then this would be
multi-process if anything.

252
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:26,901
Wilson: Okay, Peter has
some crazy naming ideas.

253
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,434
[laughter]
Peter: Thank you.

254
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:31,968
Wilson: [laughing]

255
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:35,300
Any other questions?

256
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,501
Okay.

257
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,434
[applause]
