00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
JOSHUA MARANTZ: Good morning,
and welcome to

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,350
Make the Web Faster.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,580
Today we're going to bring you
three new technologies.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,920
My name is Joshua Marantz and
I'm going to talk about

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,660
mod_pagespeed, which is
an Apache module which

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,650
automatically rewrites
web pages to make

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,290
them display faster.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,720
Richard Rabbat will talk about
WebP, which is a new image

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,950
format for the web.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,340
And Hakon Wium Le will talk
about Opera and WebP.

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,190
So, why make your
website fast?

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,360
The benefits are many, among
them are user satisfaction &mdash;

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,620
people like to go to
fast website &mdash;

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,180
better engagement,
and more revenue.

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,620
But it's hard.

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,270
The techniques for improving
websites are reasonably

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,120
well-known, but they're
cumbersome

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,640
to implement manually.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,740
There's trade-offs to make.

21
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,360
There's the trade-off
of maintainability &mdash;

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,680
of being able to easily change
your website and maintain it &mdash;

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,170
versus keeping minified versions
and sprites of your

24
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,820
images and your text,
et cetera.

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,630
There's an agility trade-off,
because if you set your cache

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,490
lifetimes for a long time out,
it's very difficult to change

27
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,140
your JavaScript to fix bugs and
have it push out because

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,340
users' browsers have cached
in it an old version.

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,560
And if you set the
cache lifetime

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,110
short, you get agility.

31
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,000
But then everybody after they
come back to your site, if

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,040
they come back on a daily basis
they'll get a fresh

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,070
download each time.

34
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,410
So another aspect is that
browsers are moving forward at

35
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,590
a rapid pace.

36
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,270
New browsers have new techniques
that can help web

37
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,860
developers build faster
websites.

38
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,330
But the old browsers lack these
techniques, and you

39
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,530
don't want to leave all the
users who are stuck on old

40
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,660
browsers for various
reasons behind.

41
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,070
You want to continue to support
them well letting new

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,340
browsers exploit
the techniques.

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,860
So you kind of have to have some
server-side intelligence.

44
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,890
And we're discovering new
techniques all the time.

45
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,080
There's a talk later today about
mobile best practices.

46
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,295
And as these techniques are
learned and adopted adopted

47
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:02,370
and changed, you want to be able
to have a tool that helps

48
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,580
adopt your website, rather
than employing somebody

49
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,050
full-time to keep up with these
techniques and adjust

50
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,490
your website accordingly.

51
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,760
So the solution is to
use automated tools.

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,670
So this is what mod_pagespeed
is for.

53
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,340
Optimize your website without
having to change it.

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,330
You don't have to change the way
you generate content, you

55
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,690
don't have to minify your CSS
and your JavaScript by hand

56
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,970
and keep two versions
around, spriting

57
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,490
your images, et cetera.

58
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,480
You don't have to manually run
ImageMagick over your whole

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,535
library of photos and keep
two versions of those.

60
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,300
Get a machine to do
that for you.

61
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,750
That's what machines
are good at.

62
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,800
So what does mod_pagespeed do?

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,220
It actually does
no black magic.

64
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,570
the techniques for optimizing
webpages, there's basically

65
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,970
two bibles written by Steve
Souders: High Performance

66
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,510
Websites and Even
Faster Websites.

67
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,610
And they are pretty much the
techniques that we use today

68
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,570
in mod_pagespeed to make
your website faster.

69
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,850
Image compression, sizing images
to the right size,

70
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,130
minifying CSS, JavaScript,
and HTML.

71
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,640
We take small images that are
below a certain threshold and

72
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,650
inline them.

73
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,810
Same with CSS and JavaScript.

74
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,900
And probably most importantly,
we extend cache lifetimes, and

75
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,190
we'll talk more about.

76
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,990
All of these techniques
are listed.

77
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,410
We have a demo site called
modpagespeed.com, you go to

78
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,540
that site, it shows you every
optimization that we do,

79
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,850
documentation before
and after.

80
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,890
So here's one example we'll dive
into called combining CSS

81
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,400
files, so if you have four small
CSS files, each one of

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,070
these when it's rendered in a
browser would represent a

83
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,730
separate HTTP request. For all
kinds of reasons it's better

84
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,840
to bundle these into one file
and this is not very hard to

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,210
do by hand, but it's kind of
hard to maintain over time and

86
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,570
it's kind of a conflict.

87
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,120
So to get a tool to do that
for you, you turn on

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,940
mod_pagespeed and the four lines
of links become one link

89
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,490
with a concatenated name.

90
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,610
And one of the most important
things we do is we add to the

91
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,540
concatenated name a hashtag
which is the md5sum of the

92
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,580
content of the file.

93
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,710
And by doing this, that enables
us to serve this

94
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,320
resource, a combined
CSS file, with a

95
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,669
very long cache lifetime.

96
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:22,760
This means that browsers
will retain

97
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,400
knowledge about this file &mdash;

98
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,660
we set the cache lifetime
for a year.

99
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,610
But if you want to go back and
change one of these CSS files

100
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:38,220
that it's built out of, then
mod_pagespeed will pick up

101
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,730
that change, will recompute the
md5 tag, will serve the

102
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,890
rewritten CSS link with a new
name, and the old stale entry

103
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,110
in the browser cache
doesn't hurt you.

104
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,330
So you kind of get the best of
both worlds, which is a long

105
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,720
cache lifetime but an easily
changeable site.

106
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,405
So how do you bring
mod_pagespeed into your web

107
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:02,700
server flow?

108
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,560
You have an existing
Apache HTTP server.

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,860
You can download from
co.google.com.

110
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,020
Our source code and pilot
where we have pre-built

111
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,960
binaries for CentOS and
DBN and Ubuntu.

112
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,550
And so you pretty much download
into the Apache

113
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,280
server, and now you don't have
to change your content, you

114
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,140
don't have to change your
content generation flow.

115
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,070
You may want to tweak some of
the settings in pagespeed.com,

116
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,600
that's optional.

117
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,780
And you get out of that reduced
latency, improved

118
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,780
bandwidth, and much longer
cache lifetimes.

119
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,360

120
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,780
So taking a peek under the hood,
mod_pagespeed is really

121
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,030
divided into two sections.

122
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,600

123
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,780
There's a platform-independent
rewriting infrastructure, and

124
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,600
it has a whole bunch of pieces
in it, but it's all called

125
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,495
Pagespeed Automatic.

126
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,090
And this is the engine that
rewrites webpages on the fly.

127
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,460
On the right we have a bunch of
plug-ins, which are used to

128
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,700
adapt this architecture to
a specific platform.

129
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,120
And the first deployment
for this technology

130
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,310
is an Apache module.

131
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,730
So we have an Apache module
gasket, and this defines

132
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,850
mechanisms for caching HTTP
content, caching metadata,

133
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,650
fetching resources, threading,
and other assorted tasks. it's

134
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,970
kind of a plug-in architecture
so that this can be applied to

135
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,060
multiple platforms,
but our deployment

136
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,830
initially is Apache HTTP.

137
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,790

138
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,110
How much factor has
this made the web?

139
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,340
So so far, this has been
launched for about six months.

140
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,530
We launched in November
of last year.

141
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,030
A few days after that,
DreamHost, a hosting provider,

142
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,730
made it a push button on
their control panel.

143
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,910
So any DreamHost-hosted site
can push a button and

144
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,520
mod_pagespeed is activated
on their site.

145
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,190
A couple of months later, we
announced with Go Daddy, the

146
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,420
dominant hosting provider &mdash;

147
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,300
who has a similar push-button
flow, it's actually a config

148
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,800
file change &mdash; but any Go Daddy
user can enable mod_pagespeed

149
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,720
with, basically, a line
in a config file.

150
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,750

151
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,870
The project is built on a large
base of source code,

152
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,570
including the pagespeed source
code and a lot of Chromium

153
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,155
source code, but we have about
60,000 lines of code that we

154
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:34,220
wrote ourselves for this.

155
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,540
It's a significant project.

156
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,150
About 54,000 sites have
installed and are running

157
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,020
mod-pagespeed as of today, and
the number is climbing.

158
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,480
So what does mod_pagespeed
do to the sites?

159
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,880
Well, let's take a look at 28
sites that we looked at that

160
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,620
have installed mod_pagespeed.

161
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,420
To test the site, we used a tool
called webpagetest.org.

162
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,410
webpagetest.org is a
client-side testing

163
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:03,970
technology.

164
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,360
It's built in with
various browsers.

165
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,415
In our case, the browser
that we used was IE8.

166
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:13,450
So these are all IE8-based
numbers.

167
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,060
And the blue lines indicate
the first time the page is

168
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,880
brought up.

169
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,760
And the red lines indicate the
repeat view, so that's with a

170
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,090
warm cache.

171
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,560
And every website
is different.

172
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,260
We find that a typical
improvement between 20% and

173
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,169
30% is not surprising.

174
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,010
We've seen improvements
as much as 50%.

175
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,440
And this is basically just by
downloading a module and

176
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
turning it on.

177
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,200
There are websites that have
already been hand tuned to

178
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,940
follow all the best practices,
basically do the same things

179
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,240
manually that mod_pagespeed
does automatically.

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,520
And in that case, we don't
offer much improvement.

181
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,640
In fact, we add some overhead
because we have to go and

182
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,430
parse the website and say,
nope, this is all done.

183
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,350
So let's look at this data from
a different perspective.

184
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,190
Let's look at the images on the
top 1,000 websites on the

185
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,590
web, the Alexa 1,000.

186
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,620
On this corpus of images, a
fairly significant number of

187
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,670
them, mod_pagespeed just looked
at them and said, I can

188
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,020
get rid of a huge percentage
of the bytes.

189
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,790
Over 75% of the bytes.

190
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,020
This would typically happen if
somebody takes a photograph

191
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,990
from a camera and puts it into
a thumbnail on a webpage.

192
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,520
Most of those pixels are not
going to be seen by the user,

193
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,890
so why do you want to
ship them over the

194
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,040
wire all the time?

195
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,470
You get a machine to reduce
that for you.

196
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,650
You don't have to manage that
with compressing it with

197
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,280
ImageMagick yourself, you just
let mod_pagespeed do it.

198
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,410
But a really surprisingly high
number of images can be

199
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,960
improved by a significant
amount, say 20% to 25%.

200
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,700
And these typically come from
just better compression

201
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,310
ratios, or re-encoding color
maps to be more optimal, or

202
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,060
getting rid of all of the
metadata, the f-stop at which

203
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,680
the photograph was
taken, et cetera.

204
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,510

205
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,370
So let's dive into one of the
sites that has installed

206
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,270
mod_pagespeed, called
androidacademy.com.

207
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,150
First of all, we know that
this has installed

208
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,420
mod_pagespeed because when we
look at the HTTP response

209
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,040
headers from that site,
one of them &mdash;

210
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,720
the one where the gray
arrow is pointing &mdash;

211
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,610
it says x-mod-pagespeed.

212
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,000
So we know that that site was
rewritten by mod_pagespeed.

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,190
So we tested this site
webpagetest.org, which

214
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,230
produces a lot of data.

215
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,480
It also produces videos.

216
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:46,930

217
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,970
So on the left, mod_pagespeed
is off, on the right,

218
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,860
mod_pagespeed is on.

219
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,660
So this a downloaded and go.

220
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,390
In this case, the site is sped
up noticeably by turning

221
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,500
mod_pagespeed on.

222
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,840
But let's go back and
look at the numbers.

223
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,520

224
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,000
So here's some colored bars.

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,490
The top colored bars represent
the first view.

226
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,950
The off on the top
and on the below.

227
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,200
And below that, you see
the repeat views.

228
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,040
The first bar, the blue
bar, represents the

229
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,190
time to first byte.

230
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,010
That's the time between when the
browser sent the request

231
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,900
for the HTML file and
the first byte of

232
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,700
HTML that came back.

233
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,030
And you'll notice that when we
turn mod_pagespeed on, we

234
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,530
actually make that take
a little bit longer.

235
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,840
And that's because we've
introduced this server, this

236
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,510
rewriting pipeline
into the flow.

237
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,280
So we've actually added
some processing.

238
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,350
Typically 10 to 30 milliseconds
of delay is added

239
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,350
to that first byte.

240
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,380
But we find so much on most
websites to improve that by

241
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,240
the time you get to the time
to first paint, we've

242
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,780
benefited the site by
close to a second.

243
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,450
By the time you get to the page
load time, the onload

244
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,870
handler, we've benefited the
site by more than two seconds

245
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,070
on the first view.

246
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,930
And on repeat views,
the numbers are

247
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,740
a little bit different.

248
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,730
And the reasons for the
improvement are also

249
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,990
different, and we'll
go into those.

250
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,680

251
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,250
So these are the waterfall
diagrams for this site,

252
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,990
androidacademy.com, that have
been collected and rendered by

253
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,150
webpagetest.org.

254
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,700
On the left mod_pagespeed
is off, on the right

255
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,490
mod_pagespeed is on.

256
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,260
The top ones are first
view and the bottom

257
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,130
ones are repeat view.

258
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,400
And each of the things, you
don't have to zoom very far

259
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,550
into these things and look
at all the data to

260
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,860
understand the story.

261
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,550
On the first view, you'll notice
that the waterfall

262
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,410
diagram is significantly
shorter.

263
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,850
It's probably about 30% shorter
with mod_pagespeed on.

264
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,980
And that's because
of two things.

265
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,040
It's because of inlining
small resources so

266
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,770
there's less HTTP requests.

267
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,930
And it's because of combining
resources, combining multiple

268
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,760
CSS files into one, et cetera.

269
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,800
On the bottom, we have
the repeat view.

270
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,660
I should say the first view
also benefits because we

271
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,540
compress images.

272
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,300
So we make the images smaller,
but it's harder to tell that

273
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,230
by looking at a zoomed out
view of the webpage.

274
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,430
You'd have to look at the
waterfall diagram in a lot

275
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,680
more detail to see that.

276
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,200
But we'll take a look in more
detail at an example where we

277
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,690
can show that later.

278
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,370
So the bottom charts with the
big yellow blobs, those are

279
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,350
the repeat view.

280
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,720
And what those yellow bars mean
is that's called a 304.

281
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,070
That's where the browser has
a copy of the resource &mdash;

282
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,780
an image or a CSS file &mdash;

283
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,130
but it doesn't know because it
doesn't have a long caching

284
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,950
lifetime or the cache
is expired.

285
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,050
Is this valid or not?

286
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,300
So it has to send a request to
the server saying, hey I've

287
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,050
got this resource.

288
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,190
It's got this hex tag
called an Etag.

289
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,610
Is this one good?

290
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,010
And in this case, during these
tests, it is good.

291
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,020
So the server sends back,
yes, yes, go with that.

292
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,680
And that's a very low bandwidth
request, but it

293
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,450
incurs a complete
roundtrip time.

294
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,920
So with mod_pagespeed off, you
have to do a lot of round

295
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,190
trips to the server, even with
a warm cache, just to make

296
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,560
sure that all these resources
are still valid.

297
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,360
Because we've done cache
extension and added those

298
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,010
hashtags, those md5sums
to every URL.

299
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,020
The browser, if it has the
URL, it's the correct URL

300
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,200
because the content hash
is in the URL.

301
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,660
So that's why the repeat view
waterfall diagram with

302
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,750
mod_pagespeed on looks a
lot more compelling.

303
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,720

304
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,930
So let's take a look at how
we do our measurement.

305
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,430

306
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:56,050
With webpagetest.org, we
did four runs, which is

307
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,470
mod_pagespeed on and off with
repeat view and first view.

308
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,320
And then we repeat
that 50 times.

309
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,890
And the reason that we repeat
that 50 times is that

310
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,260
measurement on the
web is hard.

311
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:12,230
If you were to get a stopwatch
and hit the refresh button in

312
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,430
your browser a whole bunch of
times and just write down all

313
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,430
the numbers, you'd see
that there's a

314
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,310
fair amount of variance.

315
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,350
It's kind of hard to do this.

316
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,940
It's a lot easier for machine to
do this, but still there's

317
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,210
a lot of things in between the
client and the server that can

318
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,200
cause variance.

319
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,870
It's a measurement variance.

320
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,240
One of those things
is the network.

321
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,470
In this case, Android Academy is
hosted in England, and our

322
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,230
testing clients were
located in the US.

323
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,550
So we had an intercontinental
delay, which probably added a

324
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,510
fair amount of variance to our
test. And I think that's

325
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,010
probably what accounts for
most of the jitter.

326
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:52,580
But we have also seen with many
other sites where the

327
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,830
servers are overloaded.

328
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,440

329
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,760
And you'll see the red
and blue dots are

330
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,510
much more of a jumble.

331
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,120
And it's hard, if you were to
just one repeat or three

332
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,420
repeats or something like that,
you could easily draw

333
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,830
the wrong conclusion.

334
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,990
And you have to see a lot
of data for us to

335
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,860
be able to get confident.

336
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,530
So in this case, while there's
a fair amount of jitter, the

337
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,310
improvement is pretty clear.

338
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,520
There's jitter in the
measurement, but the results

339
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,730
are quite clear that
mod_pagespeed has consistently

340
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,980
benefited this site.

341
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,230

342
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,390
So where are we going
with mod_pagespeed

343
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,120
speed down the road?

344
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,190

345
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,270
We are installed on around
60,000 servers.

346
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,390
That's a start, but we'd like to
make the whole web faster,

347
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,140
and not just 60,000 sites.

348
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,190
So we're seeking leveraged ways
to do that &mdash; high volume

349
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,760
partners, hosting
providers, CDNs.

350
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,130
We'd like to encourage leverage
integrations with

351
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,010
servers, proxies, and caches
that could put

352
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,260
this technology inline.

353
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,980
And we saw in the architecture
slide earlier, it's kind of a

354
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,860
plug-in architecture.

355
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,990
So it should be feasible to
integrate this rewriting

356
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:11,140
technology into other stacks
other than the Apache stack.

357
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,619
And we've just been going all
out trying to support every

358
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,920
user that uses mod_pagespeed.

359
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,730
You can see us on Twitter, you
can see us on our discussions

360
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,410
list, et cetera, trying to get
everybody successful that's

361
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,540
trying to use it.

362
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,640
We'd also like to make the web
more fast. We've been going to

363
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,220
the basic optimizations that are
recommended in the Souders

364
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,020
books that I showed before.

365
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,270
But we're working on things like
image spreading and WebP

366
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,760
integration.

367
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,510
We're going to talk about
WebP in the next

368
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,760
segment of the talk.

369
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,610

370
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,990
We'd like to add deferring
JavaScript execution.

371
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,380
There's a whole suite of things
that we are anxious and

372
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,030
excited to start working on
to make this speed-up more

373
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,030
dramatic than what
we have so far.

374
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,970
It's also important to put
effort into measurement.

375
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,900
We want to measure better.

376
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,340
We have dozens of filters now
that help rewrite web pages.

377
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,270
Which of these have
the most impact?

378
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,630
We'd like to get some
data behind that.

379
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,180
And we'd like to help users
evaluate the benefits for

380
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,010
mod_pagespeed.

381
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,390
The more you're hitting refresh
with a stopwatch, the

382
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,200
more hard it's going
to be to draw

383
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,500
repeatable conclusions from &mdash;

384
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,890
we want to enable users to
effectively gauge the benefit

385
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,140
they're getting from
mod_pagespeed.

386
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,050

387
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:34,420
I want to jump out of the
presentation and show you more

388
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,280
image stuff.

389
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,830
So this is an example
you can do yourself.

390
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,300
This is off of modpagespeed.com.

391
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,770
This is the site I showed
a snapshot of earlier.

392
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,390
This shows you all of the
rewrite passes at

393
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,660
mod_pagespeed supports.

394
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,670
I went into the rewrite
images example.

395
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,940
This is the before picture,
where we have three images.

396
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,520

397
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,450
And this is the source code &mdash;

398
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,500
view source, it's probably
not that visible.

399
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,810

400
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,320
So there's a couple of
key points here.

401
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,830
Puzzle.jpg is about
235 kilobytes.

402
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,640
We don't really need
all those bits.

403
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,840
We've displayed it
in a small space.

404
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,660
Why not have the rewritten
puzzle.jpg, which is put into

405
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,090
a 256 by 192 thumbnail.

406
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,750
Which we can serve you in 21
kilobytes, and can you tell

407
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,000
the difference?

408
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,970

409
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,530
In addition to that, besides
making that JPEG a lot smaller

410
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,310
than when you pulled it out of
the camera, one of these

411
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,060
images is sufficiently small.

412
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,520
I think it's this coffee cup.

413
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,190
It's sufficiently small that
we've decided that it's better

414
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,790
to inline it.

415
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:03,090
So on the on the after page with
mod_pagespeed on, you see

416
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,965
one less line in the
waterfall diagram.

417
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:08,510

418
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,750
And that's because that coffee
cup has been rendered as a

419
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,100
data URL so that it can be
displayed without having any

420
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,210
additional HTTP requests.

421
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:29,560

422
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,736
So mod_pagespeed.

423
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:34,190
It's an open source
Apache module.

424
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,930
It uses an Apache license, which
means you can basically

425
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,200
download the code and do
whatever you like with it.

426
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,140
So it's an open source Apache
module, which automatically

427
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,770
makes your websites faster.

428
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,055
There's two key points here.

429
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:47,920
One is that it makes your
websites faster by doing these

430
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,180
rewrites for fairly well-known
techniques.

431
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,850
And the other one is that
it's automatic.

432
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,210
Even if you know these
techniques, you might decide

433
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,190
that you don't want to keep
doing them yourself manually

434
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,410
every time you change
your site.

435
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,360
So there's all kinds
of material on

436
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,490
the web about this.

437
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,660
It's easy to search
for it now.

438
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,300
The first place to go is
modpagespeed.com, which shows

439
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,600
all of the places &mdash;

440
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,950
all of the rewrites that
we do before and after.

441
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,810

442
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,340
So next up, we have
Richard Rabbat who

443
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,780
will talk about WebP.

444
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,030
RICHARD RABBAT: Thank you.

445
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:31,350

446
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,370
So before I start talking about
WebP, I want to mention

447
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,940
that when Josh and I started
this project, people were

448
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,020
telling us that we were crazy.

449
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,790
We had this developer tool,
pagespeed, that we've been

450
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:48,620
innovating with, adding lots
of new best practices, and

451
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,850
trying to understand
how people can

452
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,100
make their pages faster.

453
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,550
And then at some point, we
decided this we should make

454
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,470
this automatic.

455
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,140
We decided that we could try to
spend a lot of engineering

456
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,250
time to make the web developer
not spend time themselves

457
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,210
optimizing their pages, but
instead focusing on their

458
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,320
content and adding delightful
content for your users.

459
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,280

460
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,110
At Google it's kind of
nice, because they

461
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,230
let you try and fail.

462
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,020
If you fail too many
times, they

463
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,070
don't let you try anymore.

464
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,270
But it was just amazing.

465
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,710
When we launched this,
the uptake was &mdash;

466
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,520
we were actually not expecting
that people really wanted this

467
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,580
technology in that fashion.

468
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,540
We were very surprised.

469
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,320
It just helped the engineering
team put in more effort.

470
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,630
People put in weekends,
weeknights,

471
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,330
and things like that.

472
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,600
One thing that Josh mentioned,
which is we've been doing a

473
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,570
lot of measurements with things
like webpagetest.org.

474
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,370
And it's a great tool because
you can see what's happening.

475
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,350
But last week &mdash;

476
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,700
if you have Google Analytics
on your website, the Google

477
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,820
Analytics team launched a site
speed measurement tool, which

478
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,770
allows you to see the exact
latency that your users

479
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,970
actually experience.

480
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,990
As opposed to when you're under
a controlled environment

481
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,750
from a certain server or
close your server.

482
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,410
So if you use Google Analytics,
you should

483
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,540
definitely add one line of code
and see what your users

484
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,850
are experiencing in
terms of latency.

485
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,760
It may be very eye-opening
for you.

486
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,280

487
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,870
So talking about WebP.

488
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,990
WebP is one of these other
examples of crazy ideas that

489
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,555
we try and we see if
it's going to work.

490
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:55,520

491
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,480
And as you all know, most of
the images out there are in

492
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,390
JPEG format.

493
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,720
This is one of the Google
logos at some point.

494
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,256
So a JPEG is a lossy format.

495
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:11,780

496
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,280
GIF has been there for
a very long time.

497
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,420
It has very specific use cases
that people still want to

498
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,020
have. There's the tracking
pixels, which we don't like

499
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,560
talk about.

500
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,620
But there's also things like
transparency and animation.

501
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,150
Gif is great at allowing
you to do transparency.

502
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:38,102
But also people like small
animations, two or three

503
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,590
images next to each other.

504
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,990
PNG has been used &mdash;

505
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,750
portable network graphics &mdash; has
been used for very high

506
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,280
quality icons, texts, graphs,
things like this.

507
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,430
There's an example
a PNG Google I/O.

508
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,790
You want to see a developer
conference, you want to be

509
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:59,440
able to read the words
"developer conference."

510
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,850
But if you look at webpages &mdash;

511
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,020
we all know that an image
is worth a 1,000 words &mdash;

512
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:13,170
and today on the web there's a
lot of bytes that are totally

513
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,110
image bytes.

514
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,330
And you can look at &mdash;

515
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,780
this is data from
httparchive.org.

516
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,800
And the HTML bytes that you're
shipping to users are in the

517
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:31,100
10s of kilobytes, and images
are in the 400 kilobytes.

518
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:37,560
There's this data from Intel
Corporation that says that

519
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,930
compression hasn't changed over
the past few years, but

520
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,830
there's a lot of CPU
power that people

521
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,620
have on their devices.

522
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,530
Some of you may have gotten
some tab devices today.

523
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,630
Great technology.

524
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:01,760
The processing technology in
these tablets are way more

525
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,120
advanced than what
you got in a new

526
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,070
supercomputer 10 years ago.

527
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,730
And there's a lot of algorithmic
improvements.

528
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,700

529
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,710
So we decided to try to figure
out if we can propose an image

530
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,395
format that can lead to
better compression

531
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:21,700
than what JPEG does.

532
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,930
It is based on the VP8
bitstream, which is what's

533
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,410
also used for the web
and video format.

534
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:33,220
And at first, we did a pretty
large study with

535
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,310
about 900,000 JPEGs.

536
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:40,020
And if we took them and we tried
to compress them again

537
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,250
for the same signal-to-noise
ratio, we would get about

538
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,000
39.8% better compression.

539
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,580
And we thought, oh maybe it's
just because the JPEGs that

540
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,400
are out there are just
full of extra bytes

541
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,820
that are not be needed.

542
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,470
And basically we did something
we called re-JPEG &mdash;

543
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,380
JPEG recompression.

544
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,520
And we could only get 14%
improvement over that.

545
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,720
Recently, we started a new study
which is based on SSIM,

546
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,620
which is considered a better
metric for image quality.

547
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:22,090
And we took about 26,000 PNGs
and we did a compression at

548
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,580
JPEG quality of 75, we
recompressed for the

549
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,710
equivalent SSIM quality.

550
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,880
We were getting about
40% smaller.

551
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,330
Towards the end of this week or
next week, we're going to

552
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,440
release a much larger study with
some of the images that

553
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,420
people are used to looking at
when they look at image

554
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,820
compression.

555
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,760
Now why is WebP so cool?

556
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,160
If you look at low bitrate
performance &mdash;

557
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,880
this is an image that one of
our friends from Wikipedia,

558
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,760
Mathias Schindler tried.

559
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,760
He took a picture of one of
these German senators and

560
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,410
tried to compress at a very low
bitrate in WebP and JPEG.

561
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,680
You can see at low bitrate,
JPEG just

562
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,030
doesn't quite get it.

563
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:15,870
And at high bitrate, WebP
provides something that's just

564
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,900
as good as a lossless
compression like PNG.

565
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,810

566
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,710
And why do we do WebP?

567
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,860
This is data from, again,
webpagetest.org.

568
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,120
We have this website where we're
comparing a bunch of

569
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,220
images that we put in JPEG
versus a bunch of images that

570
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,720
we put in WebP.

571
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,310
And you can see that some of
the data &mdash; for example, the

572
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,470
fully loaded data &mdash;

573
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:50,370
shows that for WebP, you can
save about three seconds in

574
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,430
time for fully loaded,
because you're

575
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,320
downloading many less parts.

576
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,870
In this case, we're downloading
529 kilobytes,

577
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,830
versus 729 kilobytes.

578
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,580
And it directly impacts the
speed of your webpage loading.

579
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,870

580
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,870
So we started with WebP and we
focused on speed, because that

581
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:17,850
was going to be the major
feature of the format.

582
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,360
But we also wanted to delight
a lot of our users.

583
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,420
So when we first released it,
people gave us some good

584
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,260
feedback that they wanted
to see a better

585
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,910
encoding of the image.

586
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:36,220
And we spent a few months, we
improved the encoder itself to

587
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,030
focus specifically
on still images.

588
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:44,900
The WebM encoder was very
focused on the transitions,

589
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,680
the video stuff.

590
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,865
Instead, with WebP we
focus our encoding

591
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:52,490
on the still image.

592
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,290
And the feedback is
it's now beating

593
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,740
JPEG much more readily.

594
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,040
So what are we doing next?

595
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,580
A bunch of new features.

596
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:08,810
We want to support people's need
for metadata, and we're

597
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,370
adding XMP support.

598
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,000
XMP is extensible metadata
platform.

599
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,330
We know some people are used to
XF, but XF has been painful

600
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,970
for lots of people as well,
because there's no

601
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,160
standard around it.

602
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,380
It just creates problems
for the web.

603
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,670
So because this is a format that
we want to have for many

604
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:39,320
years in the future, we're
focusing on better, cleaner

605
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,470
technology.

606
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,260
Animation.

607
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,580
When we first launched WebP,
we had a lot of comments.

608
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,630
We want animation.

609
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,250
We said, well just use
the video tag.

610
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,490
It's great.

611
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,200
And they're like, no.

612
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,880
So we tried to figure out
exactly why, and it turns out

613
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,510
it's mostly a philosophical
issue as opposed to a

614
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,790
technology issue.

615
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,000
People that like to do
development of animated images

616
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,980
really want to use the typical
software that they're used to,

617
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,480
like their Photoshop,
their ImageMagick.

618
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,610
They don't want to use FFmpeg
for creating animation.

619
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,130
So we're adding this.

620
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:27,410
And because we're now in a much
newer world, we're adding

621
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,050
3D stereoscopy.

622
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,480
Tiling, because you can have
a bunch of images, you can

623
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,850
create as large of an
image as you'd like.

624
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:42,300
And you can start displaying
parts of the image as you can

625
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,140
download it.

626
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:51,200
And there's one cool thing
that we're adding.

627
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,870
Who knows about CSS
background images?

628
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,520
OK.

629
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,640
Who likes how they have
to write them?

630
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,470
OK, thank you.

631
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:05,640
So if you look at the
third column &mdash;

632
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,590
sorry for the colors
a little bit here.

633
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,930
So we're basically grouping
images together and they're

634
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,650
going to have a hashtag.

635
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:20,550
And image source, for example,
group.webp#john and #jack.

636
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,520
And then instead of having to
figure out exactly at what

637
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,270
coordinates you're going to pick
the image from, you can

638
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,640
actually just refer to
the image within

639
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,530
that multi-image format.

640
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,306
And there won't be any
weird CSS to write.

641
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:41,520

642
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,740
For 3D &mdash; again, if you look
at the third column &mdash;

643
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,950
if you look at 3D images that
are out there that are in

644
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,110
JPEG, if you display them on a
2D display, they just don't

645
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,030
make any sense.

646
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,400
So with our ability to put
multiple images in the same

647
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,020
image file, we can actually call
the left image versus the

648
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,280
right image separately, and
then we can show them.

649
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,540
It depends on what display
technology one is using, and

650
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:17,540
then you can see you can maybe
downgrade to a 2D for some

651
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,290
people, present 3D for others.

652
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,080
And also use &mdash;

653
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,180
it depends on the capabilities
of the device.

654
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,950
But it's definitely an image
format that we're looking at

655
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,630
to grow in the future, so it's
still young and we're adding

656
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,030
some more things.

657
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,750
Last week, one of the engineers
added a JNI

658
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,740
interface, which we
think is cool.

659
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,560
And we're adding lossless so
that we can have better

660
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,530
transparency support.

661
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:54,460
On the product side, Picasa web
albums, Gmail, and Google

662
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,700
App Engine are adding support.

663
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,470
Picasa web albums already has
it, as well as Gmail.

664
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,630
Google App Engine is going to
have that support soon.

665
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:11,520
And what you get with WebP is
when you have VP8 hardware

666
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,906
support, you get the WebP
hardware support immediately.

667
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:17,639

668
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,770
The next release will also
have a much faster codec.

669
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,760
Now that's we have a very good
encoder, we're spending some

670
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,969
time writing assembly code
to make it much faster.

671
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,219
That's it.

672
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:34,139

673
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:38,860
And at this point, I'd like to
welcome Hakon to talk about

674
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,050
Opera and WebP.

675
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,300
Thank you.

676
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:48,635

677
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:50,360
HAKON WIUM LIE: Perfect,
thank you.

678
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,620
Thank you Richard, thanks
for inviting me here.

679
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:57,420
I was at Google I/O last year as
well, when the video format

680
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,900
WebM was introduced.

681
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
And this is a pleasant follow-up
I think, to be able

682
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,940
to do a still image format.

683
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,800
I have to make one comment
though, you talk about the

684
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,870
weird CSS syntax.

685
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:12,220
I'm partially to blame for that,
I proposed CSS in 1994,

686
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,650
and my baby has kind of
grown since then.

687
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,680
And I agree with you, that
the background &mdash;

688
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,960
the multiple background images
is kind of weird.

689
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,980
But it's also stuff that
we don't really

690
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,290
encourage people to use.

691
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,040
You shouldn't really have
multiple background images on

692
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,630
your elements.

693
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,720
That's only if you want to do
rounded corners or something.

694
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,190
And we actually have to better
properties for that now.

695
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,650
Border radius is there.

696
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:38,910
So you don't really have to do
the weird CSS thing anyway.

697
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,450
Also, a word of warning.

698
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,910
In this session you will be
hearing a lot about automated

699
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,960
techniques for improving
performance.

700
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,310
And I think that's helpful.

701
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,280
That's why we're doing it.

702
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,790
We're doing it too at Opera.

703
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,920
But there's limits to how far
you can go with that.

704
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,450
You still have to take
responsibility for your HTML

705
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,120
code, for your CSS code,
and for your images.

706
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,870
We can only get so far with
automated techniques.

707
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:06,430
So we still need bright minds
out there to do the coding.

708
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,970
Given that we do want automated
techniques though,

709
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,670
I'd like to present Opera's
views on those.

710
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,220
And we start sort of
on the other end.

711
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,760
We start not on the server
end, we start with the

712
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,710
clients, with the users.

713
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,590
And probably the product
that many of you know &mdash;

714
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,140
we have about 100 million people
using Opera Mini these

715
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,250
days, active users.

716
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:34,520
Opera Mini is a small client
originally written in Java

717
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,560
that runs in handsets, typically
in mobile phones,

718
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,680
many of them in the
developing world.

719
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,440
And they give internet access,
web access, to ordinary

720
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,730
phones, to ordinary people.

721
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,760
People who don't have
PCs, perhaps.

722
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,040
People who don't have even
the power to run a PC.

723
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,660
And what we do there is that
in the fixed network &mdash;

724
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,420
in the proxy service &mdash; we fetch
the pages and basically

725
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,250
just get the URL from
the mobile phone.

726
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,655
We fetch the page, we compress
it to a binary format, that we

727
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:11,700
send, then, over the wireless
network to the handset.

728
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:18,540
And currently we process
about 60 billion pages

729
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,790
per month on this.

730
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,470
We have many people in many
places far away from here,

731
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,720
like Russia, Indonesia,
India, places where

732
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,360
the bandwidth costs &mdash;

733
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,170
you pay per kilobyte, perhaps.

734
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,200
Or there's limited
connectivity.

735
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,400
Of course, there's never
limited connectivity

736
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,650
like here is there?

737
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,600

738
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:48,150
The other thing we do in this
space is Opera Turbo.

739
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,230
Opera Turbo is sort
of similar.

740
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:54,380
It's also a proxy service that
compresses, but unlike Opera

741
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,020
Mini, which compresses into a
binary format, Opera Turbo

742
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,900
just compresses by compressing
the HTML, the CSS, and the

743
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,800
images, much like you talked
about earlier here.

744
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,120
Opera Turbo is available from
the normal Opera desktop

745
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,990
application.

746
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,520
So if you download Opera
from opera.com,

747
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,710
you can turn on Turbo.

748
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,560
If it detects that you're on a
slow network, it will suggest,

749
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,760
perhaps you should turn me on.

750
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,910
And currently we have about five
billion page views per

751
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,470
month for Opera Turbo.

752
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,740
So it's significantly smaller
than Opera Mini, which has 60,

753
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,300
but still a lot of people
are using this.

754
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,280
And about a month ago,
we introduced

755
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,570
WebP into Opera Turbo.

756
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:44,940
We found out, after doing some
research, that WebP was the

757
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:50,470
perfect fit to encode the
images for Opera Turbo.

758
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,350
Here's a typical page.

759
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,750
You save about 50%
of the bandwidth.

760
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,080
It'd be interesting to see how
much Opera Turbo can compress

761
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,350
on top of the page speed module
that we saw there.

762
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,560
Whether those two will actually
really double the

763
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
performance or whether
they equal.

764
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,210
We should look into that.

765
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,580
But these are typical numbers
that we see, that you reduce

766
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,330
the size by 50% percent
and of course, then

767
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,180
time also goes down.

768
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,520
So images is an important
part of this.

769
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,320
And WebP we found out
was a perfect match.

770
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,600
If we take just a sample image
found on Flickr, when we do

771
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,830
the really hard compression
here, when we tried to go

772
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,100
really, really low,
we see that JPEG

773
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,060
has significant artifact.

774
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,260
It may be hard to see in this
projected mode here, but you

775
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,160
can see in the middle where JPEG
is used, we go down from

776
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,280
155 k to 8k.

777
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,310
We see significant artifact
around the head of the turtle,

778
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,020
for example.

779
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,040
Whereas in WebP, which
is even lower &mdash;

780
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,980
it's down to only 5kb &mdash;

781
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,030
we don't see those artifacts.

782
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,430
Now, this may be he's slightly
unfair to JPEG because the

783
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,280
original comes across
as a JPEG from the

784
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,950
first place, right?

785
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,250
So when you do another JPEG, it
seems like you get really

786
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,630
weird block effects when
these things double up.

787
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,350
And that may be one reason why
WebP is performing so well.

788
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,780
But so be it.

789
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,540
It works well, gives us
better compression.

790
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,030
And here's another one.

791
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:32,620
Again, we see that we have
strong artifact in the middle

792
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,380
image, whereas WebP gives
us better looking pages.

793
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,090

794
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:44,130
Now here's the colleague
of mine, Charles.

795
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,900
He's chief standards
officer at Opera.

796
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,380
And also I think the WebP
looks the best here.

797
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,210
If you look at the one
to the right, you see

798
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,410
his wrinkles there?

799
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:58,410
They they kind of disappeared.

800
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,900
So if you want to look beautiful
on screen, perhaps

801
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,840
WebP is the image
format to use.

802
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,433
Is this something you
put into decoder?

803
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:07,683
[LAUGHTER]

804
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:09,680

805
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,770
OK.

806
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,530
Very good.

807
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:19,170
Now, the uses of WebP that's
we've seen, both in the Apache

808
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,750
module and in Opera Turbo,
that's where things are being

809
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,350
applied automatically.

810
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,990
I think there's still a time
to go before you can start

811
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,850
actually putting WebP images
on the web in your pages.

812
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,320
Because if you do so, it's
going to be disruptive.

813
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,060
Because most browsers will
not be able to see

814
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,010
those images yet.

815
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,470
If you use Opera or if you use
Chrome, you can go to the

816
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,790
gallery and it shows up.

817
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,680
But most other browsers will
not be able to show that.

818
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,480
So there will be a time.

819
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,770
And we had the same thing happen
when we introduced PNG

820
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,240
some years ago.

821
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,320
It takes a while before
browsers catch up.

822
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,310
I hope the other browsers will
catch up and add support for

823
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,710
WebP, just like they should
all support WebM as well.

824
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,770
But until they do, you shouldn't
really exclude users

825
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,390
by relying on this
being available.

826
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,650

827
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,220
As a web community, we need to
make sure that our webpages

828
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,940
work in most browsers
and most devices.

829
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,980
And I think that's also an
encouragement to Google.

830
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,470
I have to admit, at Opera we
have some problem with some of

831
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:28,570
the more experimentive Google
services that come out.

832
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,950
You're not always good at
testing in all cases.

833
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,620
So I encourage testing
to every one of us.

834
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,320
We need to make this web thing
work, we can't make it work

835
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,300
for half the people,
half the browsers.

836
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,110
We need to make it work
for everything.

837
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,310
That's one of the strengths
of the web, and I

838
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,890
hope that will continue.

839
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,793
Thank you.

840
00:42:46,793 --> 00:42:48,043
[APPLAUSE]

841
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:53,415

842
00:42:53,415 --> 00:42:56,390
RICHARD RABBAT: So we have time
for questions, if you

843
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,640
have any questions.

844
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,070

845
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,100
OK, go ahead.

846
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,350
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

847
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:13,110

848
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:16,750
Question for Joshua, actually.

849
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,180
Two things.

850
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:22,090
We're using Rackspace cloud,
and we pay on a

851
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,680
compute-cycle basis.

852
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,260
How would using mod_pagespeed
affect compute cycle usage?

853
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:33,960
And also, when you're doing
combined requests off of a

854
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,300
CDN, would that affect &mdash; when
you have multiple CDNs serving

855
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,650
the same content and you append
them for your CSS

856
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,880
requests, for instance &mdash;

857
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,840
would there be a performance
gain/loss?

858
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,980

859
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,590
JOSHUA MARANTZ: So the first
question is about the compute

860
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,910
costs associated with
mod_pagespeed.

861
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,810
And I should point that
mod_pagespeed uses a lot of

862
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,840
caching internally.

863
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,690
So although we are doing image
compression and image

864
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,060
resizing, et cetera, that's
really the only

865
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,480
compute-intensive thing
that we do.

866
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,610
But we cache the results, and
we only do that once.

867
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:16,050
So we think that amortized over
your entire site, it will

868
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:16,780
not be measurable.

869
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,490
But also please take into
account if you pay for

870
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,390
bandwidth or requests, you'll
be serving a lot less bytes

871
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,640
and a lot less requests
with mod_pagespeed.

872
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,400

873
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,010
Your second question is about
buying resources and CDNs.

874
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:38,460
And we support CDNs, we
support multi-server

875
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,870
configurations.

876
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:45,970
I'm not sure I entirely
understand your question.

877
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:49,260
Mod_pagespeed benefits CDNs
by making more resources

878
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,900
cacheable at the edge.

879
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,690
So it's, in general, a win.

880
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:58,060
And we enabled this because if
you remember, on the combined

881
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:03,920
CSS slide, the link name for the
combined CSS file encodes

882
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,520
all the information you need
to reproduce the result.

883
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,330
Which is why multi-server
is not a problem.

884
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,580
I hope that answers
your question.

885
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,670

886
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,190
Howdy.

887
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:21,190
So one of the big reasons that
PNG was so able to displace

888
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:25,810
GIF in many fields is that it
was not patent-encumbered.

889
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:31,640
And VP8 has, among other things,
not exactly been

890
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,410
forthcoming with complete
documentation for the format,

891
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,860
as is available for
JPEG and PNG.

892
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,830
And also the guarantee of not
being patent-encumbered is

893
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,390
still a little bit shaky, to
the point where VP8 simply

894
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,690
isn't available destroys
the valuable freedom

895
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,100
for Dora, for example.

896
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:54,570
So while I appreciate the
attempt to displace JPEG, now

897
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,440
that JPEG is actually
patent-free &mdash; the patents

898
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,260
expired four or five
years ago &mdash;

899
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,230
how is the WebP team planning on
addressing patent concerns.

900
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,890
RICHARD RABBAT: So I'm not a
lawyer, so I won't be talking

901
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,450
about a patent.

902
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,720
But you are welcome to
talk to our lawyers

903
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,180
about patent issues.

904
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:19,320
With respect to documentation,
I'll give you that we also

905
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,190
really lack on documentation.

906
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,620
We try our hardest,
but at some point

907
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:27,135
we don't have enough &mdash;

908
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:32,250
it would be great if you can
contribute documentation.

909
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,770
I don't understand VP8 because
there's no VP8 documentation

910
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,330
available for me to understand
it from.

911
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,370
RICHARD RABBAT: So we've been
doing a lot of work on

912
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,910
documentation, so we have
updated a lot of

913
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,050
documentation on VP8.

914
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,460
And I can certainly point to the
people that are working on

915
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,290
the VP8 documentation.

916
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,920
If there's any specific
feedback, we can definitely

917
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,440
make sure that we cover it.

918
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,980
Are there plans to submit a
formal specification in the

919
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:05,865
manner of PNG to relevant
working groups for review?

920
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:09,265
RICHARD RABBAT: So I'm not the
product manager for VP8, so I

921
00:47:09,265 --> 00:47:10,630
don't know exactly.

922
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:17,990
I know we have submitted an
informational RFC to document

923
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,710
what we do.

924
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:24,510
I don't know of the other
forward plans.

925
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,370
Fine, thank you.

926
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,170
So, does mod_pagespeed concept
change the way we should

927
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,120
approach design?

928
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,390
Should I have the designers now
producing all the pages

929
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:40,330
and putting the original art in
high quality large size and

930
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:45,600
breaking up the JavaScripts,
making no effort to do manual

931
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,056
optimization?

932
00:47:46,056 --> 00:47:48,310
Because then the machine
optimizers could do a much

933
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,421
better job at that?

934
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:51,990
RICHARD RABBAT: Please don't.

935
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,740
I'll start with that.

936
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,840
We've seen a lot of HTML
files that lie to us.

937
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,950
And for many reasons, we
can't optimize them.

938
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,670
When somebody tells us what MIME
type that file is, for

939
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:11,040
example, is it's actually the
wrong MIME type, that's one of

940
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,290
the examples.

941
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:16,450

942
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:21,360
The importance of mod_pagespeed
is that in many

943
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,610
cases, you don't have the cycles
to actually redo all

944
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,430
the designs.

945
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:30,540
For example, every time you
change your UI layout, you

946
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,760
want to go and make every
image change.

947
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,920
And you want to be careful about
the use of your front

948
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,840
end engineers for that.

949
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,445
And I'll let Josh
answer as well.

950
00:48:43,445 --> 00:48:45,760
JOSHUA MARANTZ: Sure.

951
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,790
I don't think that there's a
need to do a complete 180

952
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:54,810
degree turn in how you do your
design of your webpages.

953
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:58,200
But it offers you the
opportunity to gradually

954
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,200
consider maintainability and
efficiency of your design

955
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,620
process, and let machines take
care of the processes.

956
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:11,900
So you could get there, but as
always, I would recommend

957
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,280
taking it one step at a time.

958
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,010
This may be a silly question,
it made be enabled already,

959
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:21,670
but you're speaking of getting
mod_pagespeed enabled on

960
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,240
different hosts and different
servers and getting it built

961
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,020
into different stacks.

962
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,570
It seems to me that Google is
perfectly poised to do this,

963
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,600
considering it has its own stack
in Google App Engine.

964
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,480
Is mod_pagespeed available
for App Engine?

965
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,660
Is it going to be available
for App Engine?

966
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,120
Does it even apply
to App Engine?

967
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,450
RICHARD RABBAT: It is, I think,
the third bug that's

968
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:49,030
open on our issues list today.

969
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,830
For App Engine, it
is currently not

970
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,620
enabled in App Engine.

971
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,460
We've talked to the team,
they're very excited.

972
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,450
We're excited about potentially
providing it, but

973
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:08,120
we have not done any immediate
work on this.

974
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:12,370
We want to first focus on
stabilizing the technology,

975
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,130
making sure that we gets
the best out of it.

976
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:22,240
And benzes then deployments with
other servers as well.

977
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,910
One of the big questions, as
well, was how about EngineX?

978
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,630
How about Apache on Windows?

979
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,220
How about this?

980
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,590
Right now we're focused on the
core technology, and we'll

981
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,520
look at other things
in the future.

982
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,770
Thank you.

983
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,870
I think you actually just
answered my question.

984
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:44,070
We have seen a lot of success
with EngineX as a front end in

985
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,370
front of Apache, acting
as a reverse proxy.

986
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,070
It would be really great to
implement some of these

987
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:51,690
techniques on that
level instead.

988
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,810
So that's something that is on
the roadmap at some point?

989
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:00,070
JOSHUA MARANTZ: I stick EngineX
in front of Apache.

990
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:05,260

991
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:10,950
We've seen deployments where
EngineX is a front end and

992
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,560
Apache with mod_pagespeed
enabled is the back end, and

993
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,650
that should work great.

994
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:15,550
OK.

995
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,800
Yeah, thank you.

996
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,710

997
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:23,078
Can you talk to the
applicability of mod_pagespeed

998
00:51:23,078 --> 00:51:27,980
and WebP or similar tools to
smartphones and tablets today

999
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,230
or in the future?

1000
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,660

1001
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:36,050
RICHARD RABBAT: For
mod_pagespeed, every time you

1002
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:39,310
browse a page, you're going to
see a faster experience.

1003
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:44,270
One of the really cool things
about mod_pagespeed is that it

1004
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,300
reduces the number of
roundtrips you make.

1005
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,500
And the roundtrip on a mobile
device is a couple of seconds

1006
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,850
at some point.

1007
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:58,700
So it's a very helpful tool for
a wireless and 3G and 4G

1008
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,180
browsing experience.

1009
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:05,770
JOSHUA MARANTZ: Yeah, I'll add
that mobile best practice are

1010
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:09,470
different then desktop best
practices, in terms of

1011
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,600
delivering the best
web experience.

1012
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,900
And one of the things that we
get the opportunity to do in

1013
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,830
mod_pagespeed is deliver an
experience customized to the

1014
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:26,050
user agent, because we have a
stack that we pay a lot of

1015
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,270
attention to on a daily basis,
that gets to see the user

1016
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,750
agent and then decide
what to do.

1017
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,740
So for example, today we do
image inlining only on

1018
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,230
browsers that we know
to support it.

1019
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,420
And so, the image inlining is
automatic and it works.

1020
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,120
It doesn't leave
anybody behind.

1021
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,450
That's kind of also the vision
with WebP, is that we can

1022
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:48,250
transcode to WebP for browsers
that don't yet support it.

1023
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,820
But for browsers that do, you
would get WebP automatically

1024
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,210
for free without having to.

1025
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:57,160
So along those same lines,
being able to have a

1026
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,500
server-side decision about how
to render the webpage is only

1027
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,660
going to benefit mobile.

1028
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,420
Have we gotten everything that
we want out of mobile

1029
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,550
experience, out of mod_pagespeed
yet?

1030
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:06,926
No, we're still working
on that.

1031
00:53:06,926 --> 00:53:13,250

1032
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,410
I work in organization I think
that has a fairly typical

1033
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,570
workflow, in that we have a
centrally hosted content

1034
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:25,990
management system which writes
out static assets to a CDN.

1035
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:30,705
So we don't have control over
the buildout of the technology

1036
00:53:30,705 --> 00:53:33,340
at the CDN, but we
would like to &mdash;

1037
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:39,200
for static assets such as CSS
and JS files, we run a manual

1038
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,630
compression script before
pushing out.

1039
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:47,850
For images however, we don't
have anything in place,

1040
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:48,170
essentially.

1041
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,950
Are there standalone
components?

1042
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,770
Are there ways of ripping out
the image compression

1043
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:57,515
components of this and running
that against our asses before

1044
00:53:57,515 --> 00:54:00,270
we push to CDN?

1045
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,150
JOSHUA MARANTZ: So I guess the
point of mod_pagespeed is not

1046
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:09,050
that we have new or unique image
processing capabilities.

1047
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:12,060
Under the hood, actually
it's OpenCV.

1048
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:15,580
ImageMagick is another good
engine that a lot of people

1049
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,790
use when they're doing
this kind of

1050
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:18,440
manual compression step.

1051
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,110
The point of mod_pagespeed is
to save you the effort of

1052
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,570
having to manage that
flow yourself.

1053
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:26,170
But given that you have that
flow and you want to keep

1054
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:29,400
doing it, something like
ImageMagick or other tools

1055
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,400
like that are probably the best
bet for doing standalone

1056
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,585
image compression.

1057
00:54:33,585 --> 00:54:36,280
RICHARD RABBAT: I think he was
talking about further out

1058
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,540
where you have the HTML content
and you want to figure

1059
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:43,640
out how the image should
be optimized

1060
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,800
for that HTML content.

1061
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:51,030
Yeah, there's a number
of touch points.

1062
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:57,120
There's always, especially in
fairly large sites, you can

1063
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,150
optimize at the CDN, you
can optimize before

1064
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,550
you push to the CDN.

1065
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,230
You could do some smart
edge-level page caching.

1066
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,800

1067
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,490
We've always taken a very simple
approach of, compress

1068
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:10,480
everything, pull out all the
white space, pull out all the

1069
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,280
comments, compress the graphics
as much as we can.

1070
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,220
Prior to pushing out to the
CDN, and eliminate steps.

1071
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,560
So I've see things like Yahoo
smush it, where you can upload

1072
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,895
a bunch of images, they come
back looking exactly the same

1073
00:55:24,895 --> 00:55:27,220
but much smaller.

1074
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,840
What I would love is an API that
we upload image, we send

1075
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,810
the image to the API, the API
comes back with an optimized

1076
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:39,250
lossless version of that
image, and then we

1077
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,100
push it to the CDN.

1078
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,220
If you're into custom
development.

1079
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,600
RICHARD RABBAT: So we actually
have something that's on the

1080
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:53,070
pagespeed online API part which
allows you to score the

1081
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,750
page against the pagespeed's
rules.

1082
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,900
We currently are going to give
you back results and tell you

1083
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,880
what you could have
done better.

1084
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,010
That's an interesting request
that we'll take into

1085
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,560
consideration.

1086
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,810
Thanks.

1087
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:10,670

1088
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,650
Hi, you mentioned that the
time to first byte on

1089
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,230
mod_pagespeed is slightly
increased because of the

1090
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:21,180
processing it does and some of
the optimization that applies.

1091
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,790
Could some of that stuff
be done offline in a

1092
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:24,920
pre-processing step?

1093
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,100
Say, before I deploy
my resources?

1094
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,890
JOSHUA MARANTZ: That's
a great question.

1095
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:35,180
Of course, all those things
could be done, but they have

1096
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,620
not yet been done.

1097
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,600
But for the majority of
websites, we've taken kind of

1098
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,280
a conservative approach to HTML
and assumed that it's

1099
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,940
fairly dynamic and often
personalized to the user so

1100
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,650
that caching HTML on the server
side is something that

1101
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,120
would not be our default
behavior.

1102
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,550
However, on the resource
optimization side,

1103
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,580
we already do that.

1104
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,470
Because we cache any
rewritten resource.

1105
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,450
So when I talked about that
overhead or that time to first

1106
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:10,890
byte, that's generally from
running it through the HTML

1107
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,090
filter, because we don't
cache the HTML.

1108
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:16,820
But we cache all of the
rewritten images and CSS files

1109
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,575
so we don't have to redo
those every time.

1110
00:57:19,575 --> 00:57:21,515
Thank you.

1111
00:57:21,515 --> 00:57:24,310
RICHARD RABBAT: Thank
you all for coming.

1112
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,100
I think a lot of people are
going to break for lunch now,

1113
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:32,030
so we're keeping you away from
your food, so please go ahead.

1114
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:34,433
