00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,367
Wan-Teh: My name is
Wan-Teh Chang.

2
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:05,968
I'm going to talk about
the network stack in Chromium.

3
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:10,634
A few minutes ago I sent
the URL for the slides

4
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:14,534
to Chrome team--the Chrome team
email address.

5
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:16,167
So if you have a laptop,

6
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,834
you can search for an email
from me.

7
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:22,834
And then you can look
at the slides.

8
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:27,901
So when a user types in a URL &mdash;
a universal resource locator &mdash;

9
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:32,100
the browser need to fetch
the resource from the network.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,334
And the network stack is
a component of Chromium

11
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:37,467
that actually goes
through the network to do that,

12
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:40,534
and also potentially
caches the resource

13
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:42,467
for the next time.

14
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:47,634
It's amazing that in the short
history of Chromium,

15
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:51,634
we have already written
the network stack price.

16
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,901
originally we started using
the WinINet library,

17
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,334
which is really a component
of IE.

18
00:00:57,334 --> 00:01:00,267
And we did that to get something
working very quickly.

19
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:05,033
And also, we believe that after
more than ten years at the web,

20
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:09,667
every OS should have a very good
BOT and HTTP library.

21
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:12,133
And we believe
that should be the case

22
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:15,367
for all the three major
platforms.

23
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,300
But we ran
into some problems,

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,467
so we switched to another
library called

25
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,000
WinHTTP on Windows.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,667
And it works mostly
just fine.

27
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,100
So that's what &mdash;

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,834
WinHTTP is actually
what's shipping in Chrome 1.0.

29
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:34,968
But gradually we will run into
some imitations of WinHTTP.

30
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,834
It's very difficult
to overcome those

31
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,601
without a source code.

32
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,534
I'll just name one example
is that

33
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,667
you cannot use WinHTTP
to download a file

34
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,434
larger than two gigabytes.

35
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:50,133
And these days,
with these dvd-rom images,

36
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:52,767
there are a lot of downloads
that are larger than that.

37
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:56,601
and there is no way
for us to overcome that.

38
00:01:56,601 --> 00:02:02,100
So last July we started
to realize that

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,100
it's really time to write
our own network stack.

40
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,501
And also we believe that
that will also help

41
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,300
the porting effort
to Mac and Linux.

42
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,701
So in Chrome 2.0 beta,

43
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:23,701
we are using our own
cross-platform network stack.

44
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:26,167
And this also &mdash;

45
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:29,033
One reason I mentioned earlier

46
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:32,033
is that it allows us
to fix bugs easier.

47
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:35,868
But we also have a lot of ideas
to improve performance.

48
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:41,033
So this allows us
to experiment with those ideas.

49
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:46,501
So in the source code, all
of our network stack source code

50
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:49,067
is under a single directory net.

51
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:53,367
And then under that, there are
several sub-directories.

52
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:58,000
And most of them have
very obvious names, like HTTP.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,267
The HTTP subdirectory contains
the implementation

54
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,000
of the HTTP protocol.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,968
And then, similarly, there is
another subdirectory for FTP.

56
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:09,234
And then there is
a subdirectory called

57
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:10,667
url_request.

58
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:14,334
And for most of you, that
directory is the most important

59
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:16,033
because that's really &mdash;

60
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:19,167
The rest of Chrome uses
the network stack.

61
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,934
They issue a URL request.

62
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:25,467
And the URL request
will create

63
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:31,467
the appropriate proto handle
to handle that URL request.

64
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:35,234
We also have a subdirectory
called proxy

65
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:40,400
to handle proxy
and get our system

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,567
proxy settings and so on.

67
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:47,567
And then there is a directory
underneath called Base &mdash;

68
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,868
Underneath Net called Base,

69
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:54,634
which contains the basic
socket implementation--SSL &mdash;

70
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,567
certificate handling,
and so on.

71
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:59,400
We also have our own test

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,567
that is only used
for our unitest.

73
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:05,701
So the network stack
is actually something

74
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:09,033
that is possible to use
independent of Chromium.

75
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:12,901
It has very little dependency
on the rest of Chromium.

76
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:15,400
We only depend
on three other components...

77
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,734
The Base component...

78
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:20,968
The V8 JavaScript interpreter

79
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:26,400
you only use for interpreting
the proxy auto-config files.

80
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,901
We also use the Google URL
library.

81
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:35,100
And then we use just a few
open-source libraries

82
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,267
to decode HTTP content
decoding, such as Zzip or Gzip.

83
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,567
So that's pretty much it.

84
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:45,300
And most of the code is
cross-platformed.

85
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,067
We hide platform-dependency
in a small number of files.

86
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:53,300
So if you need to port
the network stack

87
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,467
to a new platform,

88
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,534
you would just need to provide
the OS bindings

89
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:59,601
for RTCP sockets &mdash;
SSL sockets &mdash;

90
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:02,200
get in the system,
process settings.

91
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,400
Or how to access
the system certificate store.

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,067
That's it.

93
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:14,767
Then, if you need to use
the network stack,

94
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,868
it's useful to know
the threading model

95
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,300
and the IO model.

96
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,601
The threading model is
mostly single-threaded.

97
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,501
So we do most of the work
a single thread

98
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,934
called the IO thread.

99
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:30,934
This is useful to know
because this is why

100
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:33,534
a lot of data structures
in the network stack

101
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:39,534
don't need to be protected
by a lot.

102
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:44,334
And the IO model is
an asynchronized IO model.

103
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:47,567
So this means you initiate
an IO operation,

104
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:51,267
and we return immediately
a status code that says

105
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,033
it's in progress.

106
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:56,400
And then, when
the IO operation is done,

107
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,801
like the read, you say,
"I want to read."

108
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,901
When the data is received,

109
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,868
we will invoke your
Completion Callback

110
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:07,067
provided by you
on the same IO thread.

111
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:11,167
So they're just the model
we're using.

112
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:16,167
And this actually is true
for most of the classes

113
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,601
in the network stack,

114
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:21,667
except for the top level &mdash;
URL request class.

115
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:26,501
For that class we have
a delegate class

116
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:31,067
that provide more ways
to invoke the callbacks

117
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:37,067
for multiple events.

118
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:43,067
Then the next slide
is how the network stack

119
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:49,000
is integrated with Chromium.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The network stack, because
it needs to access the network,

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,467
is a privileged operation.

122
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:59,133
So it has to run
inside the browser process.

123
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:04,901
The renderer is the one
that actually initiates

124
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:10,234
the loading of a resource
that starts from WebCATS.

125
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:12,567
The web--internet engine.

126
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:16,400
So that load resource request
goes through IPC

127
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,534
to the browser process.

128
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:21,667
And then there is a class
in the browser process

129
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,467
called the resource
dispatcher host.

130
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:26,634
That is responsible
for issuing

131
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:31,868
the URL request
from the renderer processes

132
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,534
through the network stack.

133
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:36,534
So that is a very important
entry point

134
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:41,834
into the network stack.

135
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,467
But there is another
entry point

136
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:47,634
into the network stack
called the URL fetcher.

137
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:52,167
And that is used
only for URL requests,

138
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,501
generated by Chromium itself.

139
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:57,801
Such as visiting
the safe-browsing server,

140
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,367
or carrying navigation
suggestions,

141
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:04,801
or sending usage statistics
to our UMA servers.

142
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:10,534
So at this point I'm going
to turn over to Eric Roman

143
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:15,901
to go into the network stack
in more detail.

144
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,968
Roman: Hey, so I'm gonna talk
a little bit about

145
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:31,167
the programming model
for how you actually end up

146
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,100
issuing network requests,

147
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,868
and some of the layers
that we'll pass through

148
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,501
as you do this.

149
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,767
So the main header file
you'd want to check,

150
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,901
if you're going to be
programming a network request,

151
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,601
is urlrequest.h.

152
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:46,734
And this describes how to use
the URL request objects,

153
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,834
which is the main entry point
into the network stack.

154
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:52,334
So when you construct
the URL request,

155
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:55,934
you're going to specify
the URL that you want to fetch,

156
00:08:55,934 --> 00:09:00,601
as well as the URL request
delegate object.

157
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:04,300
And the delegate object is
how you receive notification

158
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
of events
during the network fetch.

159
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,767
So you'll get &mdash;
you specify, essentially,

160
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,801
callbacks for when
the response has started.

161
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,033
When the response has completed.

162
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:18,801
When you get a repeater act,
when authentication's required.

163
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:23,100
And so the URL request object,
once you've constructed it,

164
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,300
you just call "start,"

165
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,234
and it begins
issuing the stuff synchronously,

166
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,434
and your delegate will
get called

167
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:32,601
to notify those various events.

168
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:37,834
So the other thing you have
to specify to your request

169
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:40,334
is the URL request context.

170
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:43,934
And the context is essentially
the global state

171
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,300
that's shared between
network requests.

172
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,133
So this includes
the cookie store,

173
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:52,968
the HTTP cache, the various
network session state...

174
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:56,267
auth cache,
the client socket pool,

175
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:58,567
and proxy service.

176
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,667
And usually
the URL request contacts...

177
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,367
you can think of it
as one per browser.

178
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:07,067
And so all requests
you do

179
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,601
will be sharing
this same state.

180
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:11,400
So they share
the same cookie store.

181
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,934
They share the same
HTTP cache.

182
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:15,934
The exception is
with incognito mode,

183
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:19,100
where you'd actually specify
a different URL request contact

184
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,701
that you can substitute in
an in-memory cookie store,

185
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:25,400
and in-memory cache.

186
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,701
So I guess we'll just
step through a sample request &mdash;

187
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,968
what happens
when you issue,

188
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:33,467
let's say an HTTPS
or HTTP request.

189
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:51,834
So if you have the &mdash;
Can you hear me?

190
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:52,934
So if you have the slides,

191
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,434
you can follow along
on those as well.

192
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:57,300
I'll try and reproduce
the similar diagram.

193
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:26,834
Okay, so, we'll start with
the URL request object.

194
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:31,033
The arrows here represent
dependencies

195
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:35,133
and sort of flow
of execution.

196
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,801
So we're going to pass in
the delegate object,

197
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:42,968
which is how we get called back
when events complete.

198
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:45,100
And we also pass
the URL request contacts,

199
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,501
which holds all
of our global state.

200
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,968
So we're first going to
pass into the &mdash;

201
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:53,801
The URL request is going to
look at the scheme of the URL.

202
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,901
It's going to determine
what type of job to create.

203
00:12:55,901 --> 00:13:01,601
So since we support FTP file,
URLs, HTTP, HTTPS,

204
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:05,434
this is where it determines
which specific type of jobs

205
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,534
used for this request.

206
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:08,267
So in our hypothetical
situation,

207
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,234
we'll be using
an HTTPS request.

208
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:11,767
So what it's going to do is
it's going to create

209
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,634
a URL request HTTP drop.

210
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:17,133
And the URL request HTTP drop,
at this layer,

211
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,767
it applies filters.

212
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:22,434
And it's also going to read
and write the cookie store.

213
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,200
So we'll just write
the cookie store here.

214
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,868
And the cookie store
comes from

215
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:33,868
the URL request contacts.

216
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:38,234
So after--we're going to
go down to the next layer.

217
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,300
This is the HTTP cache
transaction.

218
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,567
And this is going to enforce
the HTTP cache stuff.

219
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,667
So it also has a dependency now
for more stake

220
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:50,734
coming from the URL request
contacts,

221
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:53,667
which is the HTTP cache.

222
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,734
And that's also
part of URL requests contacts.

223
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:02,834
So if the HTTP &mdash;

224
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,634
If the request
can be serviced from cache,

225
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:07,868
it's gonna stop at this layer,
and sort of return that.

226
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:10,601
If not, then it's going to
have to actually do

227
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,033
a real transaction
on the network.

228
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:15,133
So it's going to go down
to the next layer,

229
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:18,033
which is the HTTP network
transaction.

230
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,901
And this is where
the real details

231
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,968
of the HTTP protocol
are implemented.

232
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:24,400
So reading and writing
the headers,

233
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,868
understanding response codes &mdash;

234
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:29,167
most of that logic is
in HTTP network transaction.

235
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,267
And it's going to, like,
apply authentication,

236
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:33,367
apply the proxy.

237
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:38,667
So at this layer,
it's going to rely

238
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,000
on quite a bit of state
from URL request contacts.

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,100
And most of this is
in HTTP network session.

240
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,667
So this is indirectly part
of URL request contacts.

241
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,667
It's contained in that.

242
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:05,601
And so your HTTP session
contains various things.

243
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:11,267
IT contains the HTTP cache...

244
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:15,200
the client socket pool,
proxy service.

245
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,868
A lot of stuff from here
as well.

246
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:19,534
So we'll draw in
a couple of those.

247
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay, and then, so now we're
near the bottom of the stack.

248
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And now we hav--the final levels
are the socket levels.

249
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,400
So if this were an HTTP request,
we'd be talking

250
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,868
to the client socket interface.

251
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:49,367
We'd be talking to
SSL client socket.

252
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,701
So we'll just put that
in here.

253
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:04,534
And so this would essentially
wrap a transport socket,

254
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:07,267
which would just be
our TCP client socket.

255
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:14,300
And then, obviously, here
we're actually just

256
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,234
talking down to the network.

257
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:24,634
So lastly,

258
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:26,834
just gonna talk a little
about the tests.

259
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,434
So if you're going to be
working the network stack,

260
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,033
and you make modifications,

261
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,567
you obviously want
a unit test.

262
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,934
So to run the unit test,

263
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:40,634
you just use the net unit test
target.

264
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:43,968
And most of the tests use
mock dependencies.

265
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:47,000
For, like, at the socket level
or, you know,

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,934
mock proxy services,
whatever.

267
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,767
There are some exceptions.

268
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,133
As once I mentioned,
we also have the test server.

269
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:56,000
And the test server is
a Python application,

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,133
where you can create
custom responses

271
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:05,000
or handlers for special tests.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,968
So that's also an option.

273
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:13,701
So, yeah.

274
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,801
And there's a bunch
of resources for &mdash;

275
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,834
You can check out
the network stack road map,

276
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:21,100
the DNS prefetching document
page.

277
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,667
There's documentation
on disk cache,

278
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,934
if you want more information.

279
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,968
There's some links
in the slides.

280
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:29,701
And I guess lastly,

281
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:34,901
Wan-Teh and I can
answer questions.

282
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,334
Yes.

283
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:38,801
Roman: So Wan-Teh mentioned
reasons for switching away

284
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:41,033
from WinINet and and WinHTTP.

285
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:44,901
Can you guys reiterate
some of the other reasons

286
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:49,100
besides the two-gigabyte
file download limit on WinHTTP?

287
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,534
Why we ended up ditching,
like, WinINet, for example?

288
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:58,000
So the question was to elaborate
a bit on, you know,

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,367
why we chose to ditch WinINet
and WinHTTP.

290
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:04,634
So he mentioned
there were some bugs.

291
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:06,434
in particular, like,
not being able

292
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:09,167
to do file downloads
over two gigabytes,

293
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:13,133
and with some other &mdash;
I think Wan-Teh will &mdash;

294
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,968
Wan-Teh: So with WinINet,
we basically ran into

295
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:17,300
two major problems.

296
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,267
The first one is that
we cannot get the certificate &mdash;

297
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,067
the service certificate.

298
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,801
And this is critical

299
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:28,367
when you handle
an SSL certificate error.

300
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,734
So that one we actually went
to extraordinary measure--means.

301
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:34,934
And we were able
to get the certificate

302
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:37,100
by patching WinINet.

303
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,534
But the other one
that we cannot surmount

304
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:42,801
was that it's impossible
to tell WinINet

305
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:45,000
to bypass its own cache.

306
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,801
And we know that some server
generates dynamic content

307
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:52,467
based on the browser's
user agent.

308
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:58,267
So we do not want to share
the cache with IE.

309
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:01,801
So that's really the reason
we had to switch

310
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:03,934
to a new library.

311
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:08,100
For WinHTTP, we could tell
that it shares some code

312
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,367
with WinINet.

313
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:12,467
But probably because
it's not used in IE.

314
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:18,033
The shared code is older,
so it has some bugs.

315
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:22,033
Security bugs that had already
been fixed in IE's version.

316
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:25,634
So we are quite unhappy
about that.

317
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:31,634
And it also had some problem
that caused system crashes &mdash;

318
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,934
blue screens on some laptops.

319
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:39,934
That one we were also able
to find--work around.

320
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:43,000
But in the end we just thought
that there are

321
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,634
too many issues.

322
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:50,234
And the porting to Mac
and Linux was going to start.

323
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:54,868
So we thought it's time
to write our own.

324
00:19:54,868 --> 00:20:00,267
man: So on Mac and Linux,
what's the lay of the land

325
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:04,067
with regard to existing platform
network implementations,

326
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:06,267
and whether they're
better or worse?

327
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,100
The same for us as &mdash;

328
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,968
Wan-Teh: Okay.

329
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:13,033
So Peter asked about the system
networking libraries

330
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:16,667
on Mac and Linux,
and their quality.

331
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,968
On the Mac,
I know there is a library

332
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,634
called CFNetwork.

333
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,834
I guess it stands for
Core Foundation Network.

334
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,100
That's used by Safari.

335
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,834
So I thought that should be
pretty good.

336
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:31,734
But I don't have any
personal experience using it.

337
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:35,000
Linux, the usual problem is
not whether there is one.

338
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,133
The problem is
there are too many,

339
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,567
and you need to pick one.

340
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:42,400
So I thought on Linux &mdash;
we were considering LibCurl.

341
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,234
That's quite popular.

342
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,400
And there's another one
called Lib Neon

343
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
that's used by the SBN client.

344
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,200
I think both would
probably work well.

345
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,200
But in the end, we just thought
it better to write our own.

346
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,400
And the network stack,
it turns out,

347
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,067
is not really that complicated

348
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,167
Especially the core portion.

349
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:07,200
So basically Darin Fisher
wrote it within a week.

350
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
And it was able to do TCP &mdash;

351
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,734
regular TTP requests &mdash;
HTTP requests.

352
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:17,501
man: I'm just curious.

353
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,734
Are we headed in the direction
of being able

354
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:23,734
to have our own proxy settings
and our own certificate store,

355
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:25,834
and not rely on the system
for that?

356
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,901
Um, okay...
so the question is &mdash;

357
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:31,567
Right now we're using
the system proxy settings

358
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,067
and the system certificate
store.

359
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:37,267
So the question is whether
we're going to support

360
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:41,167
our own proxy settings
and a certificate store.

361
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:45,067
I think the answer is &mdash;
I have two different answers.

362
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,667
For a certificate store,
I still think

363
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:50,801
it's very important to share
the system cert store

364
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:53,234
with other applications.

365
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:56,300
And we haven't received
any complaints

366
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,601
about our using
the Windows system store.

367
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:02,434
But with the proxy settings,

368
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:08,267
we do get a lot of complaints
from some Firefox users.

369
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:12,000
Basically,
their problem is that

370
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,033
they use
the same laptop at work

371
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,601
and at home.

372
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,701
And they have to use
the system proxy settings

373
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:21,267
with IE at work.

374
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:24,968
But for some reason
they want to use &mdash;

375
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,133
When they use Firefox,

376
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,868
they want to use
a different set of settings

377
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:30,634
that's appropriate
for their home network.

378
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:34,067
And these Firefox users
told us

379
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:37,167
that they cannot use Chrome
because of this reason.

380
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:40,267
So we are seriously
considering adding

381
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:44,834
our own proxy settings.

382
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:49,467
man: What are the real-world
web-compat ramifications

383
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:52,667
of different network stacks,
especially rolling our own?

384
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:55,767
Wan-Teh: So the question is

385
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,767
what are the real-world
ramifications

386
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,467
of network stacks?

387
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,567
Especially when writing
our own.

388
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:05,868
man: For website compatibility.

389
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:08,801
Wan-Teh: our experience is
that &mdash;

390
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:13,734
So working on network, I think,
is similar to our layout.

391
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:16,701
On the one hand, you need
to implement a standard.

392
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:19,167
But on the other hand,
you also need to be

393
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:22,701
somewhat permissive
of broken implementations.

394
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:27,501
So our approach has been that
we're trying to be

395
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:29,934
as strict as possible.

396
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:34,801
And when we run into
incompatibility,

397
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:38,267
we make our best effort
to contact the site,

398
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:39,667
to correct it.

399
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,100
Or sometimes contact &mdash;

400
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,300
if they are using open-source
server product,

401
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,601
we try to file a bug report.

402
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:50,067
But usually that takes
a lot of effort.

403
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:53,634
So we also have to implement
work-arounds

404
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:57,634
for some
of the incompatibilites.

405
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:07,267
Any other questions?

406
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:09,033
Okay, thank you.

407
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:12,334
