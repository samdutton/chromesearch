00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:43,970

00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,780
PETE LEPAGE: Well
hello, everyone.

3
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,690
My name is Pete LePage.

4
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,200
And I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,910
And today we're going to be
talking more about using great

6
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,710
tools for building mobile
web applications.

7
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,810
Last week, some of you may have
joined me for a special

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,260
Chrome Developer Tools session,
Mobile Developer

9
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,450
Tools session, where we talked
about some of the really neat

10
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,590
tools that you can use,
like libraries and

11
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,310
other stuff like that.

12
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,950
This week, we're going to talk
about testing and emulation

13
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,100
and other great tools that
you'll find will help you to

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,570
build great mobile
applications.

15
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,210
So like I said, welcome.

16
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,020

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,120
So last week &mdash;

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,870
the link to the slides
is there.

19
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,960
There's the Development
Environments stuff that we

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,360
talked about, the Authoring
Framework stuff, as well as

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,040
some of the libraries.

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,350
This week, it's the Testing and
Iteration Flow and some

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,020
Performance Tooling.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,910
If you're looking for some other
great tools, Paul Irish

25
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,860
has a great session on the
Tooling and Web App

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,470
Development stack that
you can check out.

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,050
And these slides will
be available

28
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,850
after the fact as well.

29
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,430
If you want to go and follow
along or ask questions as

30
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,780
we're going, the link is there
at the bottom, right here.

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,250
Well, I guess it is not quite
highlighting for me right now.

32
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,430
But you can see the link
at the very bottom.

33
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,110
If you have questions, you
want to post those.

34
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,020
Feel free to go post your
questions as we move along.

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,260
And I'll take your questions
as we go and at

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,400
the end of the session.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
So let's jump in and talk about
some testing tools and

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,020
ways that you can better test
and see how your environment

39
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,870
works when you're building
mobile web applications.

40
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,000
So one of the first things I
want to talk about is the

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,760
network link conditioners and
really sort of understanding

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,170
how you can better understand
and better test the

43
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,630
experiences that you're getting,
when your users are

44
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,820
experiencing their websites
on a mobile device.

45
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,250
Because on a mobile device,
you can't always count on

46
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,870
having a 3G connection.

47
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,330
Sometimes it may be Edge.

48
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,880
Sometimes, it may be Wi-Fi.

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,770
Sometimes that Wi-Fi may be
worse than a 3G connection.

50
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,850
Sometimes it may be
really spotty.

51
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,810
Sometimes it may not
exist at all.

52
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,120
So there are some great tools
that are available for testing

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,050
on your mobile device.

54
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,240
There's two that I think are
really interesting &mdash;

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,230
Charles Proxy, which
is available there.

56
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,250
It's available for the PC, for
the Mac, and for Linux.

57
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,050
So you can install
it on whatever

58
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,260
platform you're using.

59
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,550
And it will go and basically
proxy all the network

60
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,080
connections.

61
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,500
So all the requests that
are going through go

62
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,350
through that proxy.

63
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,290
And you can specify how
you want it to behave.

64
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,050
The other one that's pretty
interesting is the Network

65
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,120
Link Conditioner.

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,350
And this is a Mac tool.

67
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,210
This is something that you need
to get through the Apple

68
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,010
developer tools.

69
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,620
So when you install Xcode,
you can get it there.

70
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,740
And the Network Link Conditioner
is installed in

71
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,400
your system settings.

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,710
Let me bring it up here.

73
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,950
So I'll bring up my tools,
my System Preferences.

74
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,600
And down here at the bottom, you
can see this Network Link

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,520
Conditioner.

76
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,250
So when I start the Network
Link Conditioner, I have a

77
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,450
couple of options that
I can choose from.

78
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,460
I can choose the profile
and whether I want to

79
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,940
turn it on or off.

80
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,610
So first off, let's
go and turn it on.

81
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,970
But let's turn it on for an
Edge Good Connectivity.

82
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,020
So if I do this, you
can see a couple of

83
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,390
things get set by default.

84
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,750
It limits the bandwidth that my
device can connect to the

85
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,730
network with.

86
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,810
So I no longer have the full
network bandwidth available.

87
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:39,130
I only have a 256K
kilobit stream.

88
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,790
Also, I'm not going to
drop any packets.

89
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,060
But it's going at 350
millisecond delay to all of my

90
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,590
requests on the downlink.

91
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,300
On the uplink, it's going to put
in 200K connection speed

92
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,200
and a delay of about
370 milliseconds.

93
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,390
So by turning that stuff on,
it's going to slow your

94
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,320
network connection down.

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,570
It's going to cause some
pretty slow things.

96
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,120
So I'm going to bring up my
website because I know my

97
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,310
website is probably not exactly
designed for a slow

98
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,500
connection &mdash; so petelepage.com.

99
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,030
And you'll notice it takes
a little while for

100
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,360
stuff to come in.

101
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,940
And it takes that extra time.

102
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,180
So basically, what it's doing
is pruning down my network.

103
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,640
It's making my pipe smaller,
so to speak.

104
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,200
So that way you can get a
better idea of how your

105
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,600
network is going to behave
under low bandwidth

106
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,270
connections.

107
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,370
It's a really good way of
testing and understanding.

108
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,770
Through here, you could
also go in.

109
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,300
And you can set things like hey,
I want to see what a LASI

110
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,330
network is going to look like.

111
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,630
So notice here, we've got 1%
packet dropped and a 440

112
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,780
millisecond delay.

113
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,920
I guess it really helps
to turn this guy on.

114
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,560
So I'm going to go ahead
and turn this on.

115
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,190
I have to enter in
my password, so

116
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,680
turn my password on.

117
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,860
Let's just make sure I
got turned on here &mdash;

118
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,990
on.

119
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,100
So now, petelepage.com &mdash;

120
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,890
I guess I didn't get
it on earlier.

121
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,270
So now, let's see how long
this takes to load.

122
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,490
Again, much slower, so
before, we saw it

123
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,240
load reasonably fast.

124
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,330
Now, we're still waiting
for content come down.

125
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,350
We don't have that section
on the right.

126
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,370
So I can see that the important
content on my

127
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,530
personal website comes
up pretty quickly.

128
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,460
The thing that I want people to
be able to see here, on the

129
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,870
Thinking About, comes
up pretty quick.

130
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,570
But the other content is going
to take a while to load.

131
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,260
When the Network Conditioner
is running, you've got this

132
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,340
little guy up here telling you,
hey, it's up and running.

133
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,170
And so you can bring it up
really easily, if you

134
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,960
want to change it.

135
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,860
If you want to go and say, hey,
I'm on 3G or whatever,

136
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,440
you can turn that on and off
pretty quickly &mdash; really

137
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,350
easily, without having to go
fight through lots of stuff.

138
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,200
It's a good tool to be able
to use and understand.

139
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,910
Charles Proxy is a really
powerful as well.

140
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,370
Charles Proxy &mdash; one of the great
things about it is it'll

141
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,880
do all of your network
connections.

142
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,600
And it gives you a lot more
inspection ability.

143
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,010
So you can go in and see
what's going on with a

144
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,920
particular request.

145
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,870
You could take one specific
request and

146
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,970
make it take forever.

147
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,860
So you drop one specific
request, if you're doing a lot

148
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,610
of XHR requests or something
to that effect.

149
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,840
It's a good way to be able
to specify some of

150
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,550
those things in there.

151
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,220
On Android, if you want
to do this on a

152
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,970
phone or on a tablet.

153
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,780
You can do it on a phone
or tablet as well.

154
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,640
On Android, you can set up
the proxy to go through a

155
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,030
particular device.

156
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,465
So it's kind of buried
in there.

157
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:50,580
I'll get a blog post out or
something up on the Chrome

158
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,450
developers page in the next day
or so, to talk about that.

159
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,010
But you can go in, and you can
turn that proxy on, so that

160
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,020
you can actually use that.

161
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:05,040
Under iOS 6, if you have the
developer tools turned on, you

162
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,200
can turn on the Network Link
Conditioner in there as well.

163
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,250
So that you can see how the
network conditioner works on

164
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,360
that particular device.

165
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,950
You can test it, again, in
a specific scenario, to

166
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,870
understand how things are going
to work, how they're

167
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,930
going to behave.

168
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,370
So let's go ahead and close
that and go back

169
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,930
to our slides here.

170
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,770
So faking it with the Network
Link Conditioner is just one

171
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:37,730
way that you can understand how
your app is going to work

172
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,700
for your users, who may not be
connecting with the same great

173
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,600
bandwidth that you're
connecting with.

174
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,470
One of the next things I want
to talk about is some of the

175
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,460
developer tools within Chrome.

176
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,460
Because Chrome offers a lot of
great tools to help you test

177
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,530
your web application.

178
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,530
And I call it faking it
because it provides an

179
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,450
emulation experience.

180
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,250
It's not going to be a true
experience because you're not

181
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,020
running on the same hardware.

182
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,610
The processor on my Chrome OS
machine or on my Mac or

183
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,530
anything like that is obviously
much faster than it

184
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,690
is on my phone or tablet.

185
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,600
But at least I can be able
to go, understand

186
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,670
what's going on.

187
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,580
And I can get a pretty
good sense of how

188
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,030
these things are working.

189
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,290
So there's a couple of things
that you can do in the Chrome

190
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,010
Developer Tools.

191
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,880
So I'm going to bring up the
Chrome Developer Tools now, so

192
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,230
that we can see what's
going on here.

193
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,900
So I've got the developer
tools up.

194
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,415
And I'm going to click on this
little guy here in the bottom,

195
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:41,510
the little gears icon
for the settings.

196
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,880
When I bring up the settings,
if I go to Overrides, I can

197
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,430
change a number of
Chrome settings.

198
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,530
So first off, I can change
my user agent.

199
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:57,300
So I can fake out to my server
what browser I'm running as.

200
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,210
So I could say, hey, I'm running
as an iPhone iOS 4.

201
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,820
And so sure enough, it shows
here what my user agent is.

202
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,280
You can see it showing
up there.

203
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,410
But it also automatically turns
on the device metrics.

204
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,430
Now this is one of those things
that I think is really

205
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,860
powerful and really, really
useful to web developers.

206
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,290
Because what it does is sets the
screen resolution to the

207
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,920
same screen resolution
that I would get if

208
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,000
I was on that device.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,340
So in this particular case,
it's got 640 by 960.

210
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,150
So it's setting my screen
resolution to the right size.

211
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,990
It turns on a font-scale factor,
whether it's going to

212
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,730
scale my fonts or not.

213
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,350
So you've got the
device metrics.

214
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,580
So you can see what
your experience is

215
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,750
going to look like &mdash;

216
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,780
much easier to do this than it
is to resize your browser.

217
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,760
I'm sure everybody has done it
here before, where you try and

218
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,850
resize your browser down to
exactly the right size.

219
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,230
And getting it to that
particular size you want is

220
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,890
just a pain in the butt.

221
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,730
So this is a good way to be able
to go in and say, hey, I

222
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,320
need a particular screen size.

223
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,830
So sure enough, there's
the screen size.

224
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,780
You can see these things are
rendering as I expected it.

225
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,645
One of the next things that you
can do is overriding the

226
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,090
geolocation position.

227
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,990
So you can fake out to the
browser where you are.

228
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,910
If you want to say, hey
look, I'm in New York.

229
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,740
Or I'm in Mountain View.

230
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,320
Or I want to go test
something.

231
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,860
You can go in, and you can
specify the latitude here and

232
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,070
the longitude here.

233
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,500
So that you can say, hey, this
is where I am right now.

234
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,400
I want to just take my word for
it that this is where I

235
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,730
am, in case you're doing any
kind of geolocation testing.

236
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,810
And you can also say, in
particular, I want to emulate

237
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,110
a particular position.

238
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,400
So I want to say emulate
position unavailable, which

239
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,550
may happen, maybe, if you're
in a nice cement room where

240
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,910
you can get a location.

241
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,930
Or maybe just the user chooses
not to provide a device

242
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,600
location, going in and being
able to specify exactly the

243
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,290
location or whether the location
is not available &mdash;

244
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,240
another one.

245
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,890
You can go in.

246
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,760
And you could also do device
orientation, how the device is

247
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,990
with the alpha, beta,
and gamma channel.

248
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,580
And there's a great article up
on HTML5 Rocks, if you want to

249
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,570
understand how those
guys work.

250
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:29,030
One thing to keep in mind when
you think about that is all of

251
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,960
the alpha, beta, gamma
is how you would

252
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,230
normally hold the device.

253
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,180
So in some cases, I'd hold
my device like this.

254
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,050
But on a different device,
you might hold it like

255
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,520
this or like this.

256
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,520
So both of those are all things
that you need to take

257
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,970
into account for the device
orientation and

258
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,640
device motion stuff.

259
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,110
Finally, on here, you can see
the Emulate Touch Events.

260
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,220
So that's going to simulate
touch events and fire the

261
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,400
touch events at the same,
when I click on things.

262
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,930
So those are all available.

263
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,460
I think Device Orientation
is available in beta.

264
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,030
It's not available in the
stable channel yet.

265
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,700
So if you need to go
in and check, you

266
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,940
want try one of those.

267
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,980
Go have a quick peek in the in
the beta or even in the Dev or

268
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,320
Canary or even in the
Chromium Channel.

269
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,370
There's a couple of new ones
that are coming soon.

270
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,630
Let me pull up Chromium for a
sec because I think this one's

271
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,226
kind of neat.

272
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:28,440
So I'll bring up
Chromium here.

273
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,400
And I'll just go to google.com,
bring up the

274
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,830
developer tools.

275
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,470
Again, same thing, go click
on the little guy here.

276
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:42,870
And under overrides, I now also
have Emulate CSS Media.

277
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,390
So that I can go in and say,
hey, in this particular case,

278
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,720
I want you to pretend that
I'm a print device.

279
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,360
And I want you to show me what
the page is going to look

280
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,830
like, if you're applying
the print style.

281
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,850
Rather than having to go hit
print every single time to see

282
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,890
what it looks like and look in
the print preview, you can

283
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,740
just go apply that
print style.

284
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,860
Maybe you want to go to use a
different one, like screen or

285
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,210
projection or something
like that.

286
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,900
You can go see how all
of those look.

287
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,060
So easy way to go do this &mdash;
and if you're ever curious

288
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,950
about what's coming and what's
down the pike, always check

289
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,110
out Chromium.

290
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,480
My general recommendation, if
you're sort of looking to stay

291
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,840
on the edge, but you want
something pretty stable.

292
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,250
And you want to be
able to test some

293
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,630
of the newer features.

294
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,270
It's to install Chrome Beta or
Chrome Stable as your primary

295
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,300
browser experience and then
install either Chrome Canary

296
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,200
or Chromium itself.

297
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,940
And that way, you'll always
have the latest.

298
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,970
You'll always have
the greatest.

299
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,710
You can see what's going on
in the fun new stuff.

300
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,170
And you can see what's
going on in the

301
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,270
stable, regular thing &mdash;

302
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,950
how most of your users are
going to see things.

303
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,620
I personally like
to go with beta.

304
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,900
So that way, I'm a little
bit ahead of the curve.

305
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,310
And if the bug gets introduced
on something or maybe

306
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,350
something changes, I'm going to
see it before my users are.

307
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,810
And that, to me, is
really important.

308
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,130
I want to know about these
things before my users do

309
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,660
because I want to make sure
that I've got a great

310
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,680
experience.

311
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,860
So a bunch of great
Chrome dev tools &mdash;

312
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,840
there's a bunch of great
sessions available on Google

313
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,510
Developer Live that go into much
more depth on how to use

314
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,540
some of these dev tools.

315
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,440
I just sort of wanted to give
you a good introduction to do

316
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,210
a couple of these things.

317
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,460
So let's move on to the
next one and talk

318
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,190
about some of the emulators.

319
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,500
Emulators are a great way to
get an idea of how things

320
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,040
might work.

321
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,230
Is it going to behave how you
expect it to behave in the

322
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,740
native environment?

323
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,210
Now again, you're not going to
get the exact performance

324
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,120
characteristics.

325
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,000
And there are some things
that may or may

326
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,630
not work in the emulator.

327
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,210
For example, the camera doesn't
work in the emulator

328
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,430
for most of these devices.

329
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,010
But it does work in
other places.

330
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,510
So it does work on the device.

331
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,000
But most other things work.

332
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,880
So there's a few places where
this is a good way

333
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,560
to go and do this.

334
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,570
So there's a couple of good
emulators available.

335
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,180
There's the Android emulator,
which I've got linked there.

336
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,520
It's a quick, easy
thing to install.

337
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,790
It's not exactly the
fastest thing.

338
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,970
But it's pretty decent.

339
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,090
And it does give a fair
representation.

340
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,740
If you install Xcode, you can go
and get the iOS simulators,

341
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,300
which will give you the iPhone
and iPad, the iPhone

342
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,640
5, the iPhone 4.

343
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,310
In fact, it'll give
you quite a few.

344
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,380
Let me bring up one of
the iOS simulators.

345
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,820
So when I bring up the
iOS simulator, sure

346
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,780
enough, here we go.

347
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,250
We've got Safari running
right now.

348
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,450
Let me make this a little
bit smaller, so that

349
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,980
it's nice and small.

350
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,780
Here we go.

351
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,940
So you can see that I've
got Safari on here.

352
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,970
I can start Safari.

353
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,380
It starts up pretty quick.

354
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,109
If I go to type in here, I can
go click on this and type

355
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,099
HTML5rocks.com.

356
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,260
It just uses my network
connection to go pull this

357
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,710
stuff down, shows me
exactly as I would

358
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,270
expect things to be.

359
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,180
So in this particular case &mdash;

360
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,829
and it also responds
to touch events.

361
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:27,109
So in order to scroll, what I
have to do is go click on the

362
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,590
page and then scroll up.

363
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,680
So I've got that sort of real
experience, as I'd expect it

364
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,780
to behave on a true device.

365
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,940
If I go back up to the top and
I want to go search here, I

366
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,510
can click on in here.

367
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,850
And if I wanted to type &mdash; so
I said device orientation.

368
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,420

369
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,530
You can see this would take me
forever &mdash; device orientation.

370
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,090
So sure enough, I go
click on that.

371
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,340
I should get some
results here.

372
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,140
And sure enough, here's that
device orientation article

373
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,900
that I was talking
about earlier.

374
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,300
So we can go through, scroll,
and see all the stuff that

375
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,090
we're looking for.

376
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,150
So there's a good, easy
way to be able to

377
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,690
go in and test this.

378
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,370
You can switch between
different hardware.

379
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,100
So you can change from the iPad
to the iPad Retina to an

380
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,350
iPhone, whatever you're
looking to test.

381
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,850
That same is true for
Android as well.

382
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,480
You can try different devices.

383
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,390
You could try different
characteristics on those

384
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,230
devices, whether they have a
keyboard, whether they don't

385
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,530
have a hardware keyboard &mdash;

386
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,160
so quick easy way to be able
to go in and do these guys.

387
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,740
So let's go back to our
slides here and

388
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,880
continue on from here.

389
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,560
The other one that's worth
checking out is Browser Stack.

390
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,970
Browser Stack is a great tool
that you give it a link to

391
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,630
your site, and it'll go render
it in several different

392
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,610
browsers and give you
the screen shots.

393
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,980
And in fact, I believe on this
one even gives you access to

394
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,740
the DOM, which is
pretty slick.

395
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,280
Because you can go in, and you
can try seeing how things

396
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,520
behave in the DOM.

397
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,130
But emulators are
only so good.

398
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,530
We want to be able to test
these on real devices,

399
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,800
understand how these are going
to behave in a real scenario.

400
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,130
So let's have a look at
how you'd use one

401
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,190
of the remote debuggers.

402
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,240
And actually, we'll have
a look at a couple

403
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,030
of the remote debuggers.

404
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,780
You can do remote debugging with
Chrome for Android on an

405
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,930
Android device.

406
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:31,820
You can do with us Safari
on iOS 5 and Safari 6.

407
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,270
And you can actually do
it on Firefox as well.

408
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,090
And I've got all the slides
that walk you through the

409
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,830
instructions on how
to do this.

410
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,530
And you can follow
the instructions

411
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,340
along on your own.

412
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,620
So for Android, the first thing
you've got to do is &mdash;

413
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,400
on all of these, there's a
one-time set-up experience.

414
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
You have to go set a few things
up, turn debugging on,

415
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,040
that kind of thing.

416
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,190
So for Android, we need
to install the

417
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,970
debugger for the SDK first.

418
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,150
Once we've done that on our
mobile device, we need to

419
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,580
enable USB debugging
at the OS level.

420
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,380
If you've got a phone that has
not ever gone into developer

421
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,060
mode before, you're going to
have to go through clicking &mdash;

422
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,570
I think it's you click on the
About Phone Settings like

423
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,280
seven times.

424
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,650
And that brings it up.

425
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,060
If you can find the developer
USB Developer Options in the

426
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,950
Settings menu, just
a quick search.

427
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,480
You'll find it pretty quickly.

428
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,880
Once you've got that done, we
need to open up Chrome and we

429
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:40,870
need to enabled the web debugger
within Chrome.

430
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,750
So once you've done all
that basic stuff &mdash;

431
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,130
I've already done all that
stuff on my device.

432
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,370
Let me bring up the
device down here.

433
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,050
So I've got my device.

434
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,800
And I'm going to
unlock it here.

435
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,550
So let's bring up Chrome.

436
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,510
And so we'll go to
HTML5 Rocks.

437
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,760
I'm just going to
grab my phone &mdash;

438
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,170
so HTML5 Rocks.

439
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,100

440
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,370
And this will take a
second and load.

441
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,760
Let me zoom this in just a
little bit, so you can see

442
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,720
this a little bit better.

443
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,080
All right.

444
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,970
So now that we've got this,
there's a couple of things

445
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,790
that we need to do.

446
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,890
On our desktop, I'm
going to come out.

447
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,370
And we need to run
ADB forward.

448
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,310
Now, I have this set
up as a script.

449
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,720
So I'll just show you
what my script says.

450
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,160
So you can see here it's adb
forward tcp 9222 and then

451
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,650
local abstract.

452
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,800
I recommend just having a
little script to do this

453
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,870
because it's a heck of a lot
easier than it is to go and

454
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,380
remember that all the time.

455
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,680
But what this does is it
connects through my USB port

456
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,850
to my device and allows me
to do remote debugging.

457
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,090
So I'll do Clank Debug.

458
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,320
It's gone and run.

459
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,210
So now, when we go back
to Chrome, let's

460
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,670
go open a new tab.

461
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:12,210
And we'll go to local
host colon 9222.

462
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,160
So at this point, we get two
windows that pop up.

463
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,350
So we've got the Mobile Web
Developer Toolkit and the

464
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,340
HTML5 Rocks.

465
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,020
So when I click on this, it
opens up the dev tools, just

466
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,660
like I'm used to seeing
on my computer.

467
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,600
But this is now showing
everything

468
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,280
on the mobile device.

469
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,540
Now, I've got the standard
resources, so I can go see all

470
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,580
the files that have
been pulled down.

471
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,260
I can go.

472
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,050
And if we reload this page &mdash; so
let me go hit reload here &mdash;

473
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,500
you can see all of the network
requests coming in.

474
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,090
So we could see how everything
is going.

475
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,440
We can see all the scripts
that got pulled down.

476
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,350
So if I go and click and say,
OK well, let's see what this

477
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,080
script looks like.

478
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,770
OK, lots of great
stuff in here.

479
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,130
The timeline to understand
what's going on &mdash;

480
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,000
again, all the stuff that you're
used to being able to

481
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,370
use and see within the Chrome
Developer Tools are all

482
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,730
available here for
you, right now.

483
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,590
So in particular, what I want to
go do is show you a couple

484
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,300
of things in here.

485
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:18,740
Because it behaves just like
it does on your desktop.

486
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,570
I can go in.

487
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:25,400
And sure enough, notice how
in the actual device, as I

488
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,950
highlight through different
portions, if I go and expand

489
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,260
my header, so there is
that hyperlink there.

490
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,660
I can go through.

491
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,530
And I want to actually go, and
let's find where the main

492
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,180
content is here.

493
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:47,340
So I think my main content is &mdash;
where are we going here &mdash;

494
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,590
content.

495
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,250

496
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:53,820
There we go.

497
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,900
I think that's our content.

498
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,730
OK, so div &mdash;

499
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,870
I'm going to expand this out.

500
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,490
And so there's that.

501
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,490
So now, we could start going
through and finding all of the

502
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,390
different pieces that we want.

503
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,440
And we can go through and
change these things.

504
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,980
So I'm having a hard
time finding this.

505
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,330
I always love going for these
kinds of things &mdash;

506
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,600
live sessions.

507
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,660
Let's go up to Nav, Unordered
List, expand this.

508
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:28,270
And instead of it saying Home,
let's say Pete was here.

509
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,720
And sure enough, if we go have
a look at our page &mdash;

510
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,150
well, we're replacing
those with images.

511
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,770
So of course it's not
going to show that

512
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,480
particular right now.

513
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,830
But let me try.

514
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,780
Let me see if I can get
a different one.

515
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,910
I'm pretty sure it won't work.

516
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,055
But Pete was here.

517
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:45,850
Yeah, there we go.

518
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,550
All right, so we've
got Pete was here.

519
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,420
So you can go through.

520
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,010
You can change all the things
that you'd expect to normally

521
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,960
be able to change, within the
Chrome Developer Tools.

522
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,870
Nice, easy way to be able to go
in, understand what's going

523
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,230
on, and build your website, your
web application, without

524
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,130
too many things.

525
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,670
You can apply styles.

526
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,680
Now, the one thing to keep in
mind, this is being served

527
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,220
from the developer tools
on the device.

528
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,590
So you are getting the Device
Developer Tools.

529
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,610
So currently, this is Chrome
that's available in the

530
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,160
marketplace.

531
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,050
It's Chrome 18.

532
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,210
So you're only going
to have the

533
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,800
standard Chrome 18 features.

534
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,500
So if I go down here and I bring
up my settings, I don't

535
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,640
have the ability to be able
to change my UA string.

536
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,170
Actually, yes I do have
the ability to

537
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,870
change my User Agent.

538
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,320
But I don't have the ability to
be able to go and change my

539
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,430
device metrics or anything
like that.

540
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,500
Now, obviously, it would be a
little weird change the device

541
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,380
metrics on something that's
already a little tiny, but one

542
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,000
of those things you may or may
not want to do at some point

543
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,880
in the future.

544
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,420
Certainly, setting geolocation
is something that's

545
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,150
interesting and that you might
want to be able to do.

546
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,590
So with that, let's
get out of here.

547
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,600
So that's the Chrome
remote debugging.

548
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,580
It give you easy access to be
able to go through and debug

549
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,670
Chrome, remotely.

550
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,880
Let's take a look at how
you'd do Safari, on iOS

551
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,670
6 and on the iPad.

552
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:21,280
So again, very similar, there's
an initial set of set

553
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,480
up that you're going to
need to go through.

554
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,570
And I'm going to just switch
out some devices here.

555
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,120
So that I can plug-in
an iPad in.

556
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,710
And we can get this connected.

557
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,350
Now, again, one of the key
things that you need to be

558
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,660
aware of is that it does that
same thing where it needs to

559
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,460
be connected directly
to your device.

560
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,290
So you need to plug-in
via USB.

561
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,470
And your device is connected.

562
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,550
So now, let me bring
up our device.

563
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,240
So we can see what's
going on here.

564
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,640
So here we go.

565
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,250
We've got we've got my device.

566
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,490
And the set up settings are
pretty much the same.

567
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,880
We need to go through, and in
Safari, on our iPad or on our

568
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,780
iPhone, we need to enable the
Advanced Settings, so that we

569
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,420
can go in and actually
see what's going on.

570
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,600
But we also need to, on our
computer, go and to turn those

571
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,630
things on as well.

572
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,460
So that we've got them
set up there as well.

573
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,380
So sure enough, I've got my
iPad up and working here.

574
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,040
So you can see that we've
got everything running.

575
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,840
And so now, very similarly,
we're going

576
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,790
to do the same thing.

577
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,170
So I'll start up Safari.

578
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,620
And we'll come out
of the slides &mdash;

579
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,540
and Safari.

580
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,820
Great, so Safari comes up just
as we would normally expect.

581
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,550
I'll make this full screen,
so that we can see

582
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,692
everything going on.

583
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:53,610
Here we go.

584
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,960
And what I'm going to do is
go to the Develop Menu.

585
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,900
And you'll notice that your
device shows up, in the

586
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,030
Develop Menu.

587
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,800
So I go and click Pete's iPad.

588
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,790
And it shows me all of the tabs
that are currently open.

589
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,780
So I can go and click
on HTML5 Rocks.

590
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,250
And sure enough,
there it goes.

591
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,880
We've got my page up,
open, and ready

592
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,690
for me to start debugging.

593
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,560
Now, these are the Safari
developer tools.

594
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,560

595
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,770
So if you're used to using
those, you've got the ability

596
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,520
to be able to do all of the
things that you'd expect to be

597
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,290
able to do.

598
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,500
And notice, as you start going
through these things, you get

599
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,310
that same experience.

600
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,470
So let me just bring this down,
so that we can see this

601
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,870
a little bit better.

602
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,580
And I'm going to zoom in just a
little bit more, so that we

603
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,800
can see this.

604
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,480
So again, same thing,
I'll open up the

605
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,040
header, open up my Nav.

606
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,580
And again, here's my
unordered list.

607
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,410
And Posts and Tutorials &mdash;

608
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,360
I'll change this.

609
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,520
Pete was here.

610
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,200
And sure enough, can
we see that there?

611
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,880
There you go.

612
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,200
So it says Pete was here.

613
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,500
So you've got that same set of
tools, same set of abilities,

614
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,660
to be able to go in and do
remote debugging as you'd

615
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,650
expect to be able to do.

616
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:24,260
So this is a really great way to
understand what's going on

617
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,590
with the experience.

618
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,460
How are things working?

619
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,420
Is something going a
little bit weird?

620
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,680
Is something maybe not acting
like it you'd expect it to?

621
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,540
Is it pulling down
different data?

622
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,160

623
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,190
On this device as well, you do
have the ability to be able to

624
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,660
get in and turn on the Network
Link Conditioner.

625
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,210
Let me see if I can find that
real quick and show you guys.

626
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:54,795
But it's under Settings and
under the Developer Tools.

627
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:57,110
I'll see if I can find
this here real quick.

628
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:09,560

629
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,950
Of course, I'm not going
to be able to find it.

630
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,090
Well, I didn't plan
on showing this.

631
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,720
I was thinking about it after
the fact and thought it might

632
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,970
be kind of cool to show.

633
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,300
But I don't see it.

634
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,570
So I won't show it today.

635
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,870
It is a way that you can be able
to go and set the things

636
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,120
that you want.

637
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,310

638
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,690
All right.

639
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,810
Well, you can trust me that
it is in here somewhere &mdash;

640
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,840
a quick, easy way to be able to
go in, set up the network

641
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,950
settings, and turn on the
particular things that you

642
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,400
might be looking to do.

643
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,140
So Firefox has the same set
up, or a similar set up.

644
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,860
One of the key differences on
the Firefox set up, that I

645
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,710
really appreciate in their
particular set up, is that you

646
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,790
don't necessarily need to
connect the device via USB.

647
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,620
You can actually do it
over the network.

648
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,990
So as long as both devices are
connected to the same network

649
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,490
and on the same subnet,
you can connect in.

650
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,910
Again, there's a bunch of set
up that you need to go to.

651
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,710
On the desktop, you're
going to need to

652
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,320
enable remote debugging.

653
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,570
And on the remote device
on your mobile &mdash;

654
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,740
either your phone, your tablet,

655
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,880
whatever you need to do &mdash;

656
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,880
you need to go and turn
on the debugger.

657
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,930
You need to turn on the local
debugger, set that to false,

658
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,470
so that it sends all
the connection out.

659
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,530
In fact, let's see if
we've got it set up.

660
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,530
Actually, I tried it
earlier today.

661
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,090
It didn't work.

662
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,540
I don't want to go
and try it again.

663
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,640
I think the reason it didn't
work is I just didn't have the

664
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,770
same subnet set up.

665
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,460
Or there's some kind of firewall
rules within our

666
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,210
subnet that prevents that
from happening.

667
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,690
Again, you can go check at the
link there, where you can see

668
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,050
how to get more instructions
on getting that set up.

669
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,540
But it's a pretty easy way to be
able to go through and see

670
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,020
how your experience
is going to work.

671
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,390
One of the other really
important ways that you can

672
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,290
test your devices and this is
something that is, I think,

673
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,280
super important.

674
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,990
And I really want to encourage
the community to go out and

675
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,910
participate and help with
these Open Device Labs.

676
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,730
But the concept behind an Open
Device Lab is to have a space

677
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,880
where anybody can come in, test
their web application on

678
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,460
the variety of devices
that are out there.

679
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,280
When you think about the cost
of maintaining multiple

680
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,550
devices between all the
different versions, the

681
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,910
different operating systems, the
different sized screens,

682
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:48,400
the different processors, all
of a sudden that becomes a

683
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,300
pretty complex and almost
nightmarish experience to do.

684
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,020
And so to be able to go through
and use something like

685
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,430
an open device lab where there's
just tons of devices

686
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,540
available, and not just the
latest and greatest devices,

687
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,640
but also older devices that have
been around for a little

688
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:12,010
while or devices that are newer
but have the original

689
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:15,090
version of their operating
system on them.

690
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,190
So having those open
device labs are a

691
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,700
really fantastic thing.

692
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,400
If you have spare devices you're
not using anymore,

693
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,310
donate them to your
local device lab.

694
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,120
Or if you're in an area where
there's not an open device

695
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,370
lab, start one.

696
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,540
Find some folks.

697
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,420
Find a location where you can
help start your own open

698
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,470
device labs.

699
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:42,620
There's a great blog post here
that talks about all of the

700
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:47,780
open device labs, as well as
where you can go to find them,

701
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,020
as well as how to
start your own.

702
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,540
There's a couple here.

703
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,120
There's one that's just
starting in Brooklyn.

704
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,520
We're trying to get one
started in Manhattan.

705
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,990
There's one in San Francisco,
I believe,

706
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,020
just getting started.

707
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,200
There's one in Oakland.

708
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,760
We need these all
over the place.

709
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,570
We need these are all around the
world, so that developers

710
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,760
have a place where they can go
and test their applications,

711
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,610
where you can go,
where I can go.

712
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,909
Because I don't have
every device.

713
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,079
And I'm sure you don't either.

714
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,090
And you probably don't
want to maintain all

715
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,179
those devices either &mdash;

716
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,230
crazy, crazy amounts of
work to go do that.

717
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,610
So with that, I've got a couple
of favors to ask before

718
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,739
I start taking some
of your questions.

719
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:38,900
I will just bring up slides so
that you can have a look.

720
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,090
If you've got questions, you
can post them there to that

721
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,270
Google short link.

722
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,179
And I'll take your questions
here in a minute.

723
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,610
But we need your help.

724
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,489
We can't accept the status
quo with web development.

725
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:55,440
It just simply doesn't
work anymore.

726
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,660
And we need developers to really
push the limits of

727
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,150
what's cool, of what's
available, and

728
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,210
just do cool stuff.

729
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,280
If you're building something,
don't accept

730
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,340
that, oh, it's mobile.

731
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,735
So it's kind of going
to be slower.

732
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,370
It's going to suck.

733
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,350
Don't accept that.

734
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,950
That's not a good answer.

735
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,000
Go build awesome for the web.

736
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,940
If you find bugs, if you find
things that don't work as you

737
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,950
expect them in Chrome for
Android, tell us about them.

738
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,310
We want to hear about them.

739
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,880
You can go File bugs
at new.mcrbug.com.

740
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,770

741
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,670
Also, go there.

742
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,980
Have a look to see what bugs
are already filed, and star

743
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,020
the things that you think
are important.

744
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,550
Do you think it's important that
there's an ability to be

745
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,800
able to hide the address bar?

746
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,830
There's a bug for that.

747
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,080
Go star that if you think
that's important.

748
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,220
Reliable viewport control,
there's a bug for that.

749
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,400
We've got lots of bugs
filed already.

750
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,570
And we want your help to make
sure that we're making Chrome

751
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,620
for Android the best browser
that it can be.

752
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,580
If you're building cool stuff,
tell us about it.

753
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,690
When we launched Chrome a number
of years ago, one of

754
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,060
the things that we did was
launch Chrome Experiments,

755
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,440
which was sort of this
playground for people showing

756
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,680
off the cool stuff that
they built on the web.

757
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,590
Well, when we launched Chrome
for Android back in June, we

758
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,160
wanted to say to developers,
show us the cool stuff you're

759
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,670
doing on the mobile web.

760
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,080
Show us cool.

761
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,110
And it's a great place where you
can show the rest of the

762
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,170
world all the cool stuff
that you're doing

763
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,370
with the mobile web.

764
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:28,190
So build some cool mobile
experiments that work great on

765
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,000
mobile devices, that take
advantage of the unique

766
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,670
capabilities of a mobile
device &mdash; maybe touch, maybe

767
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,580
device orientation, maybe
multi-touch &mdash;

768
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:41,500
but works beautifully on that
small screen and just is an

769
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,080
awesome experience.

770
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,150
Show us those things.

771
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,350
Show off your skills.

772
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,580
Show it off to your friends.

773
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,960
Do neat stuff.

774
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,600
Start an open device lab in
your area, if you haven't

775
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,290
started one.

776
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,130
Or you haven't seen
one in your area.

777
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,360
Or you think it's important.

778
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,950
Go do it.

779
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,050
We'd love to have
more of these.

780
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:05,080
It's really important to get
these out, to get access to

781
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,060
these devices.

782
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,330
So that we can build more cool
stuff and make sure it works

783
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,170
on the plethora of devices
that are out there.

784
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,040
But really, the mobile web is
what you and I make it.

785
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,860
We have an opportunity to
build absolutely cool.

786
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,970
We have the ability to
do amazing stuff.

787
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,765
And it's up to as web developers
to go do it.

788
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:29,630
So don't accept the
status quo.

789
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,920
Go build cool.

790
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,320
So with that, I'll open it
up to your questions.

791
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,650
I've seen already one question
in our moderator, as well as a

792
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,810
bunch of other places.

793
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,810
These slides are available
if you want.

794
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,260
Let me get rid of this guy here
for a sec so that you can

795
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,050
see the slides.

796
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,070
But the slides are available.

797
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,440
It's always kind of
fun to do this.

798
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,480
I do this a little backward.

799
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,580
See the slide link
is right there.

800
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,150
Yes, so the slide link
is right there.

801
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,410
You can go check out these
slides yourself, as well you

802
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,230
can watch last week's session,
where we talked about some of

803
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,830
the libraries and other stuff
that is important for mobile

804
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,100
web developers.

805
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,690
I'm going to be back in the new
year, doing more stuff for

806
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,600
mobile, talking about High DPI,
multi-touch, all sorts of

807
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,840
stuff that really is relevant
to the mobile web developer.

808
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,910
If you're building for the
mobile web, you want to tune

809
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,940
into these sessions.

810
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,670
We'll try and do them at least
monthly, if not more.

811
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,900
Because there's a lot of really
great stuff out there.

812
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,870
So with that, I'll take
your questions.

813
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,860
Pop this guy up, and let's
just go to me.

814
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,170
So you get a nice, big
picture of me.

815
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:44,710
So one of the first questions
that I've got &mdash;

816
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,370
during my session last week,
I'm just reading it off the

817
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,210
screen here.

818
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,400
"During session one, you
mentioned to avoid relative

819
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,800
and absolute positioning.

820
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,100
Why?

821
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,080
Can you explain a little
bit about that?"

822
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,710
Yeah, absolutely.

823
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,060
Relative and absolute
positioning on a mobile device

824
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,690
can be used.

825
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,330
But you need to use
them with caution.

826
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:06,620
Because when you start thinking
about, I want to move

827
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:15,960
this div, for example, over 600
pixels, on a mobile device

828
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,030
that's maybe only
320 pixels wide.

829
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,620
You're going to move
it off screen.

830
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,260
So as you think about using
absolute and relative

831
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,430
positioning, you need to be very
careful that you're not

832
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:32,910
using pixels, but instead of
using either percents or &mdash;

833
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,910
there's a new unit that
you can use &mdash;

834
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,490
I don't think it's landed
everywhere.

835
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,600
I think it's only landed
in a couple of places.

836
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,050
But Viewport width &mdash;

837
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,180
so you can actually say, 1% of
the Viewport width, I want to

838
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,200
move it over.

839
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,800
So you can move a
div or element

840
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,720
over a specific amount.

841
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,860
So as you think about using
absolute and relative

842
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:03,710
positioning, just think in
terms of the size of the

843
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,340
screen that you're working on.

844
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,620
So I guess I should have
been a little bit

845
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,500
more clear last week.

846
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,730
It's really about being careful
and not moving stuff

847
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,120
over that will show
up off screen.

848
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,280
Because it may just show up in
the wrong place, may not even

849
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,160
show up on the device anymore.

850
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,320
So the next question
that we've got is &mdash;

851
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,780
what's going on with Chrome
for Android for &mdash;

852
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,440
"What's going on for
Chrome for Android?

853
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,850
Are we going to see another
release this year?

854
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,210
Are we going to get more
developer tools, like some of

855
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,810
the stuff you showed
us earlier?"

856
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,870
So that's a great question.

857
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:46,070
The end team is working on
trying to get sort of feature

858
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,120
parity between the mobile and
desktop version, get us to the

859
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,050
same version.

860
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,860
On desktop right now, I think
we're running 24 or 25.

861
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,690
On mobile, we're only at 18.

862
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,570
When they started working
on Chrome for Android.

863
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:05,050
They had to do a fork to the
code, to be able to make some

864
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,090
changes and all that.

865
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,480
They're almost done, if they
haven't already finished

866
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,340
integrating all those
changes back to the

867
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,080
main Chromium tree.

868
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,430
Now that's done, they're going
to be able to go through.

869
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,020
And we'll be able to see,
hopefully, more frequent

870
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,120
releases soon.

871
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,850
I don't have a date for you on
when we're going to see the

872
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,470
next release.

873
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,310
I've got my fingers crossed
that we're going to see it

874
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,860
really soon.

875
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,470
But I'm not going to hold my
breath on the specific date or

876
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,090
tell you a specific
date because I'm

877
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,590
not really 100% sure.

878
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,930
We want to make sure
we get this right.

879
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,810
We want to make sure that we're
giving you the right set

880
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:44,720
of tools and the right set of
resources that you need.

881
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,410
So that looks like that's the
end of the questions.

882
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,450
I want to say thank you guys
so much for joining us, or

883
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,550
joining me.

884
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,740
It was a great session,
I think, today.

885
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,220
I hope you learned a lot.

886
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,000
Be sure to check out session
number one, so that you see

887
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,290
some of the stuff
that's going on.

888
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,170
My name's Pete LePage and
thanks for joining me.

889
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,640
I hope you have a really
great holiday.

890
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,350
And we'll see you next year.

891
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:21,433
