1
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:02,234
Green: Hi.
Welcome.

2
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:03,434
I'm Brad Green.

3
00:00:03,434 --> 00:00:05,267
I'm the manager
of Accessibility Engineering

4
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,801
at Google and...

5
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:08,267
Rosenthal:
And I'm Erin Rosenthal,

6
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:09,701
the Product Manager
for Accessibility.

7
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:10,901
Green: Fantastic.

8
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:12,567
So we're gonna talk
a little bit about

9
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,767
what accessibility means
in products

10
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,367
and how we can use features
that are built in

11
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,601
to the platforms
that Google offers.

12
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,133
Erin, can you go
to the next slide?

13
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,934
Okay. So just a couple
of questions.

14
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:24,367
How many of you
have some experience

15
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:27,634
with accessibility technology
already?

16
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,567
Okay. A little more than half.
That's fantastic.

17
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:31,868
How many of you are actually
responsible for building

18
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:34,601
accessibility
into your products?

19
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,267
A couple of us.
Okay, keep your hands up.

20
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,734
How many of you know the
current gaps in your products

21
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:41,167
and know how to fix them?

22
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,634
Okay. Fair number. Okay.

23
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:45,634
So that's what we're here
to talk about.

24
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:48,501
We're gonna, first of all,
talk a little bit about

25
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,968
some &mdash;
what users expect

26
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,801
or are looking for
in accessible products.

27
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,734
And I'll just make a point

28
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:56,968
that we're gonna go into
some particular use cases

29
00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:59,601
but the range of accessibility
is wide.

30
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,534
There are a lot of
different use cases,

31
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:04,734
ways that we'd like to make
our applications accessible.

32
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,934
What we're gonna talk about
forms a framework

33
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,300
for many different modes
of accessibility, um,

34
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,367
that users can take advantage of
in your apps.

35
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:15,834
We're gonna talk about
how you build accessibility

36
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:19,634
specifically in our products
Chrome and Android.

37
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:22,601
And then we're gonna show you
what tools we have

38
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:25,901
to both build and test
these applications.

39
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,033
We're gonna follow with
some cool demos.

40
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:31,300
We're gonna show you what we
think are inspirational

41
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,000
applications that show off

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,801
some of the best features
in accessibility.

43
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:38,000
Rosenthal: So you're
probably asking yourself &mdash;

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,434
granted, most of you
seem to know

45
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,901
a lot about accessibility
already &mdash;

46
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,567
but a lot of people ask,
"Why should I care?

47
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,868
Why should I make
my product accessible?"

48
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:46,300
Well, there's a number
of reasons.

49
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,467
Number one is actually
it makes financial sense

50
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,868
for your company.

51
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:52,701
The government and education
tend to have requirements

52
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:55,601
for accessibility in the
products that they purchase,

53
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,300
and they're very large
contracts,

54
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,367
very large groups that you can
sell your products into.

55
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,934
So it's really important
to make sure

56
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,334
that your products
are accessible

57
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,033
so that you can compete
in that marketplace

58
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:08,300
and get them as large-paying
customers, right?

59
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,033
The main reason
that government and education

60
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,767
want products
to be accessible

61
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:15,968
are so that students
can continue to learn

62
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:18,167
and learn alongside
sighted students

63
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,968
and hearing students
in school

64
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:24,467
and so that as people grow
and move into the workplace

65
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:26,534
that they can continue to work
alongside their peers

66
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:28,667
in companies like ours,
right?

67
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,534
Also, I know for me,

68
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,767
it always helps me
when I work on something

69
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,033
that enables people
to do something

70
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,667
they weren't able
to do before.

71
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,167
That feels great,

72
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,434
and I like working on
accessibility because of that,

73
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,701
that it's really--it's a good
feel-good thing, right?

74
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:46,000
You know, so you can see that
people weren't able to do this,

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,033
and now they can.

76
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,467
Wonderful.

77
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:51,801
Also, there's a lot of
additional technology benefit

78
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:53,267
to making your products
accessible.

79
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:56,834
A lot of underlying technologies
that you put into your products

80
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,968
will benefit you
in other ways.

81
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:01,734
So for example,
with Android,

82
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:03,701
when we were making it
accessible,

83
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,901
we added a text to speech
engine.

84
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:07,834
Well, later that came in handy

85
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,534
as a way to do
driving directions

86
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:11,033
in the maps application.

87
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,501
We already had
the text engine there,

88
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:13,801
so it could just
rely on it there.

89
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:15,434
Green: That's right, Erin.
As a matter of fact,

90
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:17,434
there's a lot of other places
where accessibility

91
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,300
is kind of like a moon mission.

92
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,534
The technologies we develop

93
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,501
that are for helping people
access the platform

94
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,167
are usable to everybody.

95
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,234
Matter of fact,
they help all of your users.

96
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,000
For example,
in keyboard access,

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,601
we as developers, we rely
heavily on keyboard shortcuts.

98
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:36,400
Adding keyboard access
to your applications

99
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,133
may be the number one thing
for web apps

100
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,133
that you can do
to make it more accessible.

101
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,167
Not just for folks who might
not be able to use a mouse,

102
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,367
but for everybody.

103
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,467
Like I want a hot key

104
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:47,634
for almost every one
of the special &mdash;

105
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:50,968
every one of the use cases
that I have in an application.

106
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:54,234
There are some technologies
like text to speech

107
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,634
and speech recognition
that were once thought of

108
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:59,601
as exotic interface elements &mdash;

109
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:00,868
are now becoming commonplace.

110
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,400
You notice on Android

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,300
I can add a speech
recognition element, um...

112
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,534
to take input.

113
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:10,767
Also on many devices,

114
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,100
we have the ability
to give vibrational feedback,

115
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,334
what we call haptics.

116
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:15,968
And video game developers
found out

117
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:17,367
if they made
the controller vibrate

118
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,667
when different events happen
in the UI,

119
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,868
it becomes a much more
real experience.

120
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,467
The same is true
for my applications

121
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:28,367
when I can give some input
to the user that's not &mdash;

122
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,100
doesn't need to be overt.

123
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,834
I can make the device vibrate

124
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:34,367
and make it seem like
a real part of my world.

125
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,934
When I caption video streams,

126
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:39,734
it not only opens up the video

127
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,701
to folks who can't hear,

128
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,868
it allows me to do
really interesting things &mdash;

129
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,801
like you can run the captions

130
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,767
through a service
like Google Translate,

131
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,634
and all of a sudden,
all of the people

132
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,400
who aren't native speakers

133
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,167
can now access
the video content.

134
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:58,133
Customizable UIs,
as one example &mdash;

135
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,434
in Gmail, I can set my theme

136
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,901
and be able to set...

137
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:07,267
theme elements, backgrounds,
contrast, colors

138
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:10,067
might be kind of a nice thing,
personalization &mdash;

139
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,033
adding bling
to my environment &mdash;

140
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:15,734
might be actually
also required for some folks

141
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,701
who need different contrast,
different colors,

142
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,868
different magnification
in my application.

143
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:22,601
Testability, finally.

144
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,267
Turns out that if I'm building
an automated test,

145
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:28,467
it has a lot of the same needs
that, say, a blind user needs.

146
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,467
Like my automated test
can't use the mouse

147
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:33,067
and usually
can't read the screen,

148
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,067
and so these
accessibility features

149
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:40,567
form a very stable API
for me to build

150
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,434
automated tests against.

151
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:43,834
Let's go next.

152
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,133
Rosenthal: So let's talk
a little bit about the users,

153
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,968
people who use
accessible technology.

154
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:51,100
It's really important
for you to understand them

155
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,000
and how they interact
with your products,

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
just like all your other
users, right?

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,534
So the main thing
to keep in mind

158
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,701
are the input and output
technologies that they use

159
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:02,367
and making sure that you have
multiple redundant ways

160
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,067
of interacting
with your applications &mdash;

161
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,234
basically not relying
on a mouse,

162
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,734
not relying on rollovers

163
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,033
to be able to get
to your content.

164
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,133
So main ones to keep in mind

165
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:14,200
are for input using
keyboard and voice and touch,

166
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,100
and then some special
purpose displays

167
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,400
like this Braille display
that we have pictured here

168
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,033
where you can do corded input.

169
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,634
And then also for feedback &mdash;

170
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:23,400
feedback's really vital
so that your user knows

171
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,734
where they are on the screen

172
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:26,000
and what
they're interacting with

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,868
at all points in time, right?

174
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:29,467
So you should
make sure to have, again,

175
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,868
redundant feedback as well.

176
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:33,567
So not only have speech
but other audio cues

177
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:38,100
for when tasks complete or other
notifications are happening,

178
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,767
and also vibration feedback,

179
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,434
so that you get
that sense of reality

180
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,000
when you're using the product.

181
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,934
Plus, keep in mind other things
like the Braille display

182
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,634
that we have here
as another input &mdash;

183
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:50,267
or output device,
in this case.

184
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,634
Green: Okay. So we've got
a list of a couple things,

185
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:54,000
some sort of rules of thumb

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,334
for making accessible
applications...

187
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,834
how to think about
what sort of features

188
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,601
I need to pay attention to
as a developer.

189
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,367
First of all,
I kind of mentioned this.

190
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:04,067
Make sure
that all of my use cases

191
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:07,367
can actually be completed
without using a pointing device.

192
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,000
How do I do this?

193
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,901
Well, I unplug my mouse,

194
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,467
and I try and use
the application.

195
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:15,133
Usually, this means
that I'll have implemented

196
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,434
keyboard shortcuts
that I make sure that the &mdash;

197
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:19,968
if it's a web app,
that the tab order makes sense

198
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:21,634
and that I can actually
focus on

199
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,834
every element on the screen.

200
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:27,901
I also want to make sure
that I am managing focus well

201
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,234
inside my application.

202
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:31,968
For example,
if I'm using HTML

203
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,567
to simulate a modal dialog,

204
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,033
I wanna make sure that
I'm actually trapping events

205
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,567
so that if the user's trying
to tab through the elements

206
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:42,634
that they can't actually
reach the elements

207
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:47,133
that are behind my, uh,
my floating dialog box.

208
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,167
If you want more information
on this,

209
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,267
we've got a session tomorrow
which does a deep dive

210
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:54,100
on building accessible
HTML applications.

211
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,000
Depending on whether I'm on
Android or on the web,

212
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,434
there are several
declarative ways

213
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:03,834
that I can tell
assistive technologies

214
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,868
how to interact
with my application &mdash;

215
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,634
in the markup in the XML
for my Android application

216
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:11,634
or in the HTML
for my web-based application.

217
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:13,167
We'll go into a little bit
of this,

218
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,467
uh, and we have talks here
at I/O that go

219
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:19,367
much more into depth
on both of these.

220
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,701
And then lastly,
for me as a developer,

221
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,300
if I'm building
custom controls &mdash;

222
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,968
things that aren't part
of the standard widget set &mdash;

223
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:30,400
either on Android
or if I'm, you know,

224
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,234
putting a bunch of DIVs together
to look like

225
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:35,968
some kind of crazy new control
in HTML,

226
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:38,200
I'm gonna have to do a little
bit of extra work

227
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,400
to add accessibility
support there.

228
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,634
And finally,
uh, I just need to test it.

229
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:45,133
Um, it's--it's &mdash;

230
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,868
Uh, it's certainly disappointing
if I make &mdash;

231
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,534
put a lot of &mdash;
put some work into

232
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:52,000
making my application
to be accessible

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,234
and then find out that
maybe my login screen

234
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,334
is not accessible.

235
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,567
So I want to make sure
that I test

236
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:59,801
all the flows with the &mdash;
uh, assistive technologies

237
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:03,133
that I'm targeting.

238
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,868
Rosenthal: So what we're really
talking about here

239
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,467
are creating these
empowering products

240
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:07,868
that enable independence.

241
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:10,100
These are products that work
out of the box,

242
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,400
are easy to use,
that someone can set up

243
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,634
on their self &mdash;
by themselves,

244
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,200
and that are really easy
to learn and, um,

245
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,868
provide that good feedback
so that they

246
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:20,868
can get familiar
with the environment.

247
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,934
Um, this is such
a liberating feeling,

248
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,467
being able to do this
all on your own,

249
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,000
and it's really the right
thing to do.

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,200
Um, also, as Brad said,
keep in mind

251
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,701
to test your entire product
and not just think of,

252
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,634
like, the main part
of your interface,

253
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,834
but that from login
through documentation

254
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,000
and even your help center,
that all of that

255
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,300
is also accessible.

256
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,067
Green: Okay, I want to take
a little bit of a closer look

257
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:47,334
at building web applications
and what makes those accessible.

258
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,667
So if we get
in the way-back machine

259
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,901
and think back to the '90s
when the web was simple,

260
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:55,634
uh, how many of you
used Mosaic?

261
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,434
Oh, a bunch of us are old.

262
00:09:57,434 --> 00:09:58,567
Okay, good.

263
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:02,667
Um, accessibility
back then, uh,

264
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,267
was a simple problem.

265
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:05,868
Um, usually app &mdash;
uh, you know,

266
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:07,067
web pages looked like this.

267
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,434
It was a bunch of text
and links

268
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:09,901
and maybe some images.

269
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,801
And accessibility meant adding
alt tags to images.

270
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,501
Matter of fact,
lot of us used alt tags

271
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,367
when my modem was too slow.

272
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,267
I'd turn images off and I'd just
read what the alt tags said.

273
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:21,934
But the world has changed.

274
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:24,133
Now even our most
simple applications

275
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,801
like Google Search have become
very rich and interactive,

276
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:29,567
so that as I'm typing,
Google Search updates

277
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,667
my complete set
of search results.

278
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,033
So we need to think differently
about how we're providing

279
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,767
accessibility
to these interactive,

280
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,267
dynamically-updating
applications.

281
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:40,300
They've gotten even more complex
and interesting

282
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,934
with apps like Google Gmail
and Google Calendar.

283
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,501
Uh, and, uh, like,
you name it.

284
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,868
There's so many apps out there
who are &mdash;

285
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:49,634
who have even richer interfaces.

286
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:52,300
So, as I mentioned,
one of the first things

287
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,300
we want to do is make sure
that I can access

288
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,033
all of the workflows in my
application via the keyboard.

289
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,701
Gmail, for example,
has a great set

290
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,567
of keyboard shortcuts
that give me access

291
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,434
to some of the most
common actions.

292
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:08,634
Uh, some of the other actions
I'll need to be able

293
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,234
to complete via other
keyboard focusing,

294
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:12,801
uh, by tabbing through
the application

295
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:16,000
and activating
through the keyboard.

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,200
I also talked a little bit
about that there

297
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,067
is specific markup that
I can add to my HTML page.

298
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,901
In, uh &mdash;
In the web,

299
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,467
there is a standard
called ARIA.

300
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:29,667
And ARIA gives me the ability
to tell assistive technologies

301
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,534
like screen readers
and Braille devices

302
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,501
how to interact with my UI.

303
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:36,200
So in my toolbar example
I have here,

304
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,033
I've, uh, marked it up
so that my images,

305
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,567
which are what a, uh &mdash;
someone who's using the mouse

306
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,634
would interact with &mdash;
so that if I'm using

307
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:47,601
a screen reader,
I can know that that "b"

308
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:50,234
up there is not
just an image,

309
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:52,234
but it should be interacted
with as a button,

310
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:53,601
so that a screen reader
can announce

311
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:54,767
that this is a button.

312
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:55,868
Matter of fact,
it has a label

313
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:57,834
that's specified
by my alt text there

314
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:03,734
that this will turn the text
that I have selected bold.

315
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:05,200
All right.

316
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,400
So, specifically,
what is Google doing to help?

317
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,133
Uh, I have a couple
announcements today.

318
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,467
I'm very excited to talk
about three things.

319
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,200
First, in Chrome, uh,

320
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,300
yesterday, we just blogged
that we are adding support

321
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,267
for some of the major
screen readers on Windows

322
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:26,534
with JAWS and NVDA on Mac
with voiceover

323
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:30,601
and, uh, uh,
and several others.

324
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:33,701
On ChromeOS,
you can't actually install

325
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,834
other software except
via extensions.

326
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,467
And so we're making available

327
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,667
a screen reader we call
ChromeVox.

328
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:45,200
And we're making it available
to you developers early

329
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,100
through a download,
so you cannot only use it

330
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,767
via ChromeOS,
but you can actually install it

331
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,801
in any version of Chrome
and use it on Windows

332
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:56,000
or Mac or Linux so that you
can see what it's like

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,601
to interact with your
application

334
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,400
using a screen reader.

335
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,601
We'll take a look at this
a little bit closer

336
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:02,968
later with a demo.

337
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,501
And then lastly,
uh,

338
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,501
we know a lot of you
photon-dependent users &mdash;

339
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,133
'cause you use the screen &mdash;

340
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:11,200
uh, like to see
what things look like.

341
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,167
So we've built an application
called ChromeShades.

342
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,701
And what ChromeShades does
is it shows you

343
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:19,501
what your application looks like
to a screen reader

344
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:21,334
and it allows you
to explore your application

345
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,801
visually but in the
sort of linear fashion

346
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:26,667
that a screen reader would
interact with your application.

347
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,033
We'll take a little
look at that,

348
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,133
and if you want a deeper dive,
please come see us

349
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:33,367
in the developer sandbox.

350
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,934
Okay, so, uh,
what does ChromeVox do for me?

351
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:38,367
Um, for those of you
who aren't familiar

352
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,334
with a screen reader, it does
a lot of the same things.

353
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,667
Uh, provides foken &mdash;
spoken feedback

354
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,667
as I navigate
through the application.

355
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,234
It uses ARIA,
which we just looked at,

356
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:50,567
and other accessibility
standards.

357
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:53,934
And it helps me work with
dynamic web applications

358
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,701
that we're now seeing,
uh,

359
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,133
by giving me,
uh, dynamic updates.

360
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:02,000
It tells me when things change
on the web page.

361
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,501
So there are some cases where
I want information spoken to me

362
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,834
and there are some cases
where I don't want,

363
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,467
uh, kind of the intrusive voice
to come up,

364
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,234
but I want maybe just some
audio indicator.

365
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:15,000
We call these things
"earcons."

366
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,934
Uh, little sounds
that tell me

367
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,267
when something has happened.

368
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,234
For example, when a
web page has finished loading

369
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,767
and is ready for me
to interact with it,

370
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:25,200
we'll play a sound rather than
announcing it with speech.

371
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,334
One thing we're doing
differently with ChromeVox,

372
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,601
uh, than we're doing
other places &mdash;

373
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:30,901
So we looked at ARIA.

374
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,667
ARIA is a declarative way
for me to specify

375
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,701
how screen readers can interact
with my app.

376
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:37,133
Now, declarative is great.

377
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:38,267
It's very easy.

378
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:40,067
It's very, uh &mdash;
It's not prone to bugs.

379
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,467
But it doesn't always work
for all cases

380
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:43,968
in a dynamic application.

381
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,167
So we're giving you
the developer

382
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,434
a, uh, imperative way
to tell it what to do

383
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:50,968
through something we call
VoxScript.

384
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:53,667
VoxScripts are, uh,
just JavaScript

385
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,968
written against
a very simple API

386
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:59,534
that lets you tell the
screen reader what to do.

387
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's take a look
at what it lets us do.

388
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,434
Couple simple things.

389
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:06,267
Uh, number one, I can
position the screen reader &mdash;

390
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,934
I can tell it,
"Start reading from this point."

391
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:10,133
So for example,
if I've got a &mdash;

392
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:12,200
like, a toolbar
that goes across the top

393
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,033
that isn't something that
I always want to interact with,

394
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,634
maybe I'll start
the user reading

395
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:19,100
below the toolbar.

396
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,467
I can position it
by passing it the DOMNode

397
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,434
that I want it
to start speaking from.

398
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,734
I can also just have
it speak some text

399
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,133
by calling the speak command.

400
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,467
And then lastly,
we can have it play

401
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:31,767
one of our earcon audio
indicators.

402
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,234
So a couple fun things
to play with.

403
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:35,534
So VoxScript bridges
some of the gaps

404
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,300
we have in our
declarative ARIA

405
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,934
and gives us ways to &mdash;

406
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:43,868
to have more direct control.

407
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:46,467
All right, so I'm gonna
invite Charles Chen

408
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:48,634
up to the stage,
and he's gonna give us a demo

409
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:50,100
of ChromeVox right now.

410
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,434
We'll get to see
what it looks like.

411
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:53,000
Rosenthal: Switching over.

412
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,167
Green: Oh, okay,
actually,

413
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,400
while Charles
is setting that up,

414
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,734
I might &mdash;
Does anyone have a question

415
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:57,901
I can answer right now?

416
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:02,667
Please come to the mic.

417
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,734
man: ChromeVox looks
very interesting.

418
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,400
I was wondering if,
uh, any &mdash;

419
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,767
if, uh, the GWT team has
actually taken a look at this

420
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:14,200
so that we may be able
to work with that

421
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,000
with widgets that we build
in GWT?

422
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,767
Green: That's a great question.

423
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:22,467
Now, so the UI that you saw
we have is, uh &mdash;

424
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:24,734
The API is via JavaScript.

425
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,067
You can of course call any
of those from JavaScript.

426
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,434
But it's an interesting
question.

427
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:29,801
Like, what could
we automatically

428
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:31,601
enable from GWT?

429
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,334
But come talk to us later.

430
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,534
Let's discuss further.

431
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:37,267
Okay, one more question maybe
and then we'll go to Charles.

432
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:38,534
man: I'm from the GWT team.

433
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:40,601
Green: Oh, great.

434
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:44,033
man: And, uh, we don't have
anything in progress on that,

435
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,367
but we'd love to talk
to you about it.

436
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:46,601
Green: Fantastic.
Okay, good.

437
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:48,367
Hey, maybe the three of us
could get together.

438
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,601
All right, let's switch
to Charles,

439
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:52,467
who's gonna give us
a demo of ChromeVox.

440
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:53,767
Chen: Thank you, Brad.

441
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,300
So, uh, if we can switch &mdash;
All right, cool.

442
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,701
We've switched.

443
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:58,701
So, uh, Erin earlier
was talking about

444
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:02,567
how important it is to have
out of the box accessibility.

445
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,667
And we have this with ChromeVox
on ChromeOS.

446
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,701
So right now you see
the login screen.

447
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,200
If I press "control, alt, Z,"

448
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
I can enable ChromeVox.

449
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,167
computer: Accessibility
turned off.

450
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,934
Chen: It said "turned off"
because it was on before.

451
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,934
So let me go re-enable it
right now.

452
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,767
computer: Accessibility
turned on.

453
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:21,167
Chen: Okay, so now accessibility
is turned on.

454
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,400
I can start using it.

455
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,434
I'm gonna log into my account
and then

456
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm gonna show you just how easy
it is to do a Google search.

457
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,167
computer: A-a-a-a-a-a-ast &mdash;
asterisk.

458
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,300
Chen: And notice it's saying
"asterisk."

459
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,868
It's not blurting out my
password, so.

460
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,634
computer: Signing in.

461
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,767
Chen: Tells me "signing in."

462
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,067
Okay.
[electronic tone]

463
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,501
computer: New tab.

464
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,501
Chen: Now you heard it
make that noise

465
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:46,067
and it said, "new tab."

466
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,534
So that noise is an earcon.

467
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,300
It's telling me that
the page is loaded,

468
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,000
it's ready for me
to interact with it,

469
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,534
and it told me the title.

470
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:53,934
In this case, it's "new tab."

471
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,033
So let me just do a search.

472
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,367
So, uh, now this is ChromeOS.

473
00:17:58,367 --> 00:17:59,767
It's just like Chrome
the browser,

474
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,434
so if you go
into the URL bar,

475
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,200
you can type a query and it will
just do a search right there.

476
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,434
So let me do that.

477
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:06,801
I'm gonna press "control, L"
to jump

478
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:09,567
right into the URL bar,
and I'm just gonna type,

479
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,167
and let's see what happens.

480
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,701
computer: Location, text box.

481
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:16,534
We--a &mdash;
Unselected.

482
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:17,734
[electronic tone]

483
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:21,200
www.weather, Google search.

484
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,467
Chen: Okay, so it did
a Google search for weather.

485
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,934
Now this is Google Instant
search.

486
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:27,434
So Instant search,
by default,

487
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:30,868
draws a little arrow next
to the current result

488
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:33,000
that the user is looking at,
and the user

489
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,634
can use the arrow keys
up and down

490
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:36,300
to move through
the search results.

491
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,601
So we looked at that
and we said,

492
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,734
"This is a wonderful
keyboard-driven interface."

493
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,567
Like Brad was talking about

494
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,634
having good keyboard
accessibility.

495
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:45,901
And so can we take advantage
of that

496
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,934
and leverage it and
use some VoxScript to make it

497
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,801
work even better
and make it just speak

498
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:52,100
what the user's currently
interested in?

499
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,834
So rather than having
something complex

500
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,033
where the user
has to look at the title,

501
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,801
look at a snippet,
and then go back to the title

502
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,000
to activate something,
could we make it

503
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,367
as simple as just pressing
"down arrow,"

504
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,501
hearing it, and then just
pressing "enter"

505
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,801
to go to the page?

506
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,300
So here's the results.

507
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,734
I'm going to press "down arrow"
and "up arrow" a couple times

508
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:11,868
to show how it works.

509
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:13,100
computer: Weather current
conditions and forecast

510
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,100
for the San Francisco Bay.

511
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,133
May--National and local
weather forecast.

512
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,300
Hurricane, radar and &mdash;

513
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,133
San Francisco weather forecast
and conditions.

514
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,033
May 10--National
and local weath &mdash;

515
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,501
Weather current conditions
and foreca &mdash;

516
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,567
Weather for San Francisco.

517
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,167
C, 62 degrees Fahrenheit,
vertical bar, degree, Celsius,

518
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:31,934
Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri,
sunny, partially clou &mdash;

519
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,267
Chen: Okay.

520
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:34,634
And also very important
right there,

521
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:36,767
I pressed "control"
to make it stop speaking.

522
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,567
So, you know,
speech is silver,

523
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,667
silence is golden, right?

524
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:43,267
So, um, as you can see,
it's very easy

525
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:46,000
to do a Google search,
very easy to get your results.

526
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,234
You'll also notice
that the text got larger.

527
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,167
That's because we applied
the CSS style sheet.

528
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:53,234
So for low-vision users,
you get not just the audio,

529
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,501
but you also get the visual
of it getting larger.

530
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,267
And so with that,
you know,

531
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:01,701
that's a really intro &mdash;
good intro to how we can

532
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,901
do something that's complex
with Google search.

533
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:06,734
But let's look at something
that's even more complex.

534
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,300
Let's look at Gmail,
right?

535
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,000
So Gmail tries to replicate

536
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,934
a desktop email client
experience

537
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:13,734
in the browser on the web

538
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,901
with just HTML and JavaScript.

539
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:17,767
So how can we make that
accessible?

540
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:18,901
Can we make that fast?

541
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,100
Can we make that efficient?
Right?

542
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,300
And the answer is yes.
Yes, we can.

543
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,467
So, um, again,
we're going to see how

544
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:28,300
we take advantage of existing
keyboard shortcuts

545
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,701
and we make things just work.

546
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:31,167
So let me load up my Gmail here.

547
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,601
[electronic tone]

548
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:35,834
computer: W-w-g-m-a-i-l.
Mail.

549
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,868
C-o-m.
Degrees Celsius.

550
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,100
[electronic tone]

551
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,567
Chen: Okay, so it's loading.

552
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:45,701
[electronic tones]
Okay.

553
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:48,267
computer: Mail inbox.
309.

554
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:53,033
C-l-c-i-s-l-3-3-g at mail.com.

555
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:55,334
Chen: So as you can see,
it told me the title

556
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,567
and it told me
how many messages I had.

557
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:00,601
And so with Gmail,
if you have keyboard shortcuts,

558
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:02,634
you can just use the "j" and "k"
keys to move

559
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:05,434
through the different threads
of emails.

560
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,567
You can press "enter"
to open an email.

561
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,467
And after you've opened
an email thread,

562
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:10,868
you can press any key...
computer: Not selected.

563
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:12,501
Chen: To go through the, uh &mdash;

564
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,734
to go through the messages
inside the thread.

565
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:17,434
So I'm gonna go ahead
and do that right now.

566
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:18,801
computer: Unread.

567
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,901
Thomas, left square, bracket,
right square, bracket,

568
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,200
Windows registry installation.

569
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,033
Unread.
Through left square &mdash;

570
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,200
Unread.
Left square, brack &mdash;

571
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,334
Unread.
Has a blue line.

572
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,767
Chen: Okay, so I'm gonna
go ahead and open this thread.

573
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,067
I'm gonna press "enter."

574
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,534
[electronic tone]
computer: Not selected.

575
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:36,601
Chen: Okay, so now it's telling
me nothing is selected.

576
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:41,267
I can go ahead and read through
the messages with "N" and "P."

577
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,067
[computer speaking rapidly]

578
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,133
computer: Show details.

579
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,434
Monday, May 9, 2011,
at 10:52 P.M.

580
00:21:46,434 --> 00:21:48,100
I am developing
an Android application

581
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,667
for encryption decryption
of messages.

582
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,400
I need some hash algorithm
to generate &mdash;

583
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,701
[computer speaking rapidly]

584
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:56,801
Show details.

585
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:59,000
Monday, May 9.

586
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,801
[computer speaking rapidly]

587
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:01,868
Show details.

588
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:04,901
Monday, May 9, 2011,
at 11:59 P.M.

589
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:08,634
developer.android.com/reference/

590
00:22:08,634 --> 00:22:11,067
java/security/spec/mgf &mdash;

591
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,100
Chen: Okay, so that &mdash;
[Rosenthal laughs]

592
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,033
See, now that was actually
a very interesting URL.

593
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,934
So I wanted to explore
that more

594
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:20,400
and as, um, as Brad and Erin
mentioned earlier,

595
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,667
with VoxScript you can
sync the screen reader

596
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,200
to your current position.

597
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,634
So now I'm on this message.

598
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:27,300
Let's say I wanted
to read that in more detail,

599
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,901
because that was just way
too fast, right?

600
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:32,767
So I can use the standard
ChromeVox commands

601
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,100
to read through.

602
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,767
So on ChromeOS,
this is "search" and "shift."

603
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:39,067
And if you're running this
as just an extension

604
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,033
in your Chrome browser,
then it's "control" and "alt."

605
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:45,367
So I'm going to, uh,
read through this message.

606
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:48,834
[computer speaking rapidly]

607
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,934
computer:
developer.android.com &mdash;

608
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:55,434
developer.android. &mdash;
Sentence.

609
00:22:55,434 --> 00:23:01,300
[computer speaking rapidly
and indistinctly]

610
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,167
S-h-a 256.
S-h-a 256.

611
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,801
Chen: So as you can see,
I can now navigate through it

612
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:10,834
in a very fine-grained way
and go through the message

613
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:13,200
a word at a time,
sentence at a time,

614
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
at any level I would like.

615
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,767
And so with that,
I would like

616
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,234
to hand it back to Brad.

617
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:19,567
Green: Great.
Erin.

618
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,767
Rosenthal: I think that's
actually me.

619
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,133
computer: Not selected.
Chen: Yeah.

620
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,467
So can we switch back?

621
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,567
Rosenthal: Yes.
Green: Thanks, Charles.

622
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:25,801
That's awesome.

623
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:27,067
Rosenthal: Yeah, thank you
so much, Charles.

624
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,300
Chen: You want to ask
questions or should I?

625
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,534
Rosenthal: Um,
so as you can see,

626
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,234
with ChromeVox
you're able to make, like,

627
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:34,200
a desktop-like experience
through your web application

628
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,133
on ChromeOS, right?

629
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,501
Um, ChromeVox
and VoxScripts give you

630
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,934
this unprecedented level
of control

631
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:43,634
to make sure that you have this
tight integration that you want

632
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:45,801
with the screen reader
so that you can provide

633
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:48,067
this seamless user experience
that your users

634
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:52,701
have grown to expect
in their desktop applications.

635
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:55,434
There's also one more technology
that Brad had mentioned

636
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,367
that we wanted to show you
a quick screenshot of

637
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:58,934
and that's ChromeShades.

638
00:23:58,934 --> 00:24:01,467
So, um, this is
an extension available

639
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:05,067
on our website,
and it allows you to visualize

640
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:08,067
what your website
or application looks like

641
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,667
to someone using
a screen reader.

642
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,267
Um, as Brad says,
for people who are

643
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:12,767
photon-dependent.

644
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:15,467
Um, so what it does is
flatten your page

645
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,701
and show it in the link order
that the person

646
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:19,467
who would be navigating
with the screen reader,

647
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,434
how they would come to it
and how they would end up

648
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:22,534
navigating it.

649
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:23,834
So in this case,
you see that the buttons

650
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,367
that are across the top
of the page

651
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,300
end up being linearized
at the beginning

652
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,734
of the ChromeShades version
of the page,

653
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,100
and the "any" button that's
unlabeled in the interface

654
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,100
is showing up as these green,
rounded wraps.

655
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,767
So clearly we have
some work to do here.

656
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:39,234
It's a good thing
we have this tool.

657
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:41,267
So let's talk
a little bit about

658
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:45,067
accessibility in Android.

659
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,300
Mobile platforms are fantastic
platforms for accessibility.

660
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,100
There are so many sensors
built in

661
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,367
that there is this inherent
accessibility

662
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:52,901
that's already there.

663
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:54,934
These devices are designed
for use

664
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:57,601
when being distracted,
when your eyes are elsewhere.

665
00:24:57,601 --> 00:25:01,367
So that helps people who need
accessible interfaces as well.

666
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,534
Plus, um,
Android in particular

667
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:05,834
is an open and customizable
platform, right?

668
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,968
So you can choose the device
that works for you.

669
00:25:07,968 --> 00:25:10,200
You can get one with a keyboard
if you want it.

670
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,133
Plus, also, today,
when we were in the keynote,

671
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,901
we announced the, uh,

672
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:16,667
Android developer platform,
right?

673
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,467
So you can make, uh,
third-party extensions.

674
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,167
So with that,
you could make something

675
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:23,234
that really is specific
to the disabled users

676
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:25,567
in your community.

677
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,767
So as we said, there's all
these sensors built in.

678
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,701
So think of them as all these
eyes and ears

679
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:34,434
that you can use to make
location aware,

680
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:38,000
context aware, and extremely
powerful applications.

681
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,567
Um, the more aware your
application is,

682
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,100
the less that your users need
to interact with it.

683
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,367
While that might sound like
something you don't want &mdash;

684
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:47,067
you want them to interact &mdash;
you don't want them

685
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:50,234
to have to get stuck inputting
all this tedious details,

686
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:51,634
all this data, right?

687
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,734
If you can tell them
their location for them

688
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:55,067
instead of them having
to figure out &mdash;

689
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,767
Like, right now,
do you know where you are

690
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:58,334
if you had to put
in your location?

691
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,367
No, you'd have a hard time,
right?

692
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:02,167
So you really would prefer
your phone

693
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:06,767
to be able to set that for you,
right?

694
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,667
So we've written a couple
applications

695
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,467
that demonstrate this
technology.

696
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:11,801
Um, both of them,
I think,

697
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:14,067
we're demoing over
in our sandbox, by the way,

698
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,467
if you want to check
'em out yourself.

699
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:18,567
Um, this first one is an app
called Walky Talky.

700
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:22,701
Uh, this is a interface
to the maps app

701
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:25,334
that gives you the ability to
set a start and end point

702
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,133
and then it'll give you
walking directions

703
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,634
for the route that you're on.

704
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:30,701
Um, then as you're walking
along your route,

705
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:33,033
it'll read off whatever
intersection you're at.

706
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:35,434
Um, I know for me this would
be incredibly useful

707
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:37,734
if I'm just kind of walking
in an unfamiliar area.

708
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:40,167
I can only imagine how valuable
it would be if I'm blind

709
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,767
and would have a difficult time
seeing exactly where I am.

710
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,434
So this application helps build
that confidence

711
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:47,334
in your environment
in knowing where you are

712
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:49,868
as you're--and that you're
on the right direction.

713
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:52,400
Um, also there's this
application called

714
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,734
Intersection Explorer.

715
00:26:53,734 --> 00:26:55,634
If you went to the Android talk
earlier,

716
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:58,267
you saw a demo of it
and as Ramen explained,

717
00:26:58,267 --> 00:27:00,868
he wrote this, um,
after getting dropped off

718
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:03,267
on the wrong corner one day
on the way home.

719
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:05,968
This app, uh,
helps you to understand

720
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:09,167
what intersections
or what streets are nearby.

721
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,067
So, like, if you're traveling
and want to get to know

722
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:12,968
an area before you
get there and know

723
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:16,234
what the general streets are,
you can, um, open up this app,

724
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,634
set yourself
at an intersection,

725
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,968
and then drag your finger
in a circle,

726
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:22,868
uh, around the intersection
that you're at.

727
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:25,167
Um, it will
then vibrate subtly

728
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:28,067
when you get to a street
and read off the street name

729
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,133
and the direction.

730
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:30,567
So, like, in this case,

731
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,100
if I did a circle,
um, from the top,

732
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,734
it would first say &mdash;
it would vibrate a little

733
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:37,534
and say, "Howard Street,
Northeast."

734
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:38,901
And, um,
that would help me know

735
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:42,601
what streets meet up
where I am.

736
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:44,033
Green: All right, fantastic.

737
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:47,267
So there's several services
that are parallel

738
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:51,601
to what we're doing on ChromeOS
and Chrome for Android

739
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:54,701
and we've had these in place
actually for much longer.

740
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:56,434
There's an accessibility
framework

741
00:27:56,434 --> 00:27:58,234
that's built up
of a number of APIs.

742
00:27:58,234 --> 00:27:59,667
We'll talk about
a few of them.

743
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:02,234
And there are services
which users can enable

744
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:03,667
as part of their preferences.

745
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,234
So on any Android device,
you can pull it out right now.

746
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:08,834
Go to preferences,
accessibility,

747
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,167
and you get to enable things
like TalkBack,

748
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,334
which is our screen reader.

749
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:14,367
Allows the UI to be announced

750
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:16,567
and allows you to navigate
by focusing on elements.

751
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:18,501
We have KickBack,
which is the haptic feedback,

752
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:23,267
which gives me more of a
realistic, real-world experience

753
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:25,701
when I'm interacting with
the different elements.

754
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:27,934
Um, and then SoundBack,
which plays the equivalent

755
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:29,501
of what we called earcons &mdash;

756
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,234
um, audio non-spoken events

757
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:35,300
that tell me when something's
happened in my application.

758
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,667
Again, Erin kind of
mentioned it,

759
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,501
but this is--It's a very
open platform.

760
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,033
It's all open source.

761
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,901
Um, but we've made
it particularly

762
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:46,033
easy to integrate along
many axes.

763
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:48,634
One example is that
we ship a voice

764
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:51,133
with the device for doing
text to speech.

765
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:54,467
And, uh, it's perfectly good
and functional,

766
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:56,701
but if you want a slightly
sexier, sassier voice,

767
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,901
one that happen--works
in a different language,

768
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:00,400
um, or, you know,

769
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,167
one that's just more
to your preference,

770
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,634
you can go
to the marketplace

771
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:05,801
and you can download one of many
different ones

772
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:07,000
that are available there,
uh,

773
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,033
written by some of our
application partners.

774
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:13,267
Okay, so, uh,
these devices &mdash;

775
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:14,868
We've talked a little bit about
what we have to do.

776
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:17,968
More specifically,
if I'm an application developer,

777
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:20,701
to make my application
accessible on Android,

778
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:21,934
uh, the first thing &mdash;

779
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:24,100
If I just use
the standard controls,

780
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,000
out of the box, they come
with accessibility baked in.

781
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,834
If I label those controls

782
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,934
by setting their content
description appropriately,

783
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:33,634
it will automatically know how
to speak the elements

784
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:34,701
when we focus on them.

785
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:35,968
Now, users are going to be

786
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:38,133
focusing on these in maybe
a couple different ways.

787
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:41,567
One is if my device has
a roller ball or a D-pad &mdash;

788
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,968
that sort of directional pad you
see down there on the screen &mdash;

789
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:48,634
it allows me to set focus
on different elements in my UI.

790
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:50,167
The ones that come out
of the box

791
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,834
automatically know how
to be focused.

792
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:56,367
If I'm building my own custom
views however,

793
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:59,100
I need to make sure that all
of these controls

794
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,067
are both reachable and
respond to the right events,

795
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,400
that they could be focused,
and that they will raise

796
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,868
the appropriate accessibility
events.

797
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:06,334
There's some simple APIs.

798
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:07,801
We'll show you a link
where to go to

799
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:10,100
to look at that
at the end of the talk,

800
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,667
um, and please come to our
developer sandbox

801
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:15,968
and we'd love to show you
more about that.

802
00:30:15,968 --> 00:30:18,200
Rosenthal: So, um,
with that, we want to &mdash;

803
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,334
You remember how earlier
we mentioned

804
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:20,434
we were gonna have demos?

805
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:21,801
We're gonna bring up
Steve Jacobs

806
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:23,868
to show us some demos
of some applications

807
00:30:23,868 --> 00:30:27,601
that he's written for Android
that are highly accessible.

808
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,000
Green: And while he's getting
set up,

809
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,467
uh, we could take
another question

810
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:32,100
if somebody has one about
what we've just talked about.

811
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,467
Rosenthal: Let me switch over.

812
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:34,701
Green: Anyone?

813
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,467
Jacobs: Well, if nobody
has any questions &mdash;

814
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,167
Green: Oh--oh,
we have maybe one.

815
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:39,400
No, somebody's escaping.

816
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,467
Okay, good.
Oh, no.

817
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:41,968
You're--Okay, good.
Yes?

818
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:44,033
man: Um, so, uh, it seems like
a lot of people

819
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,968
in this room are already
in charge

820
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:47,901
of the accessibility
for their companies.

821
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:49,801
If you were somebody
who just recognizes

822
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,901
that everyone should be able
to use whatever you write,

823
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,601
what would be a good place
to start

824
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,000
working on accessibility?

825
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,434
Or a good example of
a very accessible website

826
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:03,267
for all sorts of disabilities.

827
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:05,334
Green: So a very accessible
website?

828
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:06,868
Uh, that's a good question.

829
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:08,868
I mean, generally,
simpler websites

830
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,267
are easier to make accessible.

831
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:14,234
Um, there's, uh, I don't know.

832
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:16,367
Charles, do you have an example?

833
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,267
The best example you
could think of?

834
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:19,467
[Chen speaks indistinctly]

835
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:20,767
Yeah, that's true.

836
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:22,601
With ChromeVox,
we have a tutorial.

837
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:24,701
It's--It is highly accessible.

838
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,400
However, it's not particularly
complex.

839
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,868
What I would do is
I'd direct you &mdash;

840
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:29,868
We've got a tech talk tomorrow

841
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:33,601
on building accessible
applications with HTML5,

842
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,701
where we'll actually
walk you through

843
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:38,501
everything you need
to do to build, uh,

844
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,968
dynamic accessible applications.

845
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:43,033
Um, they've got a rich,
uh, application

846
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,734
that they'll walk you through.

847
00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:46,000
Cool.
Thanks.

848
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,100
Steve?

849
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,534
Jacobs: Thank you, Brad.
Thank you, Erin.

850
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,634
Thanks to the audience.

851
00:31:50,634 --> 00:31:54,033
The question was just asked
about an accessible &mdash;

852
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:56,501
an example of
an accessible website.

853
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,267
Building a business case
is important

854
00:31:58,267 --> 00:32:00,067
if you want to integrate
accessibility

855
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,534
within your company.

856
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:02,934
I'm a businessman.

857
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:04,667
I'm in business to make money.

858
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,400
And I'm in business for
applications to be accessible,

859
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,033
usable, and useful
by as many people

860
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,834
around the world as possible.

861
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,000
So for right now,
let's not think about people

862
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,400
with disabilities,
of which there are

863
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,767
826 million worldwide.

864
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:20,801
Let's just
concentrate on, uh,

865
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:22,267
people like myself.

866
00:32:22,267 --> 00:32:24,300
65 years of age and over.

867
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,968
519 million.

868
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:29,367
And 1.2 billion people
who never learned to read.

869
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:30,767
How are they gonna access
your apps

870
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,934
and go shopping
and spend their money?

871
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:35,734
That's where accessibility
is powerful.

872
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,067
Gonna show you two examples
of apps

873
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:40,267
that we recently developed.

874
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:43,701
The first is, um,
Khan Academy.

875
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:48,100
I need to turn on TalkBack's
virtual D-pad.

876
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,267
Um, Khan Academy
is a not-for-profit

877
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:53,534
educational organization
whose mission

878
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:57,834
is to evolutionize education
as we know it in the country.

879
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,868
Uh, actually, around the world.

880
00:32:59,868 --> 00:33:02,834
They have about
10 million students

881
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,734
taking their tutorials.

882
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:09,367
They've developed 2,200
short video tutorials

883
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:13,000
on subjects such as, uh,
history, math, science,

884
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,501
and so on.

885
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:18,868
Using the built in accessibility
that's already in Android,

886
00:33:18,868 --> 00:33:20,968
if I swipe down the D-pad...

887
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:26,100
computer: Math, science,
humanity, science, math.

888
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,934
Jacobs: If I want math
and I hear it,

889
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,200
I don't have to be able
to read.

890
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,467
I just tap it.

891
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,067
computer: KhAndroid.
Arithmetic.

892
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:33,834
The most basic
of the math playlists &mdash;

893
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:34,968
Jacobs: Arithmetic.

894
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:36,067
computer: Developmental math.

895
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:37,434
Jacobs: Developmental math.

896
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:38,901
Arithmetic.

897
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:41,367
computer: Playlists start here
if you--KhAndroid.

898
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,000
Basic addition.
Addition. 271,000...

899
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,400
Jacobs: Let's go
into addition too.

900
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,534
computer: YouTube image button.

901
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:50,067
Jacobs: We will now see &mdash;

902
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:52,734
man: We got some practice
adding what we could &mdash;

903
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,200
computer: Alert phone option.
Jacobs: Oops.

904
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,267
computer: Screen off.

905
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:58,300
[overlapping speech]

906
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,634
man: We could imagine that
if maybe I had three lemons.

907
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:03,400
One, two, three.

908
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,300
And if I were to add
to those three lemons,

909
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,667
maybe two limes.

910
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:08,801
computer: Navigating.

911
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:10,133
man: Is it lime or limes?

912
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,400
Let's just--Well &mdash;

913
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,067
Two green lemons
for two more tart pieces &mdash;

914
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:16,467
Jacobs: We can turn
captions off.

915
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:18,801
man: How much tart,
sour fruit do I have now?

916
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,834
computer: Alert captions.
YouTube.

917
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,400
Jacobs: Or turn them on.

918
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,701
We can pause the video.

919
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:27,767
We can move the video ahead.

920
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:31,100
And I'm going
pretty quick here.

921
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,901
Orientation.

922
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:35,167
man: It means I have no lemons.

923
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:40,400
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...
computer: Typing.

924
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,033
man: 5, 6, 7...
computer: Navigating.

925
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:45,934
man: 8, 9, 10, 11 &mdash;

926
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:48,267
computer: Back, back.

927
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:50,200
Jacobs: Okay.

928
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,601
That's one example.

929
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:55,801
And I wanted to thank,
uh, Casey Burkhardt.

930
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:58,367
Google had a Google I/O &mdash;

931
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:01,167
An accessibility
Google I/O contest

932
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,934
where people submitted code.

933
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,667
And, Casey Burkhardt,
you're in the audience.

934
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,667
Hold your hand up.
Thank you.

935
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:10,267
You submitted code that our
developers were able to use

936
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:12,067
to develop this application.

937
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:16,868
Um, sharing code is part
of the DNA of Android

938
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:18,367
and the Google culture.

939
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,601
It is very, very helpful.

940
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:23,400
Uh, it reduces costs
significantly,

941
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,434
and when we work together
as a community,

942
00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:28,734
it's a very good thing from
a business standpoint.

943
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,567
The second app...

944
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:31,834
computer: Clicked.

945
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,567
Jacobs: I'm going
to demonstrate.

946
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,067
computer: Alert.
Please wait.

947
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:37,701
Jacobs: We've all seen
e-book readers.

948
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:39,734
There has been
a lot of talk lately

949
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:43,434
about e-book readers that can't
read out loud or that won't.

950
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,467
This is CoolReader.

951
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,834
We've simply taken
the open source code

952
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,601
and our developers added speech
and highlighting

953
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:53,200
and extra controls to the app,

954
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,133
all because it's open source and
it's a community of sharing.

955
00:35:57,133 --> 00:36:00,801
This will give you some idea
of the controls that you have

956
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:02,734
just having a touch screen.

957
00:36:02,734 --> 00:36:04,067
Um, let's...

958
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,167
computer: For a whole day &mdash;

959
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,467
Jacobs: read backwards.

960
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:07,767
computer: For a whole day &mdash;

961
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:09,868
Indeed, my only wonder was
that he had not

962
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:10,968
already been mixed up in &mdash;

963
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,834
I was not surprised.

964
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,767
Jacobs: Or we can read one word
at a time.

965
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,167
computer: Word.

966
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:18,234
Violent.
Kings.

967
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:19,467
Sentence.

968
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,534
Jacobs: Or go back to sen &mdash;

969
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:21,901
Okay, we're back
to the sentence.

970
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:24,334
Let's go into night mode.

971
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:25,901
You can see it better.

972
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:27,767
We'll go back into day mode.

973
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:30,901
We can turn a page
or turn it back

974
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:34,000
or increase the size
of the font.

975
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,767
We can do that again.

976
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:39,400
Maybe again.

977
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,167
So people who are not
able to read,

978
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,400
who are learning to read,

979
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,133
learning English
as a second language,

980
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,667
Young students who want
to be able

981
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,300
to access resources
like this,

982
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,601
having an interface
that is accessible

983
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,300
can enable them to do that.

984
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,133
It is very, very powerful.

985
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:56,934
So expand your thinking
about accessibility

986
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:59,534
beyond disabilities,
if you're narrowly focused

987
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:00,868
on disabilities.

988
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:03,267
Couple of other features
and then I'll stop.

989
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:05,801
Uh, we can go
to the table of contents...

990
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:07,000
computer: Alert.
Table of contents.

991
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,267
CoolReader.

992
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,834
Jacobs: And turn some pages.

993
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:11,834
I can dim the screen
if I want to.

994
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,634
I can brighten the screen.

995
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:16,901
There are 20 commands
built into the touch screen

996
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,300
in 9 little areas.

997
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,400
We actually make
templates that we can put

998
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,400
over as screen savers
that enable the students

999
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,868
who are blind
that we work with

1000
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:29,667
to fully control this
application,

1001
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,534
fully control KhAndroid and many
of the other applications

1002
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,167
we develop.

1003
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,667
Thank you.

1004
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,801
Rosenthal: Thanks, Steve.

1005
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:38,033
Jacobs: Welcome.

1006
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,234
Rosenthal: Let me switch
back over.

1007
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:40,634
Green: All right.

1008
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:41,801
Steve, that's awesome.
That's wonderful.

1009
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,133
So I want to just
kind of reiterate

1010
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:45,334
a couple of the points
about Steve's demo.

1011
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:47,868
On CoolReader,
they were using gestures,

1012
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:50,567
notice, that didn't require
a user to look at the screen.

1013
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:53,734
A user, no matter where they
started from in their gestures,

1014
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:55,701
they always kind of knew
how it would make sense.

1015
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:57,667
Some of them were relative to
different parts of the screen,

1016
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,400
but I didn't need
to see the screen.

1017
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,734
And then they provided a lot
of verbal feedback to the user.

1018
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:05,133
So the user, again,
could know what was going on

1019
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:07,300
without seeing what was
on the screen.

1020
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,667
KhAndroid is a fantastic example
of rethinking, uh &mdash;

1021
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,901
How do I make it possible
for more users

1022
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:16,734
to use my application by adding
other modes of accessibility?

1023
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:19,367
Um, and we're really proud that
they were able to reuse

1024
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:23,801
some of the code from the
developer challenge that we had.

1025
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,100
Rosenthal: So let's talk
a little bit about

1026
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,501
making your products accessible
for people who are deaf

1027
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:29,901
or hard of hearing.

1028
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:32,200
Um, as Dr. I. King Jordan said,

1029
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,868
"Deaf people can do anything
but hear."

1030
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:37,033
Um, and by the way,
Dr. I. King Jordan

1031
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:39,567
was the first deaf president
of Gallaudet University,

1032
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,400
which was the first university

1033
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,868
for deaf and hard
of hearing students.

1034
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:45,968
Their entire curriculum is for &mdash;
is in ASL.

1035
00:38:45,968 --> 00:38:50,367
Um, so, uh, mobile devices
and deaf communities &mdash;

1036
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:52,300
Um, sorry.

1037
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,000
Uh, mobile devices were rapidly
adopted by the deaf community.

1038
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,367
I mean, when you think
about it,

1039
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,200
um, deaf people do more than
just, you know &mdash;

1040
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,868
We do more with our cell phones
than just talk on them, right?

1041
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:03,300
I, you know, increasingly
use my cell phone

1042
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,534
less and less for phone calls

1043
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,234
and more for other
text-based things

1044
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:09,133
like text chatting and SMS
and now for things

1045
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:12,000
like video chatting
and watching videos, right?

1046
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,400
So watching videos
with captions

1047
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,501
goes well with that.

1048
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:19,434
We have, um,
Jaehong Chon here

1049
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:21,834
from the University
of Washington

1050
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:24,334
to show us this great
application that they've built

1051
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:25,934
to customize, uh &mdash;

1052
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:28,267
So you can go ahead
and plug in.

1053
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:29,400
Chon: Thanks for doing this.

1054
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,501
Rosenthal: Wait.
Hold on.

1055
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,734
Some of the great technologies

1056
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:33,734
that they've built
to help make a great

1057
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:35,167
video chat experience
for deaf users.

1058
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,801
Chon: Okay, um,
it's my great honor

1059
00:39:36,801 --> 00:39:38,200
to present our work here.

1060
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,300
Rosenthal: Do you want to &mdash;

1061
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,334
Chon: Yeah, so.

1062
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:43,200
Rosenthal: There we go.
Switch over.

1063
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,501
Chon: Yeah.

1064
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:46,868
That's okay.

1065
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:49,033
Just show them after
presenting the slide.

1066
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,234
Rosenthal: Yes, oh, right.

1067
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:51,467
We're still on slides.
Sorry.

1068
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:54,033
Chon: Yeah, that's fine.

1069
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:55,434
Rosenthal: There you go.

1070
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,567
It's over here.

1071
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:57,834
Chon: Yeah.
Thank you.

1072
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,901
Um, basically,
I'm a Ph student at U-Dub

1073
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:03,234
to work on Google
as their project.

1074
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,334
It all started
about six years ago,

1075
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:08,501
and then we conduct a vista last
year, like this picture,

1076
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:10,801
uh, using, uh,
the old platform.

1077
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:14,300
So last year, we decided
to move to Android

1078
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,968
to give the same access
to Android Word.

1079
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:21,267
But the reason is that basically
there are some &mdash;

1080
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:24,501
a system like VRS,
video relay service,

1081
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:26,400
but it requires high-speed,

1082
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,100
uh, internet service,
to afford them that access.

1083
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,400
So it means they cannot
use the system on the go.

1084
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,033
So our goal is to provide
the same access,

1085
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:38,667
um, where they &mdash;
wherever they are.

1086
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:40,934
So we built the video chat
for sign language

1087
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:44,734
and then working on the cellular
network as well as the wi-fi.

1088
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:49,067
So the reason choose
the cellular network

1089
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:53,467
is that we can give
that access everywhere.

1090
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:55,667
And then so we
optimize something

1091
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,567
to enable the technology.

1092
00:40:57,567 --> 00:41:01,501
So we, uh, investigate
to speed up the encoder

1093
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,167
to enable--to provide
the video code,

1094
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:07,167
as well as the &mdash;
providing low &mdash;

1095
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:10,667
low bit rate to be transmitted
over the network.

1096
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:15,200
So I've brought
some video here.

1097
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,100
So our target bit rate
is 32 bits per second.

1098
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,400
On the left top,
there's the original video.

1099
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,968
First of all,

1100
00:41:21,968 --> 00:41:24,734
we want it to detect
the skin area.

1101
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:27,234
And then, uh,
give to us too some blocks

1102
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,300
to be encoded
with a higher bit rate.

1103
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,033
So finally, at the bottom,

1104
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,801
there's two different videos.

1105
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:35,567
The right side,
uh,

1106
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:39,000
it used that information
to encode &mdash;

1107
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,634
to be, um, better quality.

1108
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:44,467
It means the less to build,
it would be to--relative

1109
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,367
to meet the same
amount of bit.

1110
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:49,434
And then that bit rate
can be easily transmitted

1111
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:51,734
over [indistinct]
network.

1112
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:53,367
Rosenthal: So were you able
to get the demo to work

1113
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:54,501
or do you want
to show the video?

1114
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:55,667
Chon: Uh, show the video.

1115
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:57,000
Rosenthal: Okay.

1116
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,133
Chon: So, actually, uh,

1117
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:01,400
I've asked the people &mdash;

1118
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,901
We decided to move
to Android Word,

1119
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:06,234
so we built the system
from last year

1120
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:08,801
and then we had the working
system here,

1121
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:10,834
but because of network issue,

1122
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:12,567
it is not working
well perfectly.

1123
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:17,000
So I will show that demo
using the prerecorded video.

1124
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,400
I took that video
yesterday night

1125
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,367
with the [indistinct] network.

1126
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:25,067
So, uh, seems to be better,
but up here, it's not working.

1127
00:42:25,067 --> 00:42:27,667
So please come by
our sandbox booth.

1128
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,334
We're gonna show more
information.

1129
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:30,467
Thank you.

1130
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,000
Rosenthal: Great.
Thanks, Jaehong.

1131
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,200
Chon: Yeah.

1132
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,934
Rosenthal: Okay, back to this.

1133
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:39,367
So, um, to summarize,

1134
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,000
there are some key things
that you can do

1135
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,734
to make your applications
accessible.

1136
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:45,434
One is to just make sure you
understand your users

1137
00:42:45,434 --> 00:42:48,267
and the use cases under which
they'll be using your products.

1138
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:50,801
Um, focus on mating &mdash;
making products

1139
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,467
that enable independence
and have multiple

1140
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:55,701
ways of interacting so that
you don't end up relying

1141
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:58,167
on one method
like using a mouse.

1142
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,534
That you have
redundant methods

1143
00:42:59,534 --> 00:43:01,100
like using a keyboard.

1144
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,367
Um, make sure that
you provide good feedback

1145
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:05,534
in your applications
so that your users

1146
00:43:05,534 --> 00:43:07,801
know where they are
at all times.

1147
00:43:07,801 --> 00:43:10,934
And also, think of your entire
end-to-end experience

1148
00:43:10,934 --> 00:43:13,467
from the moment they log in
or even browse your pro &mdash;

1149
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:16,067
Like, to browse your website
to learn about your product,

1150
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:18,133
to the point where
they're setting it up

1151
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,133
using the settings and,
uh,

1152
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:22,200
looking up documentation.

1153
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,334
Green: That's right.

1154
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:24,400
So just to leave you with

1155
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,601
a couple points from the talk.

1156
00:43:25,601 --> 00:43:26,767
Our standard toolkits
come with

1157
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:28,133
great accessibility built in.

1158
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:29,234
Use them.

1159
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,033
There's a couple things
that, uh &mdash;

1160
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:32,334
We want to make sure
the biggest thing

1161
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:33,834
you could do is to make sure
that your application

1162
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:36,033
can be used by
the keyboard alone

1163
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,567
if it's a web app,
or can be focused and used

1164
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:42,234
by a trackpad or a roller ball

1165
00:43:42,234 --> 00:43:44,934
if it's a mobile application.

1166
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:46,767
Uh, I want to make sure
that I'm handling

1167
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:50,100
tab and focus events properly,
whether I'm in Android

1168
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,634
or on the web.

1169
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:53,968
And then test it in
the type of accessibility

1170
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:55,300
technology that
you want to target.

1171
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,367
So download ChromeVox and try
your application out.

1172
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,100
Um, or use the, uh,

1173
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,334
TalkBack
on the Android platform.

1174
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:04,801
Rosenthal: So there's
a number of ways

1175
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:06,601
where you can learn
more about accessibility

1176
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:07,968
while you're here at I/O.

1177
00:44:07,968 --> 00:44:09,767
Um, the first one was
unfortunately a session

1178
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,100
that was earlier today,
which you're gonna

1179
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,834
have to catch on YouTube,
but it was great.

1180
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,067
It was a session
on using Android

1181
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:16,200
and making your Android apps
accessible.

1182
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,234
Tomorrow &mdash;
Uh, tomorrow at 12:30,

1183
00:44:18,234 --> 00:44:19,934
we have a session
on YouTube,

1184
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:23,167
captioning API and speech
recognition and WebVTT.

1185
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,601
And then from 3:00 to 4:00
tomorrow afternoon,

1186
00:44:25,601 --> 00:44:27,434
we have a presentation
on, um,

1187
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:30,567
making accessible web apps
using HTML5.

1188
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:33,167
Then all day
today and tomorrow,

1189
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:36,501
we have a developer sandbox
out here on the second floor.

1190
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:38,067
It's one of the yellow booths,

1191
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:40,000
for those of you who are
photon-dependent.

1192
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,667
Um, there's eight different
stations there

1193
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:44,901
and you can get a better sense
of all these applications

1194
00:44:44,901 --> 00:44:46,200
and use them yourselves.

1195
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,734
Um, the demos will be there.

1196
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:51,133
And then we also have office
hours right now, actually.

1197
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:54,501
Uh, started at 3:00
and going until 6:30 today.

1198
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:56,868
And then tomorrow
from 3:00 to 5:00.

1199
00:44:56,868 --> 00:44:58,834
And those are, again,
on the second floor.

1200
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:01,067
If you walk around,
there's three little nooks

1201
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:05,567
and we're in the last one,
um, outside the room at the end.

1202
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:06,767
Green: Great, okay.

1203
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:08,033
So to give us feedback,
we would love

00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,334
There's a QR code at the top
or you can just type in

1206
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,067
the feedback link.

1207
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:15,067
The links for the other things
we referenced

1208
00:45:15,067 --> 00:45:17,634

including how to download,

00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:20,400
uh, ChromeVox and ChromeVis &mdash;

1210
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,734
uh, I'm sorry &mdash;
