1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,050
Hello.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:06,930
Welcome.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,770
This is the second part of our
DevTools tips and tricks.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,790
So in this part, we're going to
take a look at some of the

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,900
internals or some of the ways
you can extend DevTools or

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,355
even use it in different ways
for different applications

8
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:23,030
entirely, which I think
is very cool.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,890
So once again, you can follow
along by going to

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,640
bit.ly/devtools-tips.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,900
You can see the slides.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,810
You can see the examples.

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,485
You can follow the links.

14
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:35,890
But in the meantime, just check
out some of the things

15
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,225
that you can do with DevTools.

16
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:40,210
So the first thing that we
talked about in the previous

17
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,140
episode, when we actually looked
at DevTools, was the

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,300
Audit panel.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,480
And the really cool part about
the Audit panel, we saw a

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,850
couple of built-in audits, like
network and performance.

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,200
But you can add your own
functionality into here, which

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,930
is really nice.

23
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,040
So if you have any sort of style
guidelines or team best

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,680
practices or other things that
you have agreement on with

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,770
your team, you can actually
codify them into this plugin,

26
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,720
inject them right into DevTools,
and just hit Run,

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,400
and it'll verify.

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,090
We have this silly example
here, but I think it

29
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,110
illustrates the point of
Readability plugin, which just

30
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,100
looks at, hey, the font
size on this page

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,930
is maybe too small.

32
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,270
It's not legible.

33
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,850
We should bump it up.

34
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,940
So to get this functionality, it
literally just takes about

35
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,270
10 lines of JavaScript.

36
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,000
So first, we're going to add
a new audit category called

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Readability.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,470
And then, we're going to inject
the feedback that we

39
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,340
want back to the user.

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,360
So we're going to say,
we found two styles

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,170
with a small font.

42
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,950
So I guess I should say that
when you run this audit, you

43
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,830
have access to the page.

44
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,990
So you can do all of your logic,
and then, based on

45
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,130
that, you would admit
these rules.

46
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,320
So we found two styles with the
small font, and we can add

47
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,510
severity and other things, and
all of the sudden, you're

48
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,680
looking at this nice report
in Chrome DevTools.

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,570
So you can find broken links,
best practices, et cetera.

50
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,750
Now, very, very handy.

51
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,740
So if you're finding yourself
repeating the same work at any

52
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,540
point in time, this
is the tool that

53
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,835
you want to be using.

54
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:13,110
Similarly, you can actually
extend the panel in Chrome,

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,680
which is to say, instead of just
adding functionality into

56
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,570
the Audit panel, you can
put it into other

57
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,560
places within Chrome.

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,870
So for example, we've just added
this Font Picker panel,

59
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,810
which can live in all the
various locations.

60
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,120
And you click on an element, you
can have [? contextual ?]

61
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,970
control of that element.

62
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,350
You can actually inject
additional properties, like

63
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,880
what is a font name
and other things.

64
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,560
So if you have your Templating
Engine or some other

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,950
framework, you can actually
embed some of the additional

66
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,650
functionality right
into Chrome.

67
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,780
Once again, quite nice.

68
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,765
A little bit more advanced
than Audit.

69
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:52,950
But nonetheless, this is the
right tool if that's what

70
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,000
you're looking for.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,310
Now, this one is kind
of interesting.

72
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,235
I know that I've certainly
spent &mdash;

73
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:00,640
I feel fine admitting it &mdash; that
I spent way too much time

74
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,815
customizing all of my various
IDs for what's the perfect,

75
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:09,290
ideal color scheme and font
sizes, et cetera.

76
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,600
Good news, you can actually
do the same thing in

77
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,810
DevTools, as well.

78
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,850
I know that I certainly spend a
lot of time in DevTools, and

79
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,830
I like that to be consistent
with the rest of the system.

80
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,710
So you can actually drop in
your own custom CSS to

81
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,700
re-style all of the style sheets
or all of DevTools.

82
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,690
And you can check out
these slides later.

83
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,890
There's this link to a post that
I put together, which has

84
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,140
a lot of really cool and
nice looking themes.

85
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,340
You can just drop that in and
completely re-style your

86
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,710
Chrome DevTools, which
is quite cool &mdash;

87
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,812
and the supplies on
all platforms.

88
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:47,310
Now, debugging is something
that we get a lot

89
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,940
of questions about.

90
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,960
This is a very, very powerful
feature of Chrome.

91
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,875
So this applies to both mobile
and regular debugging.

92
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,860
So there are two ways

93
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,050
basically to leverage debugging.

94
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,140
One is you start your Chrome
instance with this extra flag

95
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,670
called Remote Debugging
port, and then you

96
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,920
give it a port number.

97
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,950
And similarly, when you're
running on your phone, you

98
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,235
just need to set up
port forwarding.

99
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:13,270
So for example, I have
my Android phone.

100
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,695
I can connect it
to my computer.

101
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:16,875
I have Chrome running
on my phone.

102
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,314
ADB is the Android Debugger.

103
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:23,440
So I'm just going to set up port
forwarding, and then you

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,790
can debug your web pages that
are running on your phone but

105
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,030
directly in your DevTools.

106
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,450
So let me show you an
actual example here.

107
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,820
So I'm going to start Chrome
Canary with the

108
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,206
remote-debugging-port=9222.

109
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:39,990
I'm going to run this.

110
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,210
It opened this guy right here.

111
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,676
I'm just going to
open google.com.

112
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,610
So far, nothing too
interesting.

113
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,840
It works.

114
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,040
Now, in this other tab, I'm
going to do something

115
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,400
interesting.

116
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,515
We know that we are running
the debugger on port 922.

117
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:57,940
So if I just send the request
to the /JSON endpoint, it

118
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,790
actually returns me a bunch
of metadata about

119
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,715
all the open tabs.

120
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:04,730
And in here, you can see that
the first tab that is open is,

121
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,015
in fact, google.com, which is
the page that we opened.

122
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:07,880
No surprise.

123
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,430
And we also give you this
WebSocket Debugger URL, which

124
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,730
means that we can connect to
this endpoint and start doing

125
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,510
interesting things.

126
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,570
And of course, at this point,
you're probably asking what

127
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,012
are those interesting things?

128
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:28,670
Well, if we go back, one thing
you can do is actually take

129
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,650
another client, which is not
even necessarily DevTools,

130
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,120
connect that tool to Chrome
and drive it.

131
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,930
So for example, here I have
just a very simple Ruby

132
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,630
Script, which will actually
drive Chrome and drive it

133
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,230
through the debugging protocol
that we support in Chrome.

134
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,440
So let's take a look at
what's happening here.

135
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,180
We query this URL that
we just saw.

136
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,105
We fetch the first WebSocket
Debugger URL.

137
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,670
So this would be
our Google URL.

138
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,420
And then we connect
to it, and we just

139
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,490
send a couple of commands.

140
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,720
The first one is network.enable,
which means

141
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,590
that, hey, I want you to enable
network debugging from

142
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,180
this point forward.

143
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,930
I want to get data for this.

144
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,110
So think of it just as in
your Chrome DevTools.

145
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,180
You're clicking on the
Network panel.

146
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,940
That's effectively what
you're doing here.

147
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,940
And then the next request,
request number two, I'm

148
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,680
saying, hey, please navigate
yourself &mdash; so I'm talking to

149
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,620
this specific tab &mdash;

150
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,185
please navigate to twitter.com
and search for DevTools.

151
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:26,560
OK.

152
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,610
So far, so good.

153
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,280
And Chrome will do that, and it
will actually then spit out

154
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,170
all of this network data.

155
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,080
And how is it going to look?

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,040
Well, it's going to look
something like this, except

157
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,830
there's going to be lots
and lots more data.

158
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,270
So for example, as we're loading
Twitter, there's a lot

159
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,260
of resources on that page.

160
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,130
You're going to see a lot
of requests coming in.

161
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:45,660
Here's an example.

162
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,860
We have a request that is being
made by Chrome, and

163
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,660
Chrome was logging this,
saying, look,

164
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,190
I'm making XHR requests.

165
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,630
This is an AJAX request.

166
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,445
I'm asking for the current
trends in English language.

167
00:06:57,445 --> 00:07:00,745
By the way, I got a 200
for this request.

168
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:02,260
I didn't use the cache.

169
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,750
I didn't reuse the connection
for whatever reason.

170
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,250
And by the way, here's all of
the timing data for this

171
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,550
request &mdash; how long I spent
connecting, doing a DNS

172
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,620
lookup, and other things.

173
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,120
So kind of very low level, but
it's, once again, all the data

174
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,400
you would need to construct
your Timeline or something

175
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,330
else, which actually hints at
the next thing, which is

176
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,060
Chrome DevTools, itself,
is a web app.

177
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,775
So once again, we have our
Chrome Canary here.

178
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:33,430
So these two are two different
versions of Canary, and this

179
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,610
is a regular version
of Chrome.

180
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,025
So we have the debugger
running on

181
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,275
the one on the right.

182
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:43,460
So I'm going to go into here
and go to localhost:9222.

183
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,280
This is where we run
the debugger.

184
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,930
And look at that.

185
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,480
We have the tab.

186
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,380
We can see the tab that we
have opened, which is

187
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:51,790
google.com.

188
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,320
And if I click on this, it'll
load up DevTools.

189
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
And you'll notice that as I
hover over the different

190
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,750
elements, it actually
highlights it on

191
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,860
the page on the right.

192
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,000
So this is one instance of
Chrome talking to another.

193
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,650
This is the same workflow that
would happen when you're

194
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,300
running it on your phone.

195
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,810
We're just doing it with
two side-by-side

196
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,345
Chrome run times here.

197
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,000
So why is this interesting?

198
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,610
Well, this really highlights
the fact that DevTools,

199
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,170
itself, is a web app.

200
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,890
And just to prove the point, we
can actually open DevTools

201
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,060
on DevTools.

202
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,620
So if you're seeing double,
that's as intended, because,

203
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,216
for example, as I hover &mdash;

204
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:29,630
whoops.

205
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,350
That's the wrong one.

206
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,820
If I hover on this element
here, you can

207
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,900
actually see it being &mdash;

208
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,020
so here I'm debugging DevTools
on the right, which is

209
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,975
debugging this page.

210
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,940
So going a little bit meta here,
but this is very cool,

211
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,590
which means that you
can take this code.

212
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,990
You can actually modify it.

213
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,985
If you have some really awesome
improvement that

214
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,440
you've wanted on DevTools, we'd
love to hear what it is.

215
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,960
You can go right in, modify it,
play with it, and do all

216
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,530
kinds of interesting stuff.

217
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,210
So let me close that.

218
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,576
It can get a little
bit confusing.

219
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:02,540
Let's go back in here.

220
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,760
So we talked about connecting
to a debug endpoint.

221
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:15,050
We talked about consuming the
WebSocket feed, and in fact,

222
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,740
that's what DevTools uses.

223
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,850
It connects to the WebSocket
endpoint, consumes that data,

224
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,080
and then just puts everything
to the screen.

225
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,070
But what if something else
generated this debug feed?

226
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,570
And this is an example
I love to use.

227
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,590
I think this is really,
really cool.

228
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,260
So guys at square.com built this
really cool open source

229
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,720
project called PonyDebugger.

230
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,490
And their observation was
that, hey, we use Chrome

231
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,330
DevTools all the time for
developing our web apps.

232
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,310
We'd like to use it for
developing our native apps,

233
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,370
our iOS apps.

234
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,280
So what they did was they
started emitting.

235
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,610
So they basically looked
at our debug

236
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,870
protocol, which is defined.

237
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,570
You can actually find
the docs in it.

238
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,970
And they are emitting this data
straight out of their

239
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,810
native apps, iOS apps.

240
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,985
And their apps are making
requests through the network.

241
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,210
So they're just opening this
data, and they're then

242
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,810
connecting to this WebSocket
endpoint with DevTools.

243
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,800
And they can see all of the data
as you would expect, all

244
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,810
of the network waterfalls,
and all of the rest.

245
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,810
So this is iOS device emitting
these events, and it's

246
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,460
basically debugging it in Chrome
DevTools, which I think

247
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,280
is really, really awesome.

248
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,280
And not only that, but, of
course, you also have Core

249
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,560
Data in iOS.

250
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,850
So they were able to hook up
Core Data and use Chrome

251
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,880
DevTools to drill in directly.

252
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,470
So for example, you have User
Model, and User Model has all

253
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,010
different properties,
et cetera.

254
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,310
So once again, this is Chrome
DevTools being used to debug

255
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:48,204
not Chrome, but something else
entirely, which is awesome.

256
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:50,580
Now, shifting gears
a little bit &mdash;

257
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,550
benchmarking.

258
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,890
Benchmarking is a very hard
thing to do right, very easy

259
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,120
to get wrong, because you tend
to forget something.

260
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
And it's easy to forget
something, because there's so

261
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,630
many different layers of caches,
socket pools, and

262
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,100
other things that are being
maintained by your browser, by

263
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,590
your operating system, your
DNS caches, et cetera.

264
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,640
So we have a very handy tool
that can help you do this

265
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,390
better or do it right.

266
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,030
And to get that running, you
actually need to install an

267
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,955
additional extension.

268
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:22,840
It's the Chrome Benchmarking
Extension.

269
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,360
You can install it from
the Chrome App Store.

270
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,710
And then to make use of it,
you actually need to start

271
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,040
Chrome with a new flag.

272
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,850
So just like previously we were
using Remote Debugging

273
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,520
flag, here we need to
enable benchmarking.

274
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,460
And what this allows the
extension to do is it gives it

275
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,240
control to be able to close all
the socket pools, flush

276
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,190
those, flush the DNS cache,
all kinds of internals of

277
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,075
Chrome that you don't get
exposed to day to day.

278
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:56,710
So combining those two together,
they'll help you

279
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,245
automate benchmarking.

280
00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:00,190
And I'll show you this
in a second.

281
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:06,560
One other tip that I have is
this is specific to OS X, I

282
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,780
should say.

283
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,130
But if you're running on a Mac,
there's this very cool

284
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,800
app that's not related to Chrome
at all called Appify,

285
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,110
which allows you to take any
sort of command with a couple

286
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,775
of parameters and wrap it into
what looks like an app.

287
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:26,072
So sound simple?

288
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:27,660
So I have Chrome Benchmark.

289
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,330
I just package it as an
app so I can run this.

290
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,116
Actually, to do that I would
have to quit this.

291
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:35,605
So Benchmark &mdash;

292
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,600
it'll start up an instance
of Chrome.

293
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,786

294
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:43,145
There we go.

295
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:45,950
And so we're running with this
flag, and the extension is

296
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,250
right here.

297
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,705
I'm going to load it up.

298
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:50,490
And it gives me this interface,
where I can type in

299
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,250
a couple of different URLs or,
in fact, as many as you want.

300
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,710
You can load an entire file.

301
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,920
I'm going to just run this
against two endpoints.

302
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,520
So google.com and, let's
say, yahoo.com.

303
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,865
So you can specify the
number of iterations.

304
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:07,430
I'm going to say three.

305
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,720
We don't have all day.

306
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,700
Clear connections,
clear cache &mdash;

307
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,620
I'm not going to test
for a SPDY, but this

308
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,630
can do a SPDY check.

309
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,545
So hit Run and watch
what happens.

310
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:20,160
So now this extension is
literally opening up these

311
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,930
tabs, firing off these requests,
loads the page,

312
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,160
closes the tab, flushes
everything, repeats this

313
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,320
process, and is going to do it
three times for each of the

314
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,190
URLs we specified.

315
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,190
So this is basically automating
this experience.

316
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,860
And the best part is that it
aggregates all of this data

317
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,990
and gives us a report
afterwards.

318
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,530
So wow, the Yahoo! pages are
taking quite a while to load

319
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,782
for whatever reason.

320
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:47,952
So now we're loading
google.com.

321
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,330
And you can see that here
we've had three

322
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,572
runs in each case.

323
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:56,440
As you saw, so we have standard
deviation in the load

324
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,770
time, so one of the pages
took a long time.

325
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,450
So the standard deviation
was really high.

326
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,990
I wonder what happened there.

327
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,580
And we can also just
click on these two

328
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,870
guys and click Compare.

329
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,390
And you can see that the Google
pages were pretty

330
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,510
consistent.

331
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,730
Something funny happened
there.

332
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,940
Maybe it was my network.

333
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,420
But you can see the huge
variation between these runs

334
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,710
for yahoo.com.

335
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,010
So you can put in more URLs.

336
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,960
Definitely use this tool.

337
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,680
It gives you nice metrics for
things like load meantime,

338
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,640
time to first paint, which is
very handy, the meantime, and

339
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,300
a number of other things.

340
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,620
So very handy if you're doing
any sort of benchmarking.

341
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,406
This is the way you
should do it.

342
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:44,190
And speaking of the internals
of the Chrome networking

343
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,630
stack, there's actually quite
a bit of data that you have

344
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,330
access to if you're trying to
debug the performance of your

345
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:51,915
application.

346
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:55,700
So we have the Omnibox,
which &mdash; and this is

347
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,130
kind of on the side.

348
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,730
This is more personal curiosity,
if you will.

349
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,415
But we have the Omnibox, which
helps you with autocomplete

350
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:05,210
and trying to help you figure
out where you're trying to go.

351
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,880
So all of this data is stored
in Chrome Predictor.

352
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,150
So if you just grab this and
type it into your Chrome and

353
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,440
hit Enter, you'll see all the
predictions that Chrome stores

354
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,920
that you've typed, and you can
see the guesses that Chrome

355
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,060
will make, which actually
makes for quite

356
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,986
interesting to explore.

357
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:25,800
The other section that I'll
highlight is Chrome

358
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,280
net-internals.

359
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,500
If you happen to play with us,
you definitely should.

360
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,670
There's a lot of useful
tools hidden in here.

361
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,980
So if I go into Chrome
net-internals &mdash;

362
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,090
let me go into Sockets, and here
you can see all of the

363
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,380
open sockets currently
in Chrome.

364
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,580
You can actually flush them.

365
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,330
You can close them.

366
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,630
You can do all kinds of stuff.

367
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,062
You can look at your
current cache.

368
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:51,260
So Timeline DNS, the records
that are being kept by Chrome.

369
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,690
So all this data is in here.

370
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,320
And I'll show you one specific
example for SPDY.

371
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,705
So SPDY is a layer below HTTP.

372
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:08,150
So when you look at resources
fetched via SPDY, you actually

373
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,590
won't see any difference in
your Timeline, because

374
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,650
basically it's just HTTP.

375
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,425
But they do look different
on the wire.

376
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,965
So right now, we have two
SPDY connections open.

377
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,350
Now, let me show
you an example.

378
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,650
So I have this really silly
spdy.io which just prints

379
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,975
"Hello World." There
you have it.

380
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:32,850
We can go back into our Chrome

381
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,300
net-internals, and look at that.

382
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,510
We have a SPDY connection that
is currently open to the

383
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,370
server, and we have
the ID of it.

384
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,160
So we can click on this, and
you see the actual session.

385
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,970
You click on that, and all of
a sudden, you see all of the

386
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,070
data as it is on the wire.

387
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,080
So these are the SPDY frames
being exchanged between the

388
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,660
client and the server.

389
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,360
So we're sending a [? Sen ?]

390
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,235
Stream with all kinds
of parameters.

391
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:57,890
This should look
very familiar.

392
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,560
It's basically HCP,
but it is wrapped

393
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,680
in a different protocol.

394
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,416
So if you're curious about SPDY,
if you want to play with

395
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,349
it, if you want to just explore
it, this is the place

396
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:11,002
to take a peek and learn
what's happening.

397
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:13,428
So let's close that
and head back.

398
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:16,770
Similarly, Chrome stores a
lot of histogram data.

399
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,089
So this is performance-related
data specific to your browser.

400
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,630
This data is collected
throughout the lifetime of the

401
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,569
browser or since
you opened it.

402
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:29,210
So you can look at things like
what is the average or the

403
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,490
mean or what is the
distribution, actually, of the

404
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,970
DNS look-ups.

405
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,820
So if I open this, there's a
lot of histograms in here.

406
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,110
But if I look for
DNS Success &mdash;

407
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,562
let me just look for Success &mdash;

408
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,240
Attempt Success Duration.

409
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,820
So you can see that most of the
DNS requests that I make

410
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,550
get completed very fast, so
within zero milliseconds,

411
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,030
which means their cached, which
is exactly what we want.

412
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,080
But then there's this long tail,
and then there's this

413
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,350
funny spike at about
300 milliseconds.

414
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,930
So this is the detailed
histogram metadata about just

415
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,400
your network performance.

416
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,600
So if you have a suspicion that
maybe your ISP or your

417
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,865
DNS server's not working well,
this is the place to find out.

418
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:14,020
Lots of other data aside from
DNS in here, as well.

419
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,642
So just fun to play
around with.

420
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:20,000
And the last thing that I'll
mention, and this is more

421
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,470
specific to Chrome, so some of
these other things like socket

422
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,680
pools and other things are
basically present in all the

423
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,590
web browsers today.

424
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,170
One of the nice features of
Chrome is that it actually

425
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,090
learns the topology of
the network or your

426
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:31,920
site, if you will.

427
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,470
So let's say I have never
visited cnn.com, The first

428
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,240
time I load it, Chrome knows
nothing about it.

429
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,955
So we just go about loading
the page as you would.

430
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:44,880
But we remember which
sub-domains or which domains

431
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,000
we've used to fetch some
of those resources.

432
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,860
So for example, if you're
putting a lot of your assets

433
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,070
on some CDN and we're fetching
a lot of resources, we'll

434
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,790
remember that.

435
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,260
Such that the next time you load
cnn.com, we will actually

436
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,380
see if it makes sense to
preemptively open that

437
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,170
connection to your CDN.

438
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,725
Such that when you do make that
request for the asset, we

439
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:08,010
already have the connection
open, and it

440
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,195
can be fetched faster.

441
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,060
Now, that doesn't mean that
Chrome will do that every

442
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,540
single time, but in this example
for igvita.com, you

443
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,865
can see that these are the
resources that we remembered.

444
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:22,140
We know that this page uses
the Google Fonts.

445
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,410
It uses a Plus Button.

446
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,550
It uses Google Analytics.

447
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,850
So we've remembered those, and
next time around, we may

448
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,850
actually use this information
to speed up the

449
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,280
performance of your site.

450
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,800
So very interesting and fun
to play around with.

451
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,880
And you can go into the
Chrome/DNS and look at these

452
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,365
host names and see what's
happening there.

453
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:49,810
Now, this last one here
is chrome://tracing.

454
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,050
Very powerful, very
interesting.

455
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,340
It was originally built by
and for Chrome engineers.

456
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,910
So we were trying to figure
out how to improve

457
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,660
performance of Chrome.

458
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,265
What's actually happening in
the guts of Chrome, itself?

459
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:05,210
But a lot of people have started
using this, because it

460
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,280
is, in fact, very useful, not
just for understanding how

461
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,880
Chrome works, but how your code

462
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,760
interacts with Chrome code.

463
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,230
So for example, if you're
running, or if you're writing

464
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,700
a game or something that is
really exercising all of the

465
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,520
features of Chrome and really
trying to leverage the GPU and

466
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,720
other things, this is definitely
something that you

467
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,270
want to check out.

468
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,860
And there's a great article
on this on HTML5 Rocks.

469
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,460
But let me show you what
this actually does.

470
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,960
So we can go into
chrome://tracing &mdash;

471
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,210
whoops.

472
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,942

473
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:44,960
Chrome://tracing, we can hit
Record, and let's go to one of

474
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,630
these tabs.

475
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,910
And there we go.

476
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,435
We'll just scroll around for
a little while and go back.

477
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,775
Hit Stop.

478
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:57,190
Now, we have a lot of different
tabs open, so you

479
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,130
see the individual threads of
each tab and how those are

480
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,510
interacting.

481
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,350
But right here, we have
a bunch of activity.

482
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,050
So this is the Renderer
thread.

483
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,990
And we were just scrolling, and
we had that kind of slow

484
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,770
interaction.

485
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,250
So the Renderer was doing
a lot of working here.

486
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,230
And we can actually zoom in
on this region and see.

487
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,465
So this is &mdash;

488
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:17,600
or these are other &mdash; the
specific frames that are being

489
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,340
rendered, and this is the
work that's being done.

490
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,570
So we continue zooming in, we
can pan around, and we can see

491
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,160
the actual work.

492
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,630
So we have a Render widget
that's calling.

493
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,810
So these are internal
names within Chrome.

494
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,760
So if you want to find
out what Chrome is

495
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,150
doing, this is fantastic.

496
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,560
And we can continue zooming in,
and we can see that at a

497
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,170
specific frame here, we're
actually drawing the pattern.

498
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,520
So we're calling a function
within Chrome called Image

499
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,150
Draw Pattern.

500
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,290
And this is what's outputting
those Chrome logos.

501
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,380
But if you want to find out
more as to how that works,

502
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,390
perhaps you're trying to
debug something, that's

503
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,380
the way to do it.

504
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,450
But not only that, this, by
itself, is kind of useful

505
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,030
because you get to peek inside
of Chrome and figure out maybe

506
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,980
you have a performance
bottleneck that you just can't

507
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,720
figure out.

508
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,340
That's the place to figure
out what's happening.

509
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,735
But even better, you can
actually inject your own

510
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:10,170
labels into here to figure out
where is my code and how does

511
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,700
my code interface with
other code within the

512
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,270
internals of Chrome?

513
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,860
So to do that, in your apps, you
can use console.time and

514
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,110
console.timeEnd to mark
a start and an

515
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,260
endpoint for any interval.

516
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,830
And then, in this case,
I'm saying update.

517
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,690
And if we repeated the same
exercise and then zoomed in on

518
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,710
that specific section, we
would actually see these

519
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,230
blocks here &mdash; so update
and render.

520
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,080
So this is your code running
within the context of all the

521
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,920
other code within Chrome.

522
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,680
So if you're really pushing
the performance of the

523
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,130
browser, this is a great way to
get a full picture of not

524
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:49,664
just high-level JavaScript
API.

525
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:53,040
And that will give you access
to CPU-GPU and many, many

526
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,555
other things.

527
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:59,690
So with that, that's all the
tips we had for now.

528
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,610
You can check out the slides,
and I encourage you to do so.

529
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,190
There's a lot of links that you
should explore in there at

530
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,520
bit.ly/devtools-tips.

531
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,770
Thank you.

532
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:34,533
