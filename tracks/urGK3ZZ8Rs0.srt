1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,770

2
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,710
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, guys.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,250
I'm Paul Kinlan, I'm a developer
advocate at Google

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,540
working on Chrome.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,500
I've also worked on the
Web Lab project.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,090
And we're going to talk
about it today.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,400
So I'm with Roger and Mattias.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,150
I keep getting your name
slightly wrong,

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,430
every single time.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,420
So I apologize for this.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,030
Well, yeah anyway, so these are

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,580
engineers from the project.

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,460
You're at B-Reel.

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,210
Try and give yourselves a brief
introduction, to tell

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,020
people what you do.

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,900
ROGER PALA: I'm Roger.

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm a creative technologist at
B-Reel, and I've been the

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,540
technical leader
of the project.

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,130
MATTIAS EKENDAHL:
And I'm Mattias.

20
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm also a creative
technologist, also at B-Reel.

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,900
And I've been mostly focused on
the orchestra, but that's

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,930
for another day.

23
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,960
PAUL KINLAN: So another time.

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,790
I was going to say save the best
for last, but they're all

25
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,970
equally good.

26
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,870
So anyway, today's
experiments.

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,790
You know what, I'll jump
back a little bit.

28
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,745
I'll tell everyone what
Web Lab is case it's

29
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:05,780
your first time here.

30
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,410
So Web Lab is a series of five
real world Chrome experiments

31
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,670
built at the British Science
Museum, but are also

32
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,810
accessible online as well.

33
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,670
So over the past couple of
Hangouts, we talked about some

34
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,580
of the other experiments, and
today we're going to talk

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,340
about Data Tracer.

36
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,850
Do you guys want to give a brief
overview of the Data

37
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,345
Tracer project?

38
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:29,240
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, so it's
a visualization of where

39
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,730
stuff is located on the
internet, and how fast it goes

40
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,620
for you to find it.

41
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,060
It's about finding the images.

42
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,860
ROGER PALA: Yeah, the whole
concept about Web Lab is

43
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,290
revealing kind of
like the inner

44
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,670
workings of the internet.

45
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,740
So there's things that we
usually do on the internet.

46
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,035
Sometimes for example, when
you look for an image in

47
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:57,870
Google search, and it
comes instantly.

48
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,620
Sometimes when it takes a
little bit longer you're

49
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,540
already a bit annoyed
about it.

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,640
And you don't really realize
that what is actually

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,669
happening behind it
is so amazing.

52
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,190
And it's like that is
what is happening.

53
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,420
It goes to a place like very,
very far away and it comes

54
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,890
back to you.

55
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,940
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I think
that's one of the things that

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,310
people on the internet &mdash;
well people on the

57
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,110
internet, the internet!

58
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,960
A lot of people don't understand
how data gets to

59
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,700
the machine that's
on your computer.

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,090
And the thing I like about
this project at least it

61
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,490
literally is the underpinnings
of the internet.

62
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,430
People think you can just go
straight to the machine and

63
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,850
pull it out.

64
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,000
And that doesn't
happen, right.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,130
You don't have a direct
connection.

66
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,940
You have to go through one, two,
three, four, 20 different

67
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,710
hops just get the data back.

68
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,260
20 different machines on
the internet just to

69
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,320
get the data back.

70
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,540
And this is there to help
visualize that.

71
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,330
So this is an experiment, a
physical experiment in the

72
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,120
British Science Museum
and also online.

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,210
Shall we just have
a quick look.

74
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,026
It'd be a pretty boring Hangout
if we didn't have a

75
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:04,155
quick look.

76
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:06,400
And again my common theme.

77
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,130
I love these little animations
I think they're beautiful.

78
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,050
And they were done in Flash
originally and imported

79
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,440
through via Swiffy,

80
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,900
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

81
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,820
PAUL KINLAN: There we go.

82
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,790
So every Hangout you're
going to see is me

83
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,460
talking about this.

84
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,480
[LAUGHS]

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,770
[INAUDIBLE].

86
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,670
So this is the is Data
Tracer project.

87
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,590
Do you want to kind of give us
a little understanding of

88
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,170
what's happening on it?

89
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,345
It's quite visceral.

90
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:25,940
ROGER PALA: Yeah, so here we can
see the beginning of the

91
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,760
generation of the world map that
we use to visualize all

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,050
the trace routes.

93
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,890
It is done in WebGL.

94
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,760
And this map is generated
dynamically.

95
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,000
We used a map from NASA to get
the elevation from each of the

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,210
areas of the world.

97
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,350
And then we tweak it a little
bit because there were some

98
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,950
regions that weren't
looking that nice.

99
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,050
PAUL KINLAN: Quite flat?

100
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,080
ROGER PALA: Yeah
some very flat.

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,650
PAUL KINLAN: I can imagine quite
a lot of places at sea

102
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,690
level where they might look
like the sea, right?

103
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,890
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

104
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,960
We had to do it this kind of
model with the sea as well.

105
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,390
PAUL KINLAN: This actually looks
like some of the games

106
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,410
I've played online quite
a while ago.

107
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,120
They were pretty cool.

108
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,585
Looks actually beautiful.

109
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:14,570
So I mean how does this directly
relate to the real

110
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,399
world experiment
in the museum?

111
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,500
Because there's a model at the
museum isn't there as well?

112
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,490
ROGER PALA: Yeah, so this map
was generated online using a

113
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,210
browser and WebGL.

114
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,660
Basically coding.

115
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:33,570
And then from this 3D model
generated with WebGL, we

116
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,800
generated &mdash;

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,330
we used [INAUDIBLE], basically,
to generate the

118
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,480
real map that we use
in the museum to do

119
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,940
some projection mapping.

120
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,130
PAUL KINLAN: So like the real
world map is based off the

121
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,410
WebGL digital representation
that you made.

122
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,030
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

123
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,940
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

124
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,920
It's a pretty big map, right?

125
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,890
So I take it you printed small,
was it smaller pieces

126
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,090
like little chunks and then kind
of assemble them up or

127
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,210
was it like &mdash; would you build
Australia in one go?

128
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,660
ROGER PALA: I'm not
entirely sure.

129
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,590
This was done by our
partner Tellart.

130
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:04,980
PAUL KINLAN: Tellart.

131
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,820
ROGER PALA: They were in charge
of the instruments in

132
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,350
the museum.

133
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,780
All of the experiments
in the museum.

134
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,250
And I'm not sure, yeah.

135
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,485
PAUL KINLAN: It's pretty cool.

136
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:16,160
I remember seeing &mdash; it's
huge in the museum

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,790
as well, isn't it?

138
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,270
ROGER PALA: It is,
it is very big.

139
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,330
PAUL KINLAN: We can see on the
screen now it's like four &mdash;

140
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,080
this a live stream and it's
relatively late at night so

141
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,720
there's no one there
at the moment.

142
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,570
Yeah, but we have four consoles
where you can kind of

143
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,630
select an image.

144
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,750
I think they're hand-selected
images aren't they, I think?

145
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,050
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

146
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,210
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

147
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,830
PAUL KINLAN: I didn't want
people searching for &mdash;

148
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,787
well, whatever.

149
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:36,070
[LAUGHTER]

150
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,960
ROGER PALA: It's basically the
same experience, but using

151
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,980
this kind of tablet instead
of a computer.

152
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,690
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

153
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,520
So it's all touch sensitive
screens and stuff isn't it?

154
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,980
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

155
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,770
PAUL KINLAN: So let's
scroll back in.

156
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,680
And so this is the actual Web
Lab, the visualization

157
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,970
that we have now.

158
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,110
And as we can see these blue
lines, why are they coming out

159
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,420
of the screen at the moment?

160
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,900
ROGER PALA: These are searches
from users, from other users

161
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,270
at the moment.

162
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,230
And we can see that one
interesting thing is that we

163
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,330
highlight Web Lab on the map.

164
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,890
And this is because how the
tracing works is that it needs

165
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,900
to always go through a server
that is located in the museum.

166
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,450
So when you look for an image
what we are really

167
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,730
tracing is not from &mdash;

168
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,210
so it's not from our location
in the moment.

169
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,730
It's always from the
science museum.

170
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,270
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

171
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,240
I kind of like how it all
seems to go across the

172
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,140
Atlantic into pretty
much New York.

173
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,180
You know, I think is it the
Port Authority building or

174
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,650
something there.

175
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,790
It seemed like in the late 90's
that was one of the most

176
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,720
connected buildings on the
internet, as well.

177
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,360
Pretty crazy.

178
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,480
I like as well how the routes
dart backwards and forwards

179
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,466
across the country and
a lot of the stuff's

180
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,430
based America it seems.

181
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,700
But you don't realize when
you're searching for something

182
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,290
where you're actually getting
the data from and how it

183
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,045
actually travels across.

184
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:58,100
It's pretty cool.

185
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,570
Oh there's an image
as well, nice.

186
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,455
Should we do a little search?

187
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:02,830
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

188
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,630
PAUL KINLAN: What shall
we search for?

189
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,840
Something British?

190
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,350
We haven't prepared
this beforehand.

191
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,960
ROGER PALA: Fish and chips.

192
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,570
PAUL KINLAN: Fish and chips.

193
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,760
That's a really good idea.

194
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,410
Fish and chips.

195
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,940
I'm going to say watch
the results come in.

196
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,190
They'll be the worst
results ever now.

197
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,620

198
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,380
I can't remember which one.

199
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,490
It's the first one,
let's have a look.

200
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,180
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: This is
absolutely not prepared.

201
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,040
PAUL KINLAN: This is absolutely

202
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,240
not prepared, honest.

203
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,030
[LAUGHTER]

204
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,610
PAUL KINLAN: So yeah, something
British we get from

205
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,570
England, and let's see
where the data goes.

206
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,430
It must be somewhere inside
the UK that we're bringing

207
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,870
this image from, right?

208
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,470
This is pretty cool.

209
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,720
So it's tracing the route
of the image.

210
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,225

211
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,220
Oh, interesting.

212
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,120
ROGER PALA: So you can see the
camera following there.

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,750

214
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,160
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It
goes to the States.

215
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,990
PAUL KINLAN: Tempe, El Segundo,
back across to

216
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,530
Herndon there, back
across again.

217
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,520
That's a pretty insane route.

218
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,220
I mean, I think the thing that
for me that this highlights is

219
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,330
that the routing system
is designed to

220
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,180
be resilient, right?

221
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,446
And which means it's not
always optimized

222
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:13,790
for the best path.

223
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,400
The best path route.

224
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,970
This actually might be the
cheapest route, cost per

225
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,260
carrier for instance.

226
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,620
I always remember doing in
like university we'd talk

227
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,140
about how the [? BGP ?] routed
and how all these types of

228
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,990
kind of routing protocols
work.

229
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,450
And you sometimes think it's the
quickest route from A to

230
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,150
B. It's not always, right?

231
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,490
It's like the cheapest
route sometimes.

232
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,870
If you've got a paid connection
with another

233
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,289
provider, you'll send it out
that way because it's cheaper

234
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,440
to send data across that link
than say another link that you

235
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,300
aren't paid with.

236
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,390
I don't know, but we don't
know whether that

237
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,230
happened in this case.

238
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,990
But it's kind of interesting
that it took 0.4 seconds to

239
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,530
get across 16,000 kilometers,
which is pretty cool.

240
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,003
And I kind of looked at the
little stats that you have.

241
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:57,310
Your trace route took 0.42
seconds to reach its

242
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,150
destination.

243
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:04,120
That's 400,000 times faster than
a Formula One car It just

244
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,980
shows you even though we're
separated by this huge expanse

245
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,556
of the world, essentially,
you can actually &mdash;

246
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:13,460
ROGER PALA: Access
data very easily.

247
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,720
Really quickly.

248
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,330
PAUL KINLAN: I always think it's
kind of interesting there

249
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,806
are some like theoretical
limits, there

250
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,200
is a speed of light.

251
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,650
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

252
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,560
PAUL KINLAN: And all this
type of stuff we

253
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,666
can't quite get around.

254
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,180
But let's just turn back.

255
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,783
So we'll zoom out you can kind
of roughly see the path that

256
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:27,033
that was going across.

257
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,400

258
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,180
Yeah I find it kind of
quite interesting.

259
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,880
Some of the stuff that I
find most interesting &mdash;

260
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,410
which I don't know whether
this is kind

261
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,580
of Tellart or not &mdash;

262
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,000
is the traceroute protocol.

263
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We should probably explain
traceroute, shouldn't we?

264
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,340
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

265
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,140
PAUL KINLAN: So a lot of people
watching this are

266
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,510
probably quite technical, and
you probably know about ping

267
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,020
and traceroute, these commands
that you use to assess the

268
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,310
network health essentially.

269
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,930
Ping will normally &mdash;

270
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,160
basically you're saying I need
to ping google.com, and then

271
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,400
it will fire a packet
of data, a piece of

272
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,270
data across to Google.

273
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,580
And if it doesn't reach Google,
it basically says

274
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,390
network unreachable, and you
know there's a problem

275
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,630
somewhere on the internet.

276
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,580
But you don't know
where, right?

277
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,990
You don't know whether it's any
one of those 10 hops to

278
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,520
get to Google, or whether it's
just your connection, or

279
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,120
whether it's the entirety
of Google, or

280
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,720
some other the service &mdash;

281
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,300
I probably can't say
Google too much &mdash;

282
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,496
is down.

283
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:24,820
And then traceroute
is designed to

284
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,660
complement that, right?

285
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,880
Traceroute sends a packet
straight across to your

286
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,613
server, another.com.

287
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:35,240
[LAUGHTER]

288
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,800
PAUL KINLAN: It sends it out
to these different places.

289
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,320
But what it does is, it doesn't
send it straight away.

290
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,980
There's a thing called a
time-to-live value on each

291
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,850
packet of data that you send.

292
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,410
And this is basically to ensure
that the data doesn't &mdash;

293
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,680
we saw it bounce
around, right?

294
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,280
We sent a packet across
to get an image.

295
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,050
And we saw it bounce around
America a couple times before

296
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,660
it actually got to
the image itself.

297
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,750
Now there are some controls
and make sure that packet

298
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,220
doesn't always bounce
around the internet.

299
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,630
It might get stuck in some
weird loop of routing.

300
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,765
If like one router says, send it
that way, and then another

301
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,320
router says, send it back
because that's the cheapest

302
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,660
route to get to the network.

303
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,250
There's like some weird things
going across in the networks.

304
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,940
It's very unlikely for that
to happen, I must say.

305
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,055
But there's a thing called TTL
which is basically on each

306
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:21,085
packet that says how many hops
can each packet make across

307
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,480
the internet.

308
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,180
I can't remember if it's 25.

309
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,140
I don't know what
the default is.

310
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,225
Essentially if it was 25, you
could go through 25 different

311
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:31,620
routers before the packet would
just be discarded, and

312
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,890
said it didn't reach the host.

313
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,670
To cut a really long story
short, traceroute basically

314
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,320
sets TTL to one.

315
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,100
So that the first router it
reaches sends the response

316
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,790
back saying basically,
it reached here.

317
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,590
Which means that you can kind of
see the IP address that it

318
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,880
reached before it got canceled,
essentially.

319
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,775
And then once you have
that packet back, it

320
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:55,210
sets the TTL to two.

321
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,240
So it goes two hops down the
chain of routers, and it goes

322
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,570
out and out and out and out.

323
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,910
The point I'm trying to make is,
that's not accessible in

324
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,570
the browser, right?

325
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,490
So do you know how this
was actually &mdash;

326
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,776
I could have really asked this
question a lot easier.

327
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:09,630
[LAUGHTER]

328
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,370
PAUL KINLAN: I'll have
to give some kind of

329
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,010
[? presentation ?] at least.

330
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,150
So traceroute isn't available
directly in the browser.

331
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,650
Do you know how this
was built?

332
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,080
I hope you do, otherwise &mdash;

333
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,220
[LAUGHTER]

334
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,720
PAUL KINLAN: --otherwise, I
spent 10 minutes talking about

335
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,410
traceroutes.

336
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,470
ROGER PALA: Well, Tellart
did this bit, so we

337
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,910
don't know the details.

338
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:35,330
But I know that they were
using Python, I think.

339
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,940
PAUL KINLAN: So they used
basically a Python server to

340
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,690
simulate traceroute &mdash;

341
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,530
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

342
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,560
PAUL KINLAN: --from everything
that I understand.

343
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,890
So how did you hook that up
into the visualization?

344
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,610
I mean did they do the entire
traceroute and then give you

345
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,170
the data back, or did they
give you kind of

346
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,680
one hop at a time?

347
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,930
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: No,
it's all at once.

348
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,700
PAUL KINLAN: Okay.

349
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,020
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And just
because of cache because it's

350
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,320
a lot of traceroutes going
on and it takes a while.

351
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,840
So if millions of people are
doing it at the same time, it

352
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,350
would get stuck in the system.

353
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,930
So it's the whole thing, and
then it's cached for an hour

354
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,340
or something.

355
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,660
PAUL KINLAN: Which is probably
why fish and chips worked

356
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,120
quite well.

357
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,522
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

358
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:11,950
[LAUGHTER]

359
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,100
PAUL KINLAN: That's cool.

360
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,140
So the point I was going
to say before was, the

361
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,990
visualization themselves, how do
you know where in the world

362
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,960
to plot them?

363
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,825
I mean because on traceroute
we have an IP address, and

364
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,630
that IP address &mdash;

365
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,110
ROGER PALA: So we have a system
to transform this IP

366
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,070
address into latitude and
longitude coordinates.

367
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,180
And then we just easily
place it on the map.

368
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,050
PAUL KINLAN:So you basically
just do a transform, kind of

369
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,930
put it into world coordinates,
from real world coordinates

370
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,240
into model world coordinates,
I suppose.

371
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,420
ROGER PALA: So one of the
reasons that we use the NASA

372
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:54,030
map to generate the 3D map was
because it was easy to place

373
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,200
in the exact location that
we were receiving the

374
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,260
coordinates.

375
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,700
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

376
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,760
Looks really nice.

377
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,200
I kind of like how
small the UK is.

378
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm always amazed by
the size the UK.

379
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,570
Like the entirety of the UK
fits into California.

380
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,290
It's absolutely crazy.

381
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,960
And I could go into a long thing
about why I don't travel

382
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,780
anywhere in the UK.

383
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,820
It takes too long.

384
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,940
And then you go across
America, and

385
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,620
it's absolutely fine.

386
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,180
But I won't.

387
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,750
So that's pretty cool.

388
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,210
So is there anything else that
you want to kind of tell us

389
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,740
about this project?

390
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,040
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's quite
an interesting mix, if you

391
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,000
look at the graphics here.

392
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,290
So we have the map in WebGL
running in the background, and

393
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,490
then the small dots here, and we
saw an image pop up and the

394
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,145
Web Lab is actually in 2D.

395
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:37,950
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so
the image is that

396
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,350
pop-up when you search?

397
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,200
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: In 2D so that
they are interactive as

398
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,610
normal HTML, and we get the nice
font rendering without

399
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,020
doing sprites.

400
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,200
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty cool
because I know, I keep

401
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,350
mentioning Paul Lewis.

402
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,960
Hello Paul.

403
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,130
We do recordings in the studio
sometimes and we're

404
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,730
two Pauls in a pod.

405
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,650
But I was going to say something
interesting.

406
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,550
Well that wasn't it.

407
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,220
We were talking the other day
about kind of aliasing effects

408
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,020
with fonts in WebGL.

409
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,250
Because you can never actually
position it as

410
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,120
accurately as you want.

411
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,000
You can position it accurately
in the scene, but not in user

412
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,650
visible space.

413
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,430
Essentially, it's really
hard to do text.

414
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,240
It's kind of interesting.

415
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,450
I really like it how
everything seems

416
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,190
to go across America.

417
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,930
That's insane.

418
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,750
Yeah, so I think we're probably
done with this one.

419
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,350
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

420
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,040
PAUL KINLAN: So if you like this
experiment, try it out

421
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,470
chromeweblab.com the Data
Tracer experiment.

422
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,630
And also visit the museum, where
it's actually a physical

423
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,120
installation.

424
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,075
Which I'll just double click in
here again, and you'll be

425
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,020
able to see the live stream,
with no one there at the

426
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,436
moment, because it's
late at night.

427
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,320
Yeah, thanks guys for coming
in, by the way.

428
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,540
It's kind of, it is
getting late now.

429
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,630
It's pretty cool.

430
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,970
But yeah, go and see
it at the museum.

431
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,730
And you'll see just how it's
mapped from the real world to

432
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,540
what we know as the digital
world, essentially.

433
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,790
Cool.

434
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:07,400
