PETE LEPAGE: All right.

4
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,080
Well, welcome everybody.

5
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,580
And thanks for joining us for
"Behind the div's," a look at

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,850
FInd Your Way to Oz, one of
the new Chrome experiments

7
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,080
built by Unit9.

8
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,930
My name is Pete LePage.

9
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,980
I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

10
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,830
And today, I'm joined by some
of the guys who built Find

11
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,870
Your Way to Oz from
the Unit9 team.

To my left, I've got
Anrick Bregman.

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,210
To his left, I've got
Yates Buckley.

00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,590
And then, Silvio Paganini, who's
going to show us some of

15
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,610
the cool tech stuff.

16
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,260
If you haven't played with Find
Your Way to Oz, if we

17
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,080
could maybe put that URL
up on screen right now.

18
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,330
It's FindYourWayToOz.com.

19
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,490

20
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,300
And really cool Chrome
experiment.

21
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,270
Really awesome way to go see a
little bit about the movie, to

22
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,990
try and go do some really
neat things.

23
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,340
Why don't you guys tell us a
little bit about some of the

24
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,170
things that users can do when
playing around on the site?

25
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,870
And then, we'll talk about
how we built &mdash;

26
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,830
how you guys &mdash;

27
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,610
built some of these things.

28
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,430
ANRICK BREGMAN: Sure.

29
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,100
The beginning of the project
was really trying to figure

30
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,570
out, how could we tell a story
about this film without

31
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,490
telling the same story
as the film?

32
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,280
Or more, how we could make an
interactive experience that

33
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,950
leads you to the film?

34
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,630
And so very quickly, we began
to focus on the circus and

35
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,620
also, the storm scenes, which
were part of the film.

36
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,240
We watched the film, and we felt
really attracted to those

37
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,485
two sections in the
film experience.

38
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:06,330
And we felt, wow, there's a lot
of stuff that you can do

39
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,630
there that'll be fun
interactively.

40
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,640
And so focusing on the
circus, first of

41
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,610
all, felt very natural.

42
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,570
Very quickly, we became attached
to this line called

43
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,914
Find Your Way to Oz, which
became the main site URL

44
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:21,279
eventually.

45
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,350
And that's really the mission
for the user online.

46
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,840
It's every step of the way,
everything that you do, takes

47
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,110
you one step closer to the
world of Oz on film.

48
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,060
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

49
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,080
ANRICK BREGMAN: And so that
became a really fun

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,960
brainstorm.

51
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
What can you do in a circus?

52
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,750
What are the things, the
attractions, that you

53
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,470
can have fun with?

54
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,950
And how could we infuse those
attractions with characters

55
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,870
from the film?

56
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,170
The first one would be a classic
character cut-out type

57
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,950
experience, which is
adding your face to

58
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,420
the characters' bodies.

59
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,880
Then we came up with a
whole range of ideas.

60
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,890
But we zeroed in on that.

61
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,260
Then, it was really fun for us
to think about a musical

62
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,890
experience.

63
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,470
And also, that was led
by tech as well.

64
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,730
The web audio just felt like a
really fun, natural thing to

65
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,540
play with So a musical
organ became our next

66
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,040
focus, our next idea.

67
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,210
And then finally, we had an idea
to create a movie type

68
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,050
capture attraction.

69
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,070
And that came from the film.

70
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,830
As seen in the film, where
Oscar, who was making his way

71
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,230
to Oz, has a zoetrope
in one of his tents.

72
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,630
In his main tent.

73
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,550
PETE LEPAGE: I think that was
when we were looking at some

74
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,380
of prototypes.

75
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,700
The zoetrope was one of my
favorite things, just to see

76
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,120
that happen in real time
and get built up.

77
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,230
We're going to talk about some
of the prototypes and that

78
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,150
kind of stuff in a sec.

79
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,030
But Silvio, why don't you pop
over to the computer over

80
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,030
there, if you don't mind,
and just sort of

81
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,880
bring up the demo?

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,460
And let's have a look at some
of the things that are going

83
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,940
on within the demo, so that as
we're talking through some of

84
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,220
these things, we can sort of &mdash;

85
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,030
YATES BUCKLEY: The
website demo?

86
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,920
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah,
the website.

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,180
Sorry.

88
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,390
Yes.

90
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:10,730
Yeah.

91
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,773
The other interesting thing was,
while we were developing

92
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:17,360
it, we actually came up with
many different prototypes.

93
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,580
And I think the technology
breadth, in terms of the

94
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,930
exploration phase,
was very wide.

95
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,030
But it was funny, because some
of the things we came up with

96
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,860
maybe were kind of like,
too tech for a

97
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,820
circus for that scenario.

98
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,340
They didn't create that
dreamy space.

99
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,900
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

100
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,480
Well, what's &mdash;

101
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,640
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

102
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,870
Here, we're looking at inside
of one of the scenes.

103
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,640
You see, actually, that the
photo booth and some of the &mdash;

104
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,560
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

105
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,830
So if we go into the
photo booth &mdash;

106
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,440
can we get rid of the URL
on screen right now?

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,980

108
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,996
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah, so this
is the photo booth capture.

109
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:04,220
And there's a really nice
transition into a lens change

110
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,770
there, in the 3D engine.

111
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,390
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

112
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,960
YATES BUCKLEY: Sorry,
I'm looking &mdash;

113
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,190
PETE LEPAGE: So we're looking
at the screen here.

114
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,920
And I know you guys
can't see us.

115
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,340
Unfortunately, there's no camera
on the computer that

116
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,970
we're doing this demo on, so
it makes it a little bit

117
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,930
harder to show this off.

118
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,172
But you can try this
on your own.

119
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:24,250
Does the music box work for &mdash;

120
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,700
would we be able to give
that one a shot?

121
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,050
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

122
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,135
You should be able to
work the music box.

123
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:29,900
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

124
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,240
ANRICK BREGMAN: In all of the
interactions that we had, and

125
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,960
all of the attractions, we had
a really nice mix of very

126
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,732
classic asset switches,
hand-painted textures &mdash;

[CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING]

128
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:43,452
ANRICK BREGMAN: --such as in the
photo booth, and also here

129
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:46,690
in the music box, hand-painted
character textures, combined

130
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,802
with these WebGL models.

131
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,290
And then, the interface on top,
which is something that

132
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,160
allows you to edit and change
what you're seeing.

133
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,100
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

134
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,370
So that's actually a good
transition point as we look at

135
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,886
some of these things.

136
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:05,680
What was building some
of these things like?

137
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,520
Because I remember seeing early
on, we had a whole bunch

138
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,840
of prototypes for some
individual things.

139
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,760
And then we said, OK, well,
we're going to put all these

140
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,950
pieces together.

141
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,070
And Silvio, if you want to come
on back, and we can talk

142
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,340
about some of those things.

143
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,710
What was the process like
to build these out?

144
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,170
What were some of the things
that you guys went through?

145
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,260
I know there's a lot of WebGL
involved in this.

146
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,080
There's a lot of
CSS animations.

147
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,890
There's a whole bunch
of sprite stuff.

148
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,260
What's going on?

149
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,090
How did you build some
of these things?

150
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,370
SILVIO PAGANINI: So basically,
we started prototyping most of

151
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,750
the technology we could
use in Chrome.

152
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,550
And one really interesting
thing to use &mdash;

153
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,120
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

154
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Can we pull up Silvio's
desktop?

155
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,260

156
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,170
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, so
one of the first ones

157
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,750
was the card loading.

158
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,120
So it's all a CSS3 transition.

159
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,570
So here, you can see on the
fly all the values for the

160
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,240
WebKit transform.

161
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,530
So as you hover your mouse,
you're just using the 3D

162
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,960
transformations of it.

163
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,350
I could click and see the other
side of it, which is

164
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,420
basically the whole concept
behind the website, was two

165
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,640
sides of Oz.

166
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,170
That was the first one,
[? this live ?] one here.

167
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,670
We actually have another
prototype for 3D.

168
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,100
Want to show some 3D as well?

169
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,590
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

170
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,130
Yeah, definitely.

171
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,642
SILVIO PAGANINI: So actually,
we can go for the sprite

172
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:35,410
sheets, maybe, for the
high-DPI devices.

173
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,660
So one thing that was quite a
neat, the experience works for

174
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,670
both the normal screens and
the high-DPI screens.

175
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,710
And one way to do this was to
use the sprite sheets and the

176
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,360
new CSS properties for that.

177
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,010
So my screen's not high-DPI, but
we can't see this, but at

178
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,310
least we can see the whole
story about this.

179
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,550
So we can see the sprite sheets
on my machine here.

180
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,730
[? It's probably ?]

181
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:00,830
PNG.

182
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,760
You can't see much.

183
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,420
But all the assets are in one
PNG, and then you just control

184
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,790
them on the DOM.

185
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,440
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

186
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,500
Cool.

187
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,000
So if we can come back
to us for a sec.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,530
One of the things I think is
really fascinating was how you

189
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,160
guys did think through how to
deal with high-DPI screens, as

190
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,960
well as on non-high-DPI
screens.

191
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,620
What challenges did you face
when thinking about that?

192
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,780
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah, I mean,
I think it's sort of an

193
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,120
infrastructure decision.

194
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,840
A lot of things we had to deal
with technologically became

195
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,165
quickly kind of infrastructure
decisions.

196
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,780
Like, how do we set this up so
we don't have to worry about

197
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,410
it later, and that the creative
team can just work

198
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,870
along and not have any bad
surprises later on?

199
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,360
So we were always double
thinking what might

200
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,020
go wrong in a way.

201
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,120
And one of them was
the high-DPI.

202
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,980
Which I think tied really well
with the sprite sheets

203
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,840
application, because then you
can just pick the right asset

204
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,970
on the fly and deal with
these kind of problems.

205
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,930
Yeah, so &mdash;

206
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,710
PETE LEPAGE: Now, are you
sending high-DPI images only

207
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,800
to devices that deserve
them, and lower to--?

208
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,200
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yes.

209
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,755
So basically, we load for
the normal sprite

210
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:19,320
sheet for all devices.

211
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,220
And if we detect that there is
a high-DPI device loading the

212
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,680
website, then we load
the new one.

213
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,690
PETE LEPAGE: And how
did you do that?

214
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,940
What was the mechanism
you used?

215
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,586
SILVIO PAGANINI: If you can show
my screen, there's one

216
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:36,010
[? comment ?] we found out,
which is window dot aspect

217
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,960
ratio device pixel ratio.

218
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,600
And then these would
show the high &mdash;

219
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,350
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

220
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,850
SILVIO PAGANINI: --which
screen &mdash;

221
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,050
PETE LEPAGE: So you
can go through.

222
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,620
OK.

223
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,080
SILVIO PAGANINI: So on a
high-DPI screen, it'll show

224
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,100
here 2 as a result.

225
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,785
And on my screen, of course,
it's showing 1 because I don't

226
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:53,170
have the high-DPI one.

227
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,430
So that's a trick that I used.

228
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,520
PETE LEPAGE: Now were you
checking for the straight up

229
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,200
value of 2?

230
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,985
Or were you checking
for greater than 1?

231
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:01,525
SILVIO PAGANINI:
Greater than 1.

232
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:01,780
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

233
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,650
And that's the right
way to go.

234
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,230
I was dealing with one project
a couple of months ago.

235
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:12,070
And they had assumed that the
device pixel ratio value would

236
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,040
always be a whole number.

237
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,540
And it was like 1.4 or 1.3.

238
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,350
So when they were doing some
math on it, it was

239
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,130
coming down to 1.

240
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,770
And everything just
looked wrong.

241
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,900
We were trying to figure
out what was going on.

242
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,110
And as it turns out, that
was the reason.

243
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,410
So you want to definitely make
sure when you're looking at

244
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,030
that number, be aware, it
might not be 2 or 1.

245
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,180
It might be somewhere
in between.

246
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,660
It might even be higher.

247
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,790
At some point, hopefully we'll
get even higher DPI displays.

248
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,535
SILVIO PAGANINI: At
some point, yeah.

249
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:42,970
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

250
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,010
That would be really
kind of cool.

251
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,500
Cool.

252
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,180
YATES BUCKLEY: I think the thing
I really wanted to show

253
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,720
also &mdash; it kind of falls in with
this idea of the DPI and

254
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,670
trying to handle problems.

255
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,700
If you could throw
the first video.

256
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,880
If you could launch that.

257
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,980
Basically, a lot of the site in
it used a control panel to

258
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,781
control settings that were
critical to the experience.

259
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:05,775
[GUSTING WINDS]

260
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,763
YATES BUCKLEY: And it
was kind of bizarre.

261
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:11,242
The team was a very big
team, actually.

262
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:13,230
[INAUDIBLE].

263
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,320
So it was very difficult with
certain problems you run into

264
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,300
to get everybody to agree on
what's really going on, what

265
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,380
really needs to be done.

266
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,100
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

267
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,680
YATES BUCKLEY: Is that
video up now?

268
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,400
PETE LEPAGE: It just
finished running.

269
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,650
So that's &mdash;

270
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,260

271
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,350
YATES BUCKLEY: Sorry.

272
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,420
The video is the first one?

273
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,740
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

274
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,960
And after we do that, one
thing I do want mention.

275
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,890
For people who are watching
this live, we do have a

276
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,920
moderator queue that you
can ask questions at.

277
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,180
So Paul, when you get a sec, if
we could put the moderator

278
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,980
link up for the questions.

279
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,050
Please post your questions
there, so that we can try and

280
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,230
answer some of your questions
live as we go today.

281
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,090
We've got a computer up here
so that I can see what the

282
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,130
questions coming in are, and
we can go from there.

283
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,490
So it looked like--.

284
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,710
YATES BUCKLEY: So basically, the
story is that to make this

285
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,030
kind of content with a bigger
team, you need to have sort of

286
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,920
a middle ground.

287
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,980
You need to create a middle
ground, which you can use to

288
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,130
tweak values or not and agree
together whether that

289
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,170
particular saturation, or how
strong one particular effect

290
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,290
or another can work together.

291
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,990
Because every part of the team
doesn't necessarily have the

292
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,580
whole picture.

293
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,040
So it was always kind of
iterating through things.

294
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,970
And for everything we created,
we'd create an interface for

295
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,530
it, a live interface that people
could try changing.

296
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,730
So I encourage people &mdash;

297
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,160
I think one of the most fun
aspects of the site is if you

298
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,150
look at the beginning of the
HTML5 Rocks site, is if you

299
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,150
call this site with the bug
equals on and then press

300
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,090
Control I, I think it is, and
then you'll have a drop-down

301
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,000
with all the controls
[INAUDIBLE]

302
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,790
PETE LEPAGE: Oh cool.

303
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,800
YATES BUCKLEY: --being
exposed.

304
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,760
It's sort of fun to discover
what's been &mdash;

305
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,190
ANRICK BREGMAN: Well, it was
amazing for the team, because

306
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,630
we had a lot of distance
between everybody.

307
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,690
Not just geographically, but
also in terms of, let's say,

308
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,840
the expertise that
everybody has.

309
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,760
So a WebGL 3D team might not
necessarily get too involved

310
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,740
with the hand-painted skies
that we were making.

311
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,210
And for that to be a kind of
feedback loop between those

312
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,450
teams constantly, trying to
adjust and perfect things,

313
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,850
kind of didn't make sense.

314
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,720
It felt better for everybody to
be able to get their part

315
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,730
of the whole piece perfect first
before integrating it

316
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,630
with the greater project.

317
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,530
So it was a very smart way to
give everybody control of what

318
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,910
they were making and to share
very quickly the kind of

319
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,880
perfect settings from
everybody's perspective.

320
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,020
And then in the end, there's a
process of choosing one of the

321
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,920
several options.

322
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,230
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

323
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,790
ANRICK BREGMAN: But that makes
it a fun process rather than a

324
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,795
very stressful one.

325
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:50,220
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

326
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,600
And by being able to give
everybody that opportunity to

327
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,170
play and experiment on their
own, they really have that,

328
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,620
like, I can feel how my
value's going in.

329
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,810
And then when we talk about it
as a team, we can really &mdash;

330
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,850
YATES BUCKLEY: Exaclty.

331
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,540
ANRICK BREGMAN: And most
importantly, you can be wrong.

332
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,620
Because it's obviously very
frustrating if you say, oh,

333
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,340
let's make it a 2, and then
it's actually 2 point &mdash;

334
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,750
oh, no, no.

335
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,180
Let's make it 2.5.

336
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,290
Oh no.

337
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,170
Actually, let's make it 1.5.

338
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,430
That becomes very stressful if
that loop goes through the

339
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,030
whole team and it takes
people's time.

340
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,905
If it's you yourself,
you can experiment.

341
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:18,190
You can play.

342
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,920
You can go wrong.

343
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,130
You can go back.

344
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,760
But only when you're
comfortable, you can share.

345
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,680
So that's a detail.

346
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,480
It just makes sense.

347
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,920
It just makes it easier and more
fun for the whole team.

348
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,110
PETE LEPAGE: Speaking of the
team, how big was the team who

349
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,890
worked on this?

350
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,710
YATES BUCKLEY: It
was quite big.

351
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,170
I mean &mdash;

352
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,450
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, we
got probably 30 people.

353
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,370
YATES BUCKLEY: We had this Skype
chat open with, it was

354
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,160
like, maybe about 12 people
on it at any one time.

355
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,610
And it's been going
on for months.

356
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,730
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, wow.

357
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,080
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, we
have different chats.

358
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,530
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

359
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,660
We have different
chats as well.

360
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,180
But there's one main one,
which is the main.

361
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,080
There's a lot of people and a
lot of specialists that are

362
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,680
doing very particular work that
nobody else understands.

363
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:55,860
So it's like &mdash;

364
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,710
PETE LEPAGE: And you guys were
also really distributed as

365
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,490
well, weren't you?

366
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:58,690
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

367
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,430
PETE LEPAGE: So where was &mdash;

368
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,975
YATES BUCKLEY: So the back-end
team is in Poland.

369
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,116
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah.

370
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:04,810
We have the back-end
team in Poland &mdash;

371
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,650
YATES BUCKLEY: 3D in Florence.

372
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,010
SILVIO PAGANINI: --which
was very &mdash;

373
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,990
and doing back-end and mobile.

374
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,349
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

375
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,290
Back-end and mobile.

376
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,324
SILVIO PAGANINI: And then we
have the guys in Florence that

377
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:11,580
are doing the 3D.

378
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,196
PETE LEPAGE: Wow.

379
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:14,970
SILVIO PAGANINI: We
had the guys in

380
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,640
Stockholm doing the designs.

381
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,609
We had the guy in Barcelona.

382
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,513
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

383
00:17:20,513 --> 00:17:21,310
SILVIO PAGANINI: The
team in London.

384
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,440
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

385
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,650
I think that's the main &mdash;

386
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,859
SILVIO PAGANINI: That's
the main thing.

387
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,790
Yeah.

388
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,629
ANRICK BREGMAN: And there
were a few other extra

389
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,090
bits here and there.

390
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,490
It's sort of a lot of
specialists who come on board

391
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,170
for a certain time, then
somebody else takes over, and

392
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,090
then the first team comes
back and makes changes.

393
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,720
And it's a really nice back
and forth that way.

394
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,670
But everybody was very engaged
in a way that distance starts

395
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,590
to fall away when people are
really passionate about what

396
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,950
they're making.

397
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,840
And when it seems to work, when
you sort of feel like

398
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,670
there's constantly progress,
everyone becomes very engaged

399
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,940
in spite of the distance.

400
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,580
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

401
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Yeah.

402
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,270
Beyond some of the CSS Sprite
things, let's sort of pop over

403
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,860
to talk about some of
the WebGL stuff.

404
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,450
Because this is such a beautiful
WebGL experience.

405
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:07,700
Right?

406
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,250
Like it really does take full
advantage of the GPU to just

407
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,060
create real moving stuff.

408
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,870
I think when we were talking
earlier Anrick, you were

409
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,690
talking about how just all of
the scenes are hand painted.

410
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,050
And being able to get that
stuff in is just

411
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,130
such an art form now.

412
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,210
And going to there is
pretty phenomenal.

413
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,910
So why don't talk a little bit
about how that process worked.

414
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,540
And I think we talked earlier
about maybe doing a &mdash;

415
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,790
let's have a look at this one.

416
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,645
If we can switch to the laptop
up here for a sec.

417
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:43,230

418
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,590
So do you want to tell
us what this is?

419
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,900
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah.

420
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,070
So basically, that was one of
the early prototypes we'd done

421
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,230
with the whole elements of the
scene plugged in from the 3D.

422
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,730
And that was just to see how the
camera movement would be

423
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,690
on the environment, while
deciding and see how many

424
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,320
objects it would load on real
time for the WebGL to handle.

425
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,780
So it was one of the first and
most effective ways to see how

426
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,510
WebGL was going to perform
in every single machine.

427
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,872
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

428
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:14,490
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

429
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,210
Then we went through
iterations.

430
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,380
We had to establish a
pipeline for the 3D.

431
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,690
That was a very early critical
aspect to the whole project,

432
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,930
because the particular &mdash;

433
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,000
basically, it's still early
days in some of these

434
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,730
technologies.

435
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:36,710
And so setting up a good
pipeline for WebGL, it's

436
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,655
something we hadn't
really dealt with

437
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:39,870
at this scale before.

438
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,420
And so, it was a bit of
tooling that went on

439
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:42,940
beforehand.

440
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,150
We had to convert some tools we
had before to try to figure

441
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,190
out how to support things
like bones animations,

442
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,170
this kind of stuff.

443
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,420
PETE LEPAGE: Now what are
bones animations?

444
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,990
YATES BUCKLEY: It means that
rather than animating every

445
00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:00,760
point, say, of a joint that's
animated, you can animate the

446
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,390
angle basically &mdash; the change
in angle of one item.

447
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,530
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, OK.

448
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,700
YATES BUCKLEY: So basically,
it saves a lot of space.

449
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,340
And it also allows you a more
intuitive control of the scene

450
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,900
in that sense.

451
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,800
And you'll see that in the
balloon at the end.

452
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,500
The balloon is bending
in a way.

453
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,490
It goes through the wind.

454
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,170
That's run by this
bone system, that

455
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,420
isn't by default supported.

456
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,550
It's something that
we had to create.

457
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,070
And then on HTML5 Rocks site,
we've sort of focused on &mdash;

458
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,790
wind was a very important theme
of the whole site, so we

459
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,810
focused on what we did to
create the wind effect.

460
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,360
And if you go to HTML5 Rock's
demo site, there was a number

461
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,000
of prototypes, one of them we're
showing here, in which

462
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,140
you see how this noise
field is generating

463
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,825
this kind of mutation &mdash;

464
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:52,492

465
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:56,460
it's actually a vertex shader
that we're changing the

466
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,260
position of and modifying.

467
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,550
And again, you have all these
settings open again, so that

468
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,970
we can figure out the detail.

469
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,220
And the particles floating
around, as well, are affected

470
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,290
by the same kind of flowing
field beneath it.

471
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,812
SILVIO PAGANINI: Maybe just
show this thing here.

472
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:13,716
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

473
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:15,690
If we could just pop over to
the screen for one sec.

474
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:15,946
YATES BUCKLEY: Oh, OK.

475
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,370
I thought it was on screen.

476
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,065
Yeah, I think that is the demo
from the HTML5 Rocks &mdash;

477
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,325
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, that's
the complete demo.

478
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,120
YATES BUCKLEY: That's
the complete demo.

479
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,380
And we encourage
to look at it.

480
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,640
It's not too complex
of a scene.

481
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,380
And I think it's quite fun,
actually, because you've got

482
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,320
everything in it and
all the controls.

483
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,660
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah.

484
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,786
You can play around with the
controls the same way you play

485
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:37,580
with the website.

486
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,680
So, we tried to do a seamless
transition for everyone to

487
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,980
understand the tools we're using
throughout the whole

488
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,370
website development.

489
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,110
PETE LEPAGE: So what were the
tools you were using?

490
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,160
Like, I'm not a WebGL
kind of guy.

491
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,900
I never got into it.

492
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,240
And it sort of often
went over my head.

493
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,230
So how did you start?

494
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,210
What was the process
for building this?

495
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,476
YATES BUCKLEY: What
we needed to do.

496
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:59,390
This pipeline basically means,
OK, we had to find out in the

497
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:05,840
very early days what kind of
creative input could we get to

498
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,550
create the 3D world and
the WebGL world.

499
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,770
So we actually went back and
tried to convert a tool that

500
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,680
we had created before.

501
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,480
It was a Flash-based tool.

502
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,350

503
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,940
And we converted that to
be able to support

504
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,870
the converting models.

505
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,030
Basically, animations and models
from Maya, then were &mdash;

506
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,660
you could just go through it and
convert them into a scene.

507
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,100
But it had to be read in a
particular way, et cetera.

508
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,660
But once we did that, then it
was a matter of honing the

509
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,510
different effects.

510
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,360
So I think in a way, we were
in parallel working on

511
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,195
optimizing a scene, and the
shaders that we had to &mdash;

512
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:47,300
so, figuring out different
shaders for very particular

513
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,035
effects, whether it's a
particularl lighting effect,

514
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:54,090
or a particular like the god
rays, or we have a nice demo

515
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,090
for the lighting.

516
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,925
I don't know if you could
actually show that.

517
00:22:58,925 --> 00:22:59,940
Do you have that one?

518
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,285
OK.

519
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:00,630
SILVIO PAGANINI: No.

520
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,610
YATES BUCKLEY: No, OK.

521
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:06,380
Anyhow, and including one of
the shaders for the storm

522
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,280
sequence, which is this sort of
twirling tornado, which &mdash;

523
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,430
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

524
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,090
If we could pull up
that for one sec &mdash;

525
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,736
YATES BUCKLEY: --has a strange
history to it kind

526
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:13,720
of thing, in a way.

527
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,330
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

528
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,350
Do you want to tell us a
little bit about that?

529
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,960
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

530
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,690
We went through many iterations
of different models

531
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,640
to try &mdash; oh, gosh.

532
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,840
I lost it.

533
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,810
ANRICK BREGMAN: It was
initially a nice

534
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,820
idea to do a storm.

535
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,540
And we felt very drawn
to the storm.

536
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,090
And it became very quickly a
case of, OK, so how on Earth

537
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,620
are we going to make
this exciting,

538
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,940
intense, but also beautiful?

539
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,730
And how are we going to
make it interactive?

540
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,450
It was a big challenge.

541
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,800
Plus, in the browser
dynamically

542
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,590
rendered as you go.

543
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,440
And so after a few interesting
demos and experiments, we

544
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,370
ended up with a shader
approach.

545
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,780
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah,
so it was all this.

546
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,050
And I'm also studying
neuroscience,

547
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,110
actually, in parallel.

548
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,420
And we've been working on some
games for getting &mdash; basically,

549
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,780
the idea is that people could
help us trace connectivity

550
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,360
between brain cells.

551
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,220
And as part of that research &mdash;
which is not live yet, but I'd

552
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,010
encourage people if they're
interested to go to

553
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,630
brainflight.org and register
to keep updated on it &mdash;

554
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,270
one of the things we did is we
created a viewer that shows

555
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,670
the inside a brain
cell, basically.

556
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,810
You could navigate
through that.

557
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,260
We have a clip of it
that we could show.

558
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,010
PETE LEPAGE: That's the brain?

559
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,370
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

560
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,300
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

561
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,940
YATES BUCKLEY: So this is like
very, very, very small.

562
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,820
What you're looking through,
it's something like, I think

563
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,260
it's about 40 or 50 nanometers,
which is very,

564
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,940
very small.

565
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,080
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, wow.

566
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,260
YATES BUCKLEY: And you're going
through a connection

567
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,250
between one brain cell
and another.

568
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,640
And the problem is that there's
so many of them, it's

569
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,550
not obvious how we're going to
get the manpower to actually

570
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,140
trace the connections.

571
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,455
This is why the idea is maybe
make a game or something, get

572
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:50,720
people to help us.

573
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,410
But we started from
that, and we tried

574
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,750
adding a twist, actually.

575
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,130
Because it looked a little
bit like a tornado.

576
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,000
It looked like the funnel
of a tornado.

577
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,410
So we added a transformation,
like a twist to it, and added

578
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,030
some noise to it.

579
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,600
And something came out that
was very tornado-like.

580
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,230
So what then we just had to
figure out is how to give it

581
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,290
this wispy kind of
effect on it.

582
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,360
And that was done just basically
by evaluating it

583
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,150
multiple times and mixing
these together.

584
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,470
And then once you made that
tornado, which we showed

585
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,850
earlier in terms of that kind
of &mdash; we then had to get it

586
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,640
inside the scene.

587
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,130
And then, you could probably,
if you can, switch to this

588
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,830
machine here, we have a
picture of the tornado

589
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,302
overlapped with the Tokyo
Shibuya background that we

590
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:35,260
grabbed from somewhere.

591
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,210
So here, you see the tornado
just kind of on top of the

592
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,000
scene in the background.

593
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,840
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

594
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,070
YATES BUCKLEY: And to create the
storm sequence, basically,

595
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,530
there are many layers
like this.

596
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,460
There is a background, and there
are, like, drops on the

597
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,810
front screen.

598
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,640
SILVIO PAGANINI: Some clouds.

599
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,810
YATES BUCKLEY: There's clouds.

600
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,590
And they're all different
techniques, actually.

601
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,630
So the clouds are a
particle-based system.

602
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,270
The clouds are low-hanging.

603
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,510
While the tornadoes
is custom shader.

604
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,070
The balloon is a layer that's
just for the balloon.

605
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,800
It's very complicated to handle
the balloon correctly

606
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,820
when it goes into the tornado,
for example.

607
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,500

608
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,660
Or for example, at one point,
we had to give the feeling

609
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,900
that you're being sucked
up into the

610
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,020
whirlwind of the tornado.

611
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,830
And we couldn't do that because
of the way the scene

612
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,370
was structured.

613
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,000
So what we had do was rotate the
world around the camera,

614
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,950
rather than you rotate
the camera.

615
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,320
Because a lot of the objects
we had were flat.

616
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,976
So the background rotates at a
certain point, and it gives

617
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:39,525
you that feeling of you being
taken up into this space.

618
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:39,820
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

619
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,340
ANRICK BREGMAN: It's a very
nice mix of very new

620
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,680
techniques and very classic
techniques, very classic

621
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,980
filmmaking techniques.

622
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,060
Lighting and matte paintings in
the background, layered up

623
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,920
with this very interesting
custom shading.

624
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,240
And what I find amazing,
especially, is how, for

625
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,080
example, the classic
matte painting

626
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,790
mixes with the shading.

627
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,470
It's something that's quite
surprising, because the

628
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,620
shaders are always changing.

629
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,415
And so the background matte
painting is static, but the

630
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,580
shader is constantly changing
the visual.

631
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,870
PETE LEPAGE: That's
really cool.

632
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,970
Well, there's a couple of
questions up in the moderator

633
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,150
queue that I want to take
a look at and get

634
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,700
your opinion on.

635
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,350
So the first question is
from somebody in Italy.

636
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,590
And they want to know, do you
think that WebGL is going to

637
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,580
affect a lot of the
future of the web?

638
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,980
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yes,
definitely.

639
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,450
YATES BUCKLEY: I have
an opinion.

640
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah, go ahead.

641
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,443
SILVIO PAGANINI: I think so.

642
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:32,592
I mean, as long as Chrome and
the other browsers are trying

643
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:34,340
to push this WebGL.

644
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,850
The performance that I can
get here is amazing.

645
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,530
Like the tornado scene, for
example, is the lightest scene

646
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,380
we have on our website.

647
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,760
So if you enter the website,
the first carnival scene is

648
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,705
pretty heavy.

649
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,710
My machine's really struggling
to keep up.

650
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,110
And the tornado itself is
a main shader thing.

651
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,920
And it's really heavy.

652
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,950
You don't see any of the &mdash;
the fan is running crazy.

653
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,720
So I do think in the near
future, the WebGL is going to

654
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
be a nice thing to do.

655
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,320
YATES BUCKLEY: I mean, I think
the thing that's the

656
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,540
interesting story is the
relationship between the

657
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,350
high-DPI devices and 3D tech.

658
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,480
Because when you're making game
design, for example, if

659
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,740
you make it in 3D, then
you don't have to

660
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,330
worry about this issue.

661
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,310
And you don't have to worry
about the aspect ratio of the

662
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,220
phone so much or the device,
because you can just to

663
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,270
reposition the camera in one way
or another and manage to

664
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,410
make an experience that people
feel natural with.

665
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,250
And I think that's a big driver
towards that kind of

666
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,790
technology [? and doctrine. ?]

667
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,100
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

668
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,290
Cool.

669
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,800
Yeah, well, somebody from Zurich
wants to know, what was

670
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,940
the most difficult part?

671
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,760
Was there a point where you
had to change the plan in

672
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,610
order to comply with the
technical possibilities?

673
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,040
I think I know the
answer to this.

674
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,660
But I'll let you
guys sort of &mdash;

675
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,930
YATES BUCKLEY: There
were many parts.

676
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,560
It was full of decisions.

677
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,360
ANRICK BREGMAN: It was
a rollercoaster ride.

678
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,690
It was absolutely a
rollercoaster ride.

679
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,740
PETE LEPAGE: And I think that's
part of the point of a

680
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,180
Chrome experiment.

681
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,770
With a Chrome experiment,
you're pushing the web.

682
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,270
You're doing things that have
never been done before.

683
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,350
You're taking the browser
to its limit.

684
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,150
And there are always going to
be those places where you're

685
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,613
like, and we just fell
over the edge.

686
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:12,563
Whoops.

687
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:13,530
ANRICK BREGMAN: You
got to go back.

688
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,400
PETE LEPAGE: You got to pull
back a little, or maybe

689
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,300
rethink, or sometimes,
hopefully, you can get a

690
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,590
browser bug fixed.

691
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,720
ANRICK BREGMAN: I think the
storm was probably the

692
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,240
trickiest to realize.

693
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,980
We were pretty ambitious about
making a storm that felt as

694
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,580
beautiful and intense as
the one in the film.

695
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,250
Obviously, that story
is different.

696
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,450
But we wanted it to live
up to the film.

697
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,580
And I think there were a few
points where we thought, well,

698
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,640
we're not going to manage.

699
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,600
And I can imagine Yates at home
on the weekend working on

700
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,940
brainflight.org and having a
kind of epiphany moment going,

701
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,560
wait a minute.

702
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,860
This mouse brain looks
just like a storm.

703
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,895
And he came into the office and
said, OK, whatever you're

704
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:51,540
doing with the storm, stop it.

705
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,780
It's not going to work.

706
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,270
We're going in a different
direction.

707
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,736
So that was a key moment, I
think, where we turned the

708
00:29:56,736 --> 00:29:58,110
storm around.

709
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,660
And there was a vision of
something that didn't &mdash;

710
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,690
well, it looked like
a mouse brain.

711
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,710
But we were going to
make it a storm.

712
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,530
And we had a mission,
and it worked out.

713
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,330
It was a big risk, but
it worked out.

714
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,590
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

715
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,220
Well, we've got another
question here

716
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,990
from someone who wants &mdash;

717
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,380
I guess they were looking at the
optimization and wanted to

718
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,860
know why you didn't go with the
WebP image format instead

719
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:27,340
of PNG, since WebP can be up
to almost 25%, 26% smaller.

720
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,690
SILVIO PAGANINI: The only reason
I didn't use it is

721
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,530
because we did not have a fall
back on the CSS for the

722
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,210
[INAUDIBLE] images.

723
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,510
One other thing we did see for
the optimizations is, if you

724
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,060
look at the timeline on Chrome,
every time I apply a

725
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,090
style to a DOM element, you're
at peak of memory usage.

726
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,130
So if you don't have an
immediate fall back on CSS for

727
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,720
all the images, you [? inject ?]
the CSS for the

728
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,790
image on the element.

729
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,110
So this would be like a
massive problem for

730
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,870
performances.

731
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,220
So that's the main reason.

732
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,100
Because this runs in other
browsers as well, so we try to

733
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,590
make it as &mdash;

734
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,360
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

735
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,680
Yeah.

736
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,810
I think that's one ask that
I would have for other web

737
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,610
developers out there, is demand
WebP support out of

738
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,710
your browser.

739
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,080
Right?

740
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,540
Whether it's Firefox,
whether it's

741
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,430
Opera, IE, Safari, whatever.

742
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,610
We need more people
to support this.

743
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,530
And we need the other browser
vendors to step up.

744
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,870
And as web developers, I think
it's our job to go and say to

745
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,800
the web browser vendors,
we want this.

746
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,110
Give it to us.

747
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,680
SILVIO PAGANINI: Even though
they don't give us, at least

748
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,310
the fall back [INAUDIBLE].

749
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,350
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

750
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,990
Or give us a good way to be
able to have a fall back.

751
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,060
Something to that effect.

752
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,900
Absolutely.

753
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,150
Absolutely.

754
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,010

755
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,960
So that's the end of the
questions that up out there

756
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,600
that people have posted.

757
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,950
I'll leave that list
up for a second.

758
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,030
But I just want to talk a little
bit about you guys.

759
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,680
So you guys are Unit9.

760
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,060
You do projects like this.

761
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,960
Do you want to tell a little bit
more about Unit9, some fun

762
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,680
things you guys do?

763
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,840
YATES BUCKLEY: This is probably
the peak of the

764
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,430
excitement in terms
of the jobs we do.

765
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:08,990
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

766
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,540
YATES BUCKLEY: I mean, to have
the client come in and say, we

767
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,280
want you to make an experiment
for us, is just like

768
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,802
a dream come true.

769
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:20,110
It's like, OK, we're going to
go totally crazy here and do

770
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,640
everything we never dared
do in other situations.

771
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,450
But yeah, we do this kind of
thing and these kind of jobs.

772
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,560
And yeah, I've have been
doing it for a while.

773
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,200
We like to work in
a very open way.

774
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,670
You can find a full credit list
of everybody that worked

775
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,280
on this job, every name.

776
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,890
If you go to the site,
it's on there.

777
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,320
We're very open about other
collaborations.

778
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,730
This job wouldn't have been
possible without support from

779
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,080
another other key partners
in this job.

780
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,970
And so yeah.

781
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,790
We believe in that video game
model, where you just get the

782
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,010
best people together and
do the best job.

783
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,360
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

784
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,920
What's the website
for you guys?

785
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,670
YATES BUCKLEY: Unit9.com.

786
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,770
PETE LEPAGE: Unit9.com So nice
and easy to remember.

787
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,590
One of the things that I also
want to call out is you guys

788
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:07,600
wrote a phenomenal HTML5
Rocks tutorial &mdash;

789
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,610
well, I guess it's more
of a case study.

790
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,940
But it went through how you
built a lot of these things.

791
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,430
There's great code samples.

792
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,110
There's a couple of things that
people can go in and play

793
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,800
with, diving deep into
this kind of stuff.

794
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,020
So definitely check that out.

795
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,280
It's up on html5rocks.com.

796
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,900
You can go see that there.

797
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,110
YATES BUCKLEY: Yeah.

798
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,190
It's been very successful
as well.

799
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,060
I really recommend it.

800
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,040
We made an effort to pick out
and make prototypes that you

801
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,030
can chew on, so that you don't
have to get the whole code

802
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,320
base, and still can
have some fun.

803
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,610
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah, if you
have a look on Google Code,

804
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,590
there's the full code for
everything as well.

805
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,894
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, phenomenal.

806
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,510
Oh, cool.

807
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,490
SILVIO PAGANINI: And the we have
the prototype codes for

808
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,010
everything there as well.

809
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,630
So just go and &mdash;

810
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,790
YATES BUCKLEY: Plenty
to look at.

811
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,710
PETE LEPAGE: So if somebody were
to pull that down, could

812
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,130
they just upload it to their own
little server and get it

813
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,000
running reasonably well?

814
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,540
All right.

815
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:56,820
SILVIO PAGANINI: Yeah.

816
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,220
The whole website's just
coded in CoffeeScript.

817
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,020
So also, there's a Cakefile
which compiles

818
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,290
the whole thing up.

819
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,220
PETE LEPAGE: Sweet.

820
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,680
All right.

821
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,400
And you're hosting
it on App Engine?

822
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,650
SILVIO PAGANINI: App
Engine, yes.

823
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,139
YATES BUCKLEY: The App
Engine code is not

824
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,199
currently up there.

825
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,040
I think for security reasons,
we're sort of waiting on that.

826
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,850
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, there's
some of the

827
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,190
back-end stuff is &mdash;

828
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,030
YATES BUCKLEY: But otherwise,
yeah, everything's there.

829
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,590
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

830
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,090
Well, I think that's about all
we have time for today.

831
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,790
We're just at about 30
minutes, 35 minutes.

832
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,250
I want to thank you guys
for coming in.

833
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,730
It was a really great
opportunity to learn a little

834
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,690
bit more about this.

835
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,380
I hope you guys watching live
learned something new and

836
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,429
enjoyed it.

837
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:34,880
Definitely go check the site out
at findyourwaytooz.com It

838
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,630
also works &mdash; we didn't dive into
this at all today, but

839
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,429
the mobile experience
is pretty slick.

840
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:42,830
I can pull it up on a phone or
tablet, whether it's an iPad

841
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,050
or whether it's a Nexus device,
an Android device.

842
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,250
So definitely go
check that out.

843
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,120
You can try it in Chrome
for Android.

844
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,340
You can try it in a couple
other things.

845
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,460
So thank you, gentlemen.

846
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,420
And thank you guys
for joining us.

847
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,560
I hope you enjoyed it.

848
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,280
And we'll talk to
you real soon.

849
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,800
Bye bye.

850
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,050
Thank you.

851
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:37,652
