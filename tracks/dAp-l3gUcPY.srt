1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,340

2
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,190
MALE SPEAKER 1: Shanghai GDG
is a very interesting

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,160
developer community.

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,000
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,240
has asked this question.

6
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,353
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is where
the magic happens.

7
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:08,730
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: This is
primarily a question and

8
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,570
answer show, so if any
of you out there

9
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,820
would like to ask questions.

10
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,620

11
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,370
COLT MCANLIS: Hello.

12
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:17,650
Hello.

13
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,580
I'm live?

14
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,640
Fantastic, awesome.

15
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,280
They're telling me I'm live,
so hello everyone.

16
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,680
Welcome.

17
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,330
Thank you so much for coming
to our GDL session, talking

18
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,560
about webify your game.

19
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,100
I am your host for the day.

20
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,850
My name is Colt McAnlis, and I'm
a developer advocate here

21
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,950
working at Google, focusing
on web gaming.

22
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,680
What I want to talk to you guys
about today, I want to

23
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,400
take about 30 minutes of your
time, 30 to 45 minutes, and

24
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,620
talk about how you can make
more successful games, and

25
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,180
what you need to be doing in
this ecosystem that we have in

26
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,780
order to prosper.

27
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,990
I think to understand that, we
need to take a step back.

28
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,540
We need to go all the way back
to 2009 and take a look at the

29
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,440
gaming ecosystem at that time.

30
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
In 2009, two major
things happened.

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,000
Number one was the rise
of web social gaming.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,040
We saw a lot of social
distributed gaming coming

33
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,580
through the cloud, coming
through these viral networks,

34
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,640
being able to tap a new
generation, a new bucket of

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,530
customers that typically weren't
considered gamers.

36
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,920
These weren't people that big
gaming companies were

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,790
advertising to, or even thought
that there was a

38
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,000
market there.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,850
Number two that happened in 2009
was that we finally saw

40
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,570
the boom of the mobile gaming.

41
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,900
Now the mobile ecosystem had
been there for a number of

42
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,110
years, but really didn't
come into its

43
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,660
stride until about 2009.

44
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,190
Now, the rise of these two
things brought something to

45
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,140
game development the no one
had really seen before.

46
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,660
And that was that any game
developer could go out and

47
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,490
make a very small budget game
and get it in front of

48
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,430
millions of people.

49
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,720
When you have this vacuum that
was created for demand, of

50
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,610
individuals wanting content both
in the social game space

51
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,910
as well as the mobile space, it
gave rise to something that

52
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,660
none of us really expected
at the time.

53
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,370
But it really generated the
indie game developer.

54
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,990
And this is a situation where
you have sort of the casual

55
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,300
development space of just
making websites, or easy

56
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,420
scripting, or people who come
to the table wanting small

57
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,890
content, coupled with sort of
the high-precision, high

58
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,750
frequency game development
processes that we'd seen in

59
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,600
AAA development, as well as
skill sets that had come to

60
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,890
the world for mobile handheld
development that we've seen

61
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,630
from other large publishers.

62
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,570
And this really gave rise to
this developer who basically

63
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,570
became our fan icon for the
games industry overnight.

64
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,960
It seemed like we were flooded
with tons and tons of stories

65
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,210
about how individuals would
spend the weekend in the

66
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,940
garage making a game, and
putting it up on the web or

67
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,690
mobile, and then turning around
and making $100,000 on

68
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,830
it in the next week.

69
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,940
And this type of information,
when received by the general

70
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,950
populace of game developers,
created what I like to call

71
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,540
the modern gaming gold rush.

72
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,070
We had tons and tons and tons
of developers leaving their

73
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,170
established companies with
401(k)s and stock options,

74
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,220
branching out into the
world of unknown self

75
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,140
entrepreneurship, looking to
make the next big game.

76
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,740
And a lot of them actually had
a very, very good success.

77
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,720
Now over time, though, we have
to come to the conclusion that

78
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,850
it's no longer 2009.

79
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,320
In fact, it's 2012 now, and
a lot of the things that

80
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,230
happened back then are
no longer the case.

81
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,850
First off, a lot of these social
games in the social

82
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,070
networks have kind
of taken a fall.

83
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,610
What we've seen is that the
social networks themselves

84
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,780
have reduced a lot of the
sharing and viral features

85
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,190
that originally made those first
generation of games so

86
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,800
successful and so popular.

87
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,430
It was very easy for them to
basically flood your stream of

88
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,660
information with, buy my pink
cow, buy my pink cow.

89
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,350
In addition to that, because of
the early success, we saw a

90
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,650
huge influence and a huge pool
of money come in from venture

91
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,970
capitalists and other small
game development studios,

92
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,270
which effectively just
flooded the space.

93
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,790
There's tons of clones, tons of
one-offs, everyone trying

94
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,340
to do the same thing with a
different skin to kind of keep

95
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,370
your eyeballs and get
your attention

96
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,910
through their clicks.

97
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,670
On the other side of the
dime is mobile gaming.

98
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,220
Now what mobile gaming
has done now &mdash;

99
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,260
don't get me wrong,
mobile gaming is

100
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,650
doing amazingly well.

101
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,930
In fact, I think the latest
statistics still show like

102
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,209
some 27 billion million umpteen
zillion devices that

103
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,530
are released and activated
every day.

104
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,260
But what we're seeing there
is that the market and the

105
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,720
ecosystem has been driven more
by indie game developers than

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,970
any other ecosystem.

107
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,900
And the result there has been
just a flood of content, just

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,970
an overwhelming number of
applications that have ended

109
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,880
up in that ecosystem.

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,680
And the result has kind of been
difficult, because large

111
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,780
game developers, publishers who
traditionally weren't in

112
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,960
the space before, have now
entered into the space, and

113
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,200
are competing against these
indies for the same little 128

114
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,590
pixels by 96 pixel screen real
estate in the promotional

115
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,670
systems that are there.

116
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,800
So the indies are coming to the
table with lots of great

117
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,050
ideas and having to fight
against people with lots of

118
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,970
marketing dollars.

119
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,840
Which means something very
interesting, is that with the

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,790
birth of everything that
happened in 2009, it's never

121
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,450
been easier or more
cost-effective to make a game

122
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,690
and get it in front of
millions of people.

123
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,950
The problem though, is it's
still just as hard to market

124
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,820
that game and actually convince
all the people in the

125
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,010
crowd that your content
is worth looking at.

126
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,590
So what we end up with, is you
have a whole fleet of indie

127
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,700
developers all making content,
expecting the environment to

128
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,750
still resemble what it looked
like in 2009, when

129
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,170
that's not the case.

130
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,480
So what should you be doing?

131
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,170
If you're a game developer
today, how do you get your

132
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,060
message out?

133
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,330
How you embrace users?

134
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,130
How do you market your product
properly when this may not be

135
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,120
necessarily be your
wheelhouse?

136
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,830
The good news is that there's
a very established ecosystem

137
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,480
that's well-versed in
understanding how to get your

138
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,290
signal out there with lots of
noise in the ecosystem.

139
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,040
And that multiverse is
called the internet.

140
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,070
So the question really for this
talk, and what I really

141
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,730
want to address to everyone here
today is what can the web

142
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,770
to teach us about making
more successful games?

143
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,340
And I'm not saying put all
your games on the web.

144
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,370
I'm talking about learning and
adapting and bringing the

145
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,060
principles and traits of the web
into your game development

146
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,600
process, and your game, to
make it more successful.

147
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,190
Or better yet, what makes
clicking a link and seeing a

148
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,880
cat such a compelling vehicle
for content that people

149
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,820
continuously do it?

150
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,430
That cat right there alone has
some ungodly number of

151
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,290
hundreds of thousands
of views.

152
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,780
That's an amazing vehicle
and an amazing process.

153
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,690
So what we're going to talk
about today is three ways that

154
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,590
you're going to be able to
webify your game, and

155
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,720
hopefully, or more specifically,
have success in

156
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,870
making better games.

157
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,350
The first part is going to be to
ship all of your platforms.

158
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,120
Now there's a great story that
I'm going to tell, and if this

159
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,970
story's about you,
I apologize.

160
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,510
I was actually at a game
developer conference a few

161
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,025
weeks ago, and talked to a lot
of people on the floor, and

162
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:01,170
was just getting a pulse on
what game developers were

163
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,760
going through.

164
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,430
And I was talking to this
developer who was lamenting

165
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,520
over the state of the mobile
ecosystem, and how he wasn't

166
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,900
making millions and millions
of dollars like he was

167
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,880
expecting to.

168
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,670
And so I said to him, hey that's
cool, how are you doing

169
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,850
in the other ecosystems?

170
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,830
How are you doing not on mobile,
or in the competing

171
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,040
mobile ecosystem?

172
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,050
And his response was, I'm
not in those ecosystems.

173
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,380
I'm only in this one place.

174
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,160
You can only find
my program here.

175
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,010
And I kind of stopped and looked
at him, like wait,

176
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,440
you're not anywhere else?

177
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,770
Why are you not embracing
these other ecosystems?

178
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,620
He says, well, I don't think
it's worth my time, and/or I

179
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,010
don't have money to do it.

180
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,680
This was not news to me.

181
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,960
But I definitely think it was
one of those spots where I can

182
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,840
honestly say, I believe
that game developers

183
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,530
are doing it wrong.

184
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,710
If you're a game developer and
you're making a piece of

185
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,590
content, you should be
understanding that the success

186
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,990
of your studio and the success
of your content is directly

187
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,280
related to how many people can
access it and purchase it.

188
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,290
In marketing or in sales,
you call this

189
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,830
the top of the funnel.

190
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,150
If you only have two million
potential customers, and you

191
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,310
hope to get 10% out of it, is
that going to keep your studio

192
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,590
afloat over time?

193
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,370
This is the critical question.

194
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,390
Should you be locking your
content only to one platform?

195
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,490
There's a great quote by
a guy named Mark Cuban.

196
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,890
Hopefully you know who he is.

197
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,040
His comment is, make your
product easier to buy than

198
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,760
your competition or you're going
to find them buying your

199
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,660
competitor product
instead of yours.

200
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,800
Now this is very important.

201
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,360
So let's take a real world
application for example.

202
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,240
Let's say you've
got a headache.

203
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,669
I've got a really bad headache,
and I'm sitting at

204
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,390
home, and I'm out of any
headache medicine.

205
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,039
I get my car.

206
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,690
I'm going to drive to the
closest, most convenient place

207
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,059
to get headache medicine.

208
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm going to walk in the store,
and I'm going to pick

209
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,220
from the things that are
available on that shelf for me

210
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,340
to purchase.

211
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,440
Now if your product isn't being
served or delivered

212
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,180
there, then there's no
opportunity for me to purchase

213
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,840
your product.

214
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,990
Even though I may like
your product.

215
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,850
I may know your product.

216
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,190
I may have purchased it two
miles down the road in a

217
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,040
different store.

218
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,390
The fact is that right now,
I'm going to choose the

219
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,420
easiest option to purchase
the product as possible.

220
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,000
So what happens is, let's say
you have your content.

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,230
Your content's out in the wild,
and you put it on a

222
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,260
specific platform.

223
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,380
Well that's fine for the users
that have already breached the

224
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,610
barrier of entry to get
to your content.

225
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,870
This is pretty easy for them.

226
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,010
You just have to find a way to
connect from your platform to

227
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,900
the people.

228
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,460
But there's a whole group of
people over here who maybe

229
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,910
entirely willing to
pay you oodles of

230
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,450
money for your content.

231
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,540
You may find your true fans
here, or your connoisseurs, or

232
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,220
your collectors, who have no
ability to actually access

233
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,700
your content because they may
not already be on the

234
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,580
platform, or are unwilling to
adopt that platform due to

235
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,210
various reasons.

236
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,040
Maybe they don't sign up for an
email, or they don't want

237
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,180
to buy $700 worth of hardware
in order to then pay extra

238
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,410
money for your content.

239
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,240
And really what you should be
doing, is because of the fact

240
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,030
that games are digitally
distributable &mdash;

241
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,510
we have the ability to just go
and download the content &mdash;

242
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,490
you should really be embracing
the ability to allow the user

243
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,162
to get the content directly
from you as the developer.

244
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:07,260
Four or five years ago, this
kind of was unheard of because

245
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,320
of the avenues online.

246
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,700
It was really hard for a
standard developer to actually

247
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,950
put the product online and sell
it to people directly.

248
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,530
There was lots of DRM
issues out there.

249
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,100
Console was kind of
the big thing.

250
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,770
A lot of people didn't
put focus in this.

251
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,470
But today, in 2012,
is very different.

252
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,200
I want to talk to specifically
about a great success story.

253
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,780
There's a game out there
called Gratuitous Space

254
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,470
Battles, by Positech Games.

255
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,800
And it's a fantastic game.

256
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,820
It's beautifully done.

257
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,010
It's all in 2D.

258
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,600
And it was done by basically a
little indie developer that

259
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,550
shipped it in 2009.

260
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,630
Now the developer of this, Cliff
Harris, actually came

261
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,110
out at a great talk called World
of Love a long time ago.

262
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,010
And the whole point of his talk
was, hey, I'm an indie.

263
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,950
I need money.

264
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,210
Here's how I'm going outside of
these channels to market my

265
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,240
game and get money from
other avenues.

266
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,570
And one of the big things he
came to with this was that he

267
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,920
believed dominantly that you
should be allowing users to

268
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,270
buy from your website.

269
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,640
And in fact, if you actually
visit the Gratuitous Battles

270
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,300
website, you can actually
see tons of icons there.

271
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,390
You can buy with Amazon, with
PayPal, with Google Checkout.

272
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,240
There is a plethora of ways
for you to give him your

273
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,910
money, if you already are
signed in, or have an

274
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,200
established rapport, or an
account on file, and whatnot.

275
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,800
This is really cool, because it
allows him to effectively

276
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,450
connect with his customers
outside of the ebb and flow of

277
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,170
digital distribution
platforms.

278
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,920
He can actually connect at
a much deeper level.

279
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,970
And his website goes on
further to say this.

280
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:34,980
If you actually got us website,

281
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,770
he's got a great quote.

282
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,040
He says, you should buy from
us because of the fact that

283
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,860
when you buy from us, I
get 91% of the money.

284
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,710
Only 9% actually goes to the
credit card payment people.

285
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,720
And this is really cool, because
this allows him to

286
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,430
actually connect with
his users, say

287
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,480
hey, I'm a real person.

288
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,700
I have a real job.

289
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,640
Please buy the content
directly from me.

290
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,180
It's fantastic.

291
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,820
He goes on further to say if
you do buy from me, I will

292
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,780
send you pictures of cats.

293
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,980
Now where else on the internet
are you going to be able to

294
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,790
find the ability to connect with
users like this at that

295
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,370
deep of a level?

296
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,530
You can't actually connect
like this in digital

297
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,420
distribution platforms.

298
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,130
Specifically, when a user wants
your product, they have

299
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,310
to go to some site that explains
your product, and

300
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,050
accept permissions and
get it from there.

301
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,520
No, these guys over here that
make Gratuitous Space Battles

302
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,550
are telling you, please, buy my
product and I will give you

303
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,810
pictures of cats.

304
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,740
Only on the internet can you
have that sort of relationship

305
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,250
with the user.

306
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,810
And best off, look at that.

307
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,740
He's saying that if you give me
your email and don't even

308
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,270
buy the product, I'll just
send you cat pictures.

309
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,200
This is great.

310
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,750
He has the ability to create an
entire marketing chain and

311
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,680
email list, a group of people
who are interested in his

312
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,400
product, and are willing to
receive pictures of cats, that

313
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,390
he can then market
to over time.

314
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,370
He has the ability to have a
connection with his user

315
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,880
because they're going direct
to his website that other

316
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,750
developers can't get because
they're relying entirely on a

317
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,840
silo distribution.

318
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,910
And with this, you have to
understand that you also get

319
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,140
other benefits.

320
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,440
And the second thing is, from
our three set, is that with

321
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,510
the ability to connect with
your user, you have the

322
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,920
ability to actually talk
with them earlier.

323
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,880
You have the ability to
get their feedback.

324
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,180
You have the ability to make
changes and make a product

325
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,000
that they actually care about.

326
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,870
So anyone know this guy?

327
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,100
This is Michelangelo.

328
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,100
He's very famous for carving
this statue,

329
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,290
the statue of David.

330
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,720
Now when Michelangelo was later
in his life, he actually

331
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,930
give a great quote to someone
that says, "Along with the

332
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,380
milk of my nurse, I received the
knack of handling a chisel

333
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,020
and hammer, with which
I make my figures."

334
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,550
Now for those of you don't know
the life of Michelangelo,

335
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,010
his family actually fell on some
hard times, and he, as a

336
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,460
young child, actually had to
go live with his wet nurse.

337
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,470
The wet nurse and her
family actually

338
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,170
lived in a marble quarry.

339
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,700
The father of the family
actually mined marble, which

340
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,670
meant that Michelangelo, as a
young child living in this

341
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,840
environment, had marble just
laying around his house for

342
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,470
him to play with.

343
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,030
During this entire time, he was
able to go outside, chisel

344
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,300
marble, play with marble,
manipulate marble.

345
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,840
He had a feedback loop of how
to play with marble that his

346
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,910
competitors had never gotten.

347
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,640
He had spend more time failing
and playing with marble by the

348
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,370
time he was 12 than any other
sculptors had done their

349
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,700
entire lifetime, because
how expensive

350
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,040
marble was at that time.

351
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,900
The point of this was that
Michelangelo had found that

352
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,100
iteration in a medium resulted
in better results.

353
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,920
And the fact that he could
iterate better than his

354
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,470
competitors resulted
in his success.

355
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,990
And the statue David is a
perfect example of that.

356
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,850
AAA game development does
not necessarily follow

357
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,170
this path very well.

358
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,240
Now what you see with a big
budget title typically in a

359
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,980
console development cycle right
now, is that you end up

360
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,760
with an early prototype phase.

361
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,410
And then you'll probably go
through about two or three

362
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,230
years worth of development
cycle.

363
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,610
And only then, after the
internal development cycle for

364
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,190
three years, will you actually
go into public beta.

365
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,870
Now take a look at this.

366
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,910
The only time that the public,
the consumers, the people that

367
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,270
are actually going to be buying
the product, have

368
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,020
actually seen the product and
played with the product, is

369
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,570
during this beta phase.

370
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,330
This means that all of the
feedback that they've gotten

371
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,440
on their content has
been internal only.

372
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,580
With that in mind, it kind of
makes a lot of sense that most

373
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,740
console games always ship
their slip date.

374
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,900
Once you go into beta, you get
all this feedback from people

375
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,560
saying these icons are wrong, or
I don't like this, or this

376
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,955
thing is overpowered, or they
stress the system in new ways,

377
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:31,460
and then the shipping gets
slipped again and again, or as

378
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,190
long as they financially
can hand out.

379
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,250
And then finally the product
hits the shelves.

380
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,040
Now what this means is, if you
look at this development

381
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,010
cycle, you end up with a four
year development span costing

382
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,680
$40 million, where the user
is only brought in the

383
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,640
conversation the last
25% or 30%.

384
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,590
Those are the people actually
buying your product.

385
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,780
And yet you don't actually have
a conversation with them

386
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,480
about the product until much
later in the cycle.

387
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,420
What you actually see is that
they're going through this.

388
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,580
Internally, they say, is this
product awesome yet?

389
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,000
If not, let's change
a bunch of stuff

390
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,050
and see if it's again.

391
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,800
And then oops, we ran out
of time, let's ship it.

392
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,380
The problem here again is that
there should be a bubble in

393
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,830
there where it says, is this
awesome yet, consumer?

394
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,490
And the consumer says, yes or
no, here's my feedback.

395
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,410
Minecraft is a perfect example
of where this went right.

396
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,420
For those of you guys who don't
know the story of how

397
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,030
Minecraft got off the ground,
in 2009, Minecraft actually

398
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,820
went public with an alpha.

399
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,450
And with that, you could
actually buy the alpha and get

400
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,740
the full version later.

401
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,210
Effectively, what the developers
were doing is, they

402
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,440
still had day jobs.

403
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,270
They shipped Minecraft
on the side.

404
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,703
And they said, hey, if you're
willing to pay me now, $20,

405
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:42,000
$25, something like that, then
when the full version comes

406
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,570
out later, you'll get the full
version plus all the upgrades

407
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,190
and all the other cool stuff.

408
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,350
What this allowed them to do
was actually find a pool of

409
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,360
true fans, people actually cared
about the product, early

410
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,080
this development cycle, that are
willing to pay for it and

411
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,970
then receive feedback
from it over time.

412
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,480
The result of this was
actually amazing.

413
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,870
In 2010, they actually
shipped their beta.

414
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,859
And, funny story, the actual
company was founded in 2010,

415
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,329
when Paypal actually suspended
their account from the alpha

416
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,190
purchases, when it ended up with
like $700,000 in there.

417
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,630
PayPal actually thought it was
a hack, some piracy was going

418
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,690
on, something bad
was happening.

419
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,400
And they had to found their
company in order to properly

420
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,869
receive these funds
and tunnel them

421
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,390
into development properly.

422
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,320
The cool thing about this is
that users were paying the

423
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,030
company to provide feedback
about their product.

424
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,330
In any other medium that you
want external feedback, you

425
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,980
usually have to go
pay someone else.

426
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,340
If you want a consultant to come
in and tell you how your

427
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,460
blinds should be shaped, or you
want external writers to

428
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,880
comment on your new manifest
portfolio, whatever it is, you

429
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,300
usually have to go find
these people and pay

430
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,500
them for their opinion.

431
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,320
Game developers were paying
Mojang to give

432
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,350
their opinion to them.

433
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,310
This is a completely different
ecosystem that gamers are

434
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,560
willing to justify.

435
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,430
I'm willing to pay you
and tell you how to

436
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,380
make the game better.

437
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,300
That's fantastic, and the
results show themselves.

438
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,610
In 2011, the PC and mobile game
actually shipped, the

439
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,490
stable versions.

440
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,745
And they actually had so many
people that loved the game and

441
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:17,060
did so many things, they had
the MineCon convention.

442
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,250
How many games do you know
actually start from nothing,

443
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,310
build a community, and actually
have a convention

444
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,020
that ships a couple
of years later?

445
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,160
Today, it's reported that
Minecraft has over 9 million

446
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,230
sales and has lots of
SKUs cross-platform.

447
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,410
This is a perfect example of
shipping early, getting

448
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,270
feedback from users,
and then creating a

449
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,900
success story from it.

450
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,490
Little known fact in the mobile
ecosystem, Angry Birds

451
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,970
was actually the 30th
game that Rovio

452
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,390
shipped in three years.

453
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,030
That's actually a great
statistic, 30

454
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,640
games in three years.

455
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,820
What Rovio was able to do, was
able to ship games quickly,

456
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,730
receive feedback about them
as a unit, as a product &mdash;

457
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,640
like, they didn't have the time
to do a full cycle and

458
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,760
say, how do you want this game
to change, and do that for

459
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,460
three years with their
customers.

460
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,660
They would basically make a
product, get information, ship

461
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,250
it quickly, receive as much
feedback as they can from

462
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,890
that, incorporate that into the
next product that allowed

463
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,710
them to be featured once again
in the mobile ecosystem.

464
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,610
Because that's how it works in
mobile right now, is it's

465
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,560
easier to get a new piece of
content featured than it is an

466
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,290
existing piece of content.

467
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,430
So for them to stay on the top
the charts, they had to keep

468
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,650
pushing out new products.

469
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,730
And Angry Birds was the
result of that.

470
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,850
They were able to get feedback
and incorporate it quickly.

471
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,400
A more recent example, a game
called Temple Run, was

472
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,970
actually the 11th game
in four years.

473
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,640
You should be seeing
a trend here.

474
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,710
Game developers who are shipping
more games in the

475
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,320
mobile space are getting better
feedback cycle with

476
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,290
their users.

477
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,170
And then game developers in
the PC space, in the web

478
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,810
space, are able to have better
connectivity with their users

479
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,860
and get more feedback sooner,
allowing them to make a better

480
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,060
product over time.

481
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,270
And the cool thing is, that
once you have the user's

482
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,590
attention, once you're able to
distribute to them from all

483
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,500
the platforms, once you're able
to actually get them in a

484
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,900
dialogue from you, you'll find
it one of the most important

485
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,000
things that you can do
is get them into

486
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,080
your product quickly.

487
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,780
And this is probably the most
technical discussion we're

488
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,770
going to have today about
webify your game.

489
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,750
And it's the concept
of instant on.

490
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,110
If you read the papers about the
internet, you should know

491
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,290
that the internet is ruled by
a law of three seconds.

492
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,080
And that is that a user will
abandon a website if it isn't

493
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,760
loaded in three seconds.

494
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,370
A perfect example of this, a
long time ago, in a galaxy

495
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,160
far, far away, there was a
company called Google who had

496
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,490
a very amazing search engine.

497
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,340
And they actually asked their
users, would you like to see

498
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,140
more results per page?

499
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,890
Would you like 30 results
or 10 results?

500
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,540
Overwhelmingly, of course, the
users of the search engine

501
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,520
said, please give us 30.

502
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
When they implemented it and got
all the engineering done,

503
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,400
what they found was that their
click-through traffic actually

504
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,490
dropped about 20%.

505
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,690
And they didn't understand
why.

506
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,790
They implemented what the users
want, but yet they were

507
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,850
losing traffic.

508
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,870
When they went back and looked
at everything, they noticed

509
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:04,800
that the extra results caused
a half of a second delay in

510
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,700
the site loading.

511
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,560
Half a second of delay was
resulting in 20% of the users

512
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,520
just abandoning the website.

513
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,400
The internet is a consumer's
market.

514
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,980
They understand that
data is everywhere.

515
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,240
And if I think that your site is
slow, and I know that I can

516
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,540
get that data somewhere
else, I'm just going

517
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,150
to exit your site.

518
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,340
Because I feel I can find it
faster than waiting for your

519
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,410
slow site to load.

520
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,730
This is the rule of
the internet.

521
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,320
It's the law.

522
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,370
And there's tons of papers that
have shown personalities

523
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,800
and studies that reflect
that yes, three

524
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,680
seconds is the limit.

525
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,100
Now there's a great quote that
shows that this actually

526
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,940
affects game developers
as well.

527
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,300
There's a great quote from
Rich Helleman, who gave a

528
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,230
fantastic talk at New
Game in 2011.

529
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,430
He says, "Increasingly, the
capacity we are arguing for

530
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:55,230
with our customers is not their
money, but their time."

531
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,450
Rich understands that the
important thing to do now, in

532
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,470
the ecosystem that we're in now
with gaming, is get the

533
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,430
user's time.

534
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,340
Because the time will
result in the money.

535
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,390
A long time ago with console,
the most important thing to do

536
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,510
was get the money.

537
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,110
Because then the time
came afterwards.

538
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,080
Once I had your purchase, you
would then spend 30 hours

539
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,070
playing my products.

540
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,020
But that was because the
ecosystem wasn't as saturated

541
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,500
as it is today.

542
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,120
Now, game developers are
fighting for nuances of

543
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,000
attention that the user can
spend with their product.

544
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,260
And if they can get your
attention and make you a user,

545
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,610
they know they can get you make
you become a customer.

546
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,670
So now game developers have to
respect the user's time.

547
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,240
This is a great example.

548
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,850
Anyone know this game?

549
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,240
This is Mass Effect 2.

550
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,770
Probably one of the largest
criticisms for this game was

551
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,390
actually their elevator
loading screens.

552
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,040
This actually had a huge
uproar on the internet.

553
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,530
Lots of people were very
critical of this.

554
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,270
In fact, one of the most common
forum posts you could

555
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,020
find is, OMG, WTF, what about
these loading screens?

556
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,150
I could go make a cheeseburger
and come back before the next

557
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:57,980
level is loaded.

558
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,410
And what you saw here was a very
negative uproar to long

559
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,300
load times.

560
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,530
Now the internet has seen the
same thing in practice.

561
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,220
There's actually been research
that finds that users who

562
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,470
experience slow load times for
a website are more likely to

563
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,710
complain to their friends
about the experience.

564
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,810
Which means that you've not
only lost a current user.

565
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,830
You've actually lost another
potential user who may view

566
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,080
your site as not worth
their time.

567
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,800
In fact, the uproar for Mass
Effect was so large, a very

568
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,200
popular web game comic blog &mdash;

569
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,030
blogish &mdash;

570
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,550
I don't even know how they even

571
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,520
define themselves anymore.

572
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,380
Anyhow, Penny Arcade did a
comic on this, where they

573
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,170
basically said, this alien
civilization has died from the

574
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,020
ecosystem and I don't
know what happened,

575
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,010
but I have an idea.

576
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,560
It's probably because they all
died in the elevators waiting

577
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,760
to go from floor to floor.

578
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,650
And basically what happened is,
for all the people who had

579
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,360
never played Mass Effect 2,
and this was the only

580
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,770
experience they got was Penny
Arcade saying, whoa, the load

581
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,070
times are too long, there was
a whole pool of customers

582
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,530
who've now been negatively
influenced simply

583
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,682
because of load time.

584
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:07,330
And it's important to understand
that load time is a

585
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,270
technical problem.

586
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,590
It's not necessarily
a design problem.

587
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,150
Design can hide the technical
limitations.

588
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,240
But in reality, what you're
doing is you're fighting

589
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,190
through multiple stages here.

590
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,210
First off, you've got some
medium, be it compact disc or

591
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,430
actually hard drive, that needs
to get transferred into

592
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,390
memory, and that's typically
limited by the transfer rates

593
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,850
of the medium to memory.

594
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,820
And then from the memory, you've
got to get it back over

595
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,300
the GPU, if you're doing any
sort of rendering, or even

596
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,110
just transform the data into
some form that your system is

597
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,760
going to use.

598
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,190
So loading up a binary trees, or
spatial hierarchies, or A*

599
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,020
path finding.

600
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,890
All that data has got
to be processed.

601
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,180
And so for you to have something
like instant load

602
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,870
times, to get your product
to actually load in three

603
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,370
seconds, you have to optimize
each one of these scenarios

604
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,060
independently.

605
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,890
Another great example is a
game called Half-Life.

606
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,710
This was probably one of the
first that came to the table

607
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,140
with a unique solution.

608
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,110
So for those of you who've
played Half-Life and the

609
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,190
series sort of following &mdash;

610
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,280
Half-Life 2, and Left 4 Dead,
and all those other ones &mdash;

611
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,700
you'll notice that at the end
of a level, you'll typically

612
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,920
have about 400 foot worth of
additional space for you just

613
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,620
kind of run.

614
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,460
There's no monsters there, you
don't know what's going on.

615
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,720
You're just jumping over
some creates and

616
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,920
running up some ladders.

617
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,730
But then all of the sudden
you'll see this screen, which

618
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,240
is that little loading blip.

619
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,090
And that loading blip will come
on and then disappear.

620
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,160
What the artists and designers
and programmers at Valve were

621
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,800
able to do was actually add
extra geometry into the

622
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,600
environment.

623
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,300
And when you would hit a
specific trigger point, they

624
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,570
would be able to start loading
in the next level of content

625
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,280
while you're running through
these extra 400 foot.

626
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,680
The result was that you would
only see that loading blip for

627
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,570
a very small amount of time.

628
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,830
Rather than having to go through
a full level load,

629
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,880
they were able to predict what
you're going to do and how

630
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,990
you're going to do it, and
start the stream earlier.

631
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,350
Because they knew that the
medium of getting from disk to

632
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,240
memory was the slow part,
and that they could

633
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,580
hide it with design.

634
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,390
So the question we have overall
in instant on is can

635
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,950
your load times be under
three seconds?

636
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,050
Can the gaming community as a
whole adopt this feature of

637
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,760
the internet?

638
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,290
Can your game be instant on?

639
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,750
And what I'm not talking about
here is instant on only from

640
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,790
disk to memory.

641
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,410
So if you're actually doing
digital distribution, and the

642
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,930
user goes in purchases your
content, they're going to have

643
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,930
to wait around for your content
to be downloaded.

644
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,660
I'm not talking about instant
on after this point.

645
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,340
I'm talking about instant on
from the user saying, buy,

646
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,440
thank you, or clicking a link,
or getting a referral, or

647
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,140
having the ability to access
your content for the very

648
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,700
first time, all the way
to actually being

649
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,260
able to play it.

650
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,620
Can they do that in
three seconds?

651
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,190
Now if you're not getting your
product to your user through a

652
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,835
digital distribution platform,
then really, the avenue that

653
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:42,900
you have to look at is how you
can get content to your users

654
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,940
through the internet.

655
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,970
You'll notice each one of these
arrows has already a ton

656
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,990
of literature out there on how
you can optimize that, how you

657
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,040
can make load times from disk
to memory faster, and memory

658
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,940
to GPU, et cetera, et
cetera, et cetera.

659
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,740
But what really hasn't been
talked about, because it's not

660
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,450
been really conquered yet,
is how you can increase &mdash;

661
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,540
or decrease load times from
internet to memory.

662
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,270
So let's talk about
that for a second.

663
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,180
So let's say you have a user who
sits in the United States

664
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,630
and he wants a piece
of content.

665
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,970
Well, that content will be on
some server, sitting in some

666
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,580
basement of some dude's house,
and that content can be

667
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,690
shipped to them over
the inter-tubes.

668
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,180
The issue is, once the user ends
up far, far away, that

669
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,580
the ability to get that content
quickly diminishes.

670
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,210
And this is because
of two factors,

671
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,850
bandwidth and latency.

672
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,130
Now, bandwidth is typically
what you pay for when you

673
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,940
actually go to your internet
service provider.

674
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,120
They usually have some sort of
package system, and they limit

675
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,150
it based upon throttling
all these other things.

676
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,120
But what they're talking about
is buying bandwidth.

677
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,620
The second problem, latency,
you actually can't

678
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,950
control that much.

679
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,790
Latency, or the speed of
latency, is actually limited

680
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,870
by physics, which is actually
limited by how fast light can

681
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,270
travel over time &mdash;

682
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,330
or over distance.

683
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:55,530
Which means that even though
you are buying 100 million

684
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,390
speed connection in America and
they have hundred million

685
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,510
speed connection in Australia,
that data this is going to hit

686
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,970
a limit on how fast you
can get to those

687
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,940
guys across the globe.

688
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,070
How this is fixed is by
duplicating that data.

689
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,240
So rather than allowing that
data to sit only one server,

690
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,770
you allow it to be duplicated
in Australia so that it can

691
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,020
actually get to that
user much quicker.

692
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,990
Now this concept is actually
duplicated in a lot of places.

693
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,760
And you can actually see that by
duplicating the data across

694
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,510
many data centers, you can get
it to users all over the world

695
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,210
very quickly.

696
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,720
Now this is at its
core a content

697
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,900
delivery network, or CDN.

698
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,000
This is sort of the backbone of
the internet, the ability

699
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,910
to distribute content to people
quickly because it's

700
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,340
duplicated in lots of places.

701
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,410
So as a developer, if you want
to get your content, and

702
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,300
you're selling it worldwide, if
you're selling your game,

703
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,270
you need to make sure that
you're using CDNs to

704
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,950
distribute your content.

705
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,010
Now there's some interesting
properties with this.

706
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,060
Let's talk about load
times again.

707
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,090
So let's say the you're a AAA
game, and you have one

708
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,660
gigabyte of content.

709
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,630
That's actually going to take
about seven minutes to

710
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,530
transfer on a 20 megabits
per second connection.

711
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,720
So if you've got one gig, you
want to get it to a user,

712
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,240
that's seven minutes of their
time that they're going to

713
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
have to sit around and wait.

714
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,750
So if you assume, just naively,
that that one

715
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,040
gigabyte is uncompressed, then
your first step to say is,

716
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,290
hey, well, what if we just
simply compressed this data?

717
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,460
How fast we get the user?

718
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,280
Gzip is a very standard
compression.

719
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,990
It's supported by most web
servers as well as web

720
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,395
browsers, and the zlib
library, and

721
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:17,220
lots of other things.

722
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,880
That will actually take a given
set of one gigabyte

723
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,190
content and get down to
about 330 megabytes.

724
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,370
That 330 megs will take about
two minutes and 12 seconds to

725
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,350
transfer and decompress.

726
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,720
Because we have to take into
account the time to actually

727
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,570
decompress the data.

728
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,050
Now, that's fine.

729
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,370
That's great, but can
we get lower?

730
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,930
If you look at the internet,
there's actually some new

731
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,550
cutting edge compression
algorithms out there.

732
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,720
One of them, probably my
favorite, is one called LZHAM.

733
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,170
That will actually take that
same one gig of data and get

734
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,740
it down to about 204 megabytes,
which reduces your

735
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,825
transfer time and decompression
time to one

736
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:52,530
minute and 18 seconds.

737
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,270
Now this is good, right?

738
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,160
We're starting to see that as
your data gets compressed,

739
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,310
more can come to the
user faster.

740
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,030
Let's take a look at another
thing, using CDNs.

741
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,950
There's an implicit cost
with using a CDN.

742
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,300
So let's say that you've
got some super

743
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,410
successful web game.

744
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,570
And let's say at your best,
you're doing about 3.4 million

745
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,870
unique users a day.

746
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,870
These are people that have
never seen your content

747
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,800
before, coming to your content
for the very first time, and

748
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,880
receiving your content.

749
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,440
Now obviously, this is a worst
case scenario, because if you

750
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,260
get 3.4 million users every day
coming to your game, you

751
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,720
probably don't care about
transfer times.

752
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,950
So that's a separate
discussion.

753
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,100
So if you're actually
transferring 3.4 million users

754
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,500
a day, one gigabyte of data is
actually going to cost you

755
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,610
about $9,600 to get that
data to those users

756
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,120
every single day.

757
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,620
With compression with gzip,
that actually cuts down to

758
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,360
about $2,900.

759
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,040
So you see the number of bits
crossing the wire reduced,

760
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,840
reduce the cost involved with
distributing that content.

761
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,280
And of course, LZHAM then cuts
it down even further, getting

762
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,940
you to about $1,900 a day.

763
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,120
So that's actually still a lot
of data and a lot of cost.

764
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,440
If you have 3.4 million users,
you have to actually take a

765
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,420
look and say, do we need to ship
one gigabyte to a user

766
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,020
before they're allowed to see
a pixel on the screen?

767
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,710
I'm sure if you look at your
assets and you look at your

768
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,820
design, you'll find that that's
not actually the case.

769
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,490
You could probably actually get
a much smaller subset to

770
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,800
your users, allow them to see
the content quickly, and then

771
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,630
stream in the rest
of background.

772
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,910
Which is the concept of, you
should only be sending to

773
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,690
users what they need.

774
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,850
What's the minimal amount of
data you can send to them?

775
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,760
Especially if you're
paying for it.

776
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,050
If you have a user who's not
paying for your content &mdash;

777
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,970
let's say you have a freemium
app, or there's a trial

778
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,350
application or something
like that.

779
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,760
These users are connecting to
your servers, downloading your

780
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,200
data, and you're paying for that
transfer for someone who

781
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,120
may not be paying to you.

782
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,070
And so you want to minimize the
amount of data that they

783
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,480
receive that comes out
of your pocket.

784
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,090
There's a great example
of this, a

785
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,050
very successful example.

786
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,980
I hope you all know it.

787
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,680
It's called World of Warcraft.

788
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,680
World of Warcraft came out with
a great streaming demo a

789
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,480
while ago, called Try WoW.

790
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,290
And what Try WoW did, was
effectively bundle the first

791
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,570
25 megabytes of the World of
Warcraft experience into a

792
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,930
single package, a single
executable, that the user

793
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,960
could download very quickly on
a 20 megabits per second pipe

794
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,650
that actually came down around
10 seconds or so.

795
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,040
And then after that, while the
user was configuring their

796
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,910
character and learning a little
bit about the game,

797
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:19,090
they were actually streaming in
the next 20 hours or so of

798
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,560
gameplay and caching it
locally on the disk.

799
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,270
So the user only actually had
to grab 25 megs first, then

800
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,380
they could start playing
the game.

801
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,310
And then as they started
progressing and experiencing

802
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,140
more content, they would get the
larger and larger pieces

803
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,590
of content coming down.

804
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,400
This allowed the developer of
World of Warcraft to kind of

805
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,160
balance what content came
through the pipe, how much

806
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,080
cost did it take them to acquire
a new user, how much

807
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,860
they were losing to people who
were trying to game but not

808
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,390
actually purchasing of the
content, et cetera.

809
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,630
They had lot more data because
they were segmenting the

810
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,540
content properly.

811
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,390
So now if we assume that
204 megs that LZHAM was

812
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,030
compressing our gig to, and we
tried to bundle it up like

813
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,020
this &mdash; let's say 24 megs went
to two million users a day,

814
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,410
and 172 of that megs one to
1.4 million users a day.

815
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,840
This actually changes your
scale and your cost quite

816
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,700
significantly.

817
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,450
The 24 meg is actually going
to cost you $132 a day.

818
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,890
And then you're going to pay
around $700 for the 172 megs.

819
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,210
The total is about half of
what you were paying by

820
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,000
sending a gig to every user.

821
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,640
And this is a very successful
strategy.

822
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,720
It allows you to also understand
your content and

823
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,410
the deeper level.

824
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,370
It lets you care about what your
users are experiencing,

825
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,850
how they're experiencing, and
what data is needed from your

826
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,640
studio to get them the right
vision of your message.

827
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,400
It's like taking a blog and
compressing into 140 bytes, or

828
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,800
140 characters, so
you can get your

829
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,940
message out to the people.

830
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,300
Now there's a great game that
goes even further than this.

831
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,130
It's a game called Realm
of the Mad God.

832
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:44,890
Hopefully you've played it.

833
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,750
It's a fantastic product
that's up on the web.

834
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,090
And because it's a web game,
these guys have actually

835
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,880
optimized in a different
direction.

836
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,020
Their entire game
is 1.29 megs.

837
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,180
That's the whole product.

838
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,460
Effectively it's a fantasy
MMO shooter online.

839
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,380
So you've got tons of people
shooting bullets at each other

840
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,230
and dodging.

841
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,200
It's really cool.

842
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,930
The point is that with that 1.29
megs, if they distribute

843
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,139
that to 3.4 million unique
users a day,

844
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,610
that costs them $12.

845
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,580
So they've taken a very unique
approach to the problem.

846
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:19,880
How small can we make this
product, because load times

847
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,360
matter on the internet.

848
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,610
It takes about 1.3 seconds to
transfer and boot up Realm of

849
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,300
the Mad God the first time
you've played it.

850
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,969
And if 3.4 million users are
getting that content every

851
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,170
day, it only costs
the developer $12

852
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,500
to ship that content.

853
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,989
This is a great intersection
point of understanding

854
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:38,989
transfer time plus
cost ratios.

855
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,110
And this is where you're going
to have to start optimizing as

856
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,250
game developers.

857
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,570
If you want your content to be
available outside of the

858
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,469
digital distribution platforms
that you have today, so that

859
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:49,340
you can have a deeper, richer
conversation with your

860
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,139
consumers, you can get feedback
with them earlier,

861
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,400
you need the ability to have
your game load quickly and the

862
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,240
cost of scales involved with
that are minimized.

863
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,080
There's a great quote, and
I'll leave you with this.

864
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,250
"It is not the strongest of the
species that survives, nor

865
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,460
the most intelligent, but the
one most responsive to

866
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,400
change." This is a great
quote about evolution.

867
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,040
What we're seeing in the games
industry right now is a very

868
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,470
evolution-based moment.

869
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,130
We've got tons and tons of
little organisms out there all

870
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,000
fighting for life, trying to
stay stable, trying to create

871
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,910
their own little niches
and ecosystems.

872
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,360
And some will survive,
and some won't.

873
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,670
Your product, your game, your
studio, in order to be

874
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:30,410
responsive to last out this time
of change, you need to be

875
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,050
willing to adopt new
technologies, new standards of

876
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,810
development, and think in new
ways to reach your customer.

877
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,030
And that is the basis of
webifying your game.

878
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,060
Thank you so much
for your time.

879
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,020
I appreciate it.

880
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,020
We'll go to questions here
in a minute, once they

881
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,720
kill the live feed.

882
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,010
Again, I'm Colt McAnlis.

883
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,280
This is how you get
a hold of me.

884
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,560
Go, webify your game.

885
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,360
Make things awesome.

886
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,610
Thank you very much.

887
00:35:50,610 --> 00:36:07,333
