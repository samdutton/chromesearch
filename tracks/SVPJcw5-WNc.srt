00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,498

2
00:00:00,498 --> 00:00:43,326
[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:55,870

4
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,350
PETE LEPAGE: All right,
welcome, everybody.

5
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,790
My name's Pete LePage.

6
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,160
And today, joining me we have
Brad Frost, who's going to be

7
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,519
talking to us about some
rather cool stuff.

8
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,170
Brad, I'll leave it to you
to introduce yourself.

9
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,320
This is a reschedule of
an event that we had a

10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,750
little while ago.

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,470
So welcome, and I'll turn
it over to you.

12
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,310
BRAD FROST: Yeah.

13
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,900
Thanks, Pete.

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,820
Thanks for having me.

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,400
I appreciate it.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,060
So yeah, my name is Brad Frost
and I am a mobile web

17
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,410
strategist and front end
designer at an agency RGA,

18
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,625
which is based in New York, but
I'm broadcasting to you

19
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,500
from beautiful Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,150
So I've been spending a lot of
time talking about responsive

21
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,060
design verses separate
mobile design for

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,330
the last couple years.

23
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,630
So that'll do it.

24
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,570
In case you have been living
under a rock, you probably

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,260
realized that we had an election
not that long ago.

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,330
So that's what we're going to
talk about, is we're going to

27
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,800
talk about the presidential

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,110
candidates' mobile web strategy.

29
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,790
So this is the "Responsive
Design versus Separate Mobile

30
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,720
Sites Presidential Smackdown
Edition."

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,950
So let's get started.

32
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,960
This is a dead horse.

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,110
And this is a picture of me
beating that dead horse.

34
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,350
A lot has been talked about
regarding responsive design

35
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,610
versus making a separate mobile
website, which route to

36
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,920
go, which one to choose.

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,680
There's been a lot of great
articles, like this one, this

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,450
one, this one.

39
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,650
Google weighing in
a little bit.

40
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,510
Facebook's developers blog.

41
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,530
So a lot of people have a lot of
different opinions on which

42
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,880
way to go, what's best for your
organization as far as

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,490
what mobile web strategy
you want to choose.

44
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,000
But really, the ultimate answer
is that it depends.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,440
It really depends on the way
your company is structured,

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,620
what your budget is, what sort
of team you have in place,

47
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,620
what sort of technologies you're
working in, you're

48
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,540
proficient in, and all
of that good stuff.

49
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,660
So really, it's not a black
and white answer.

50
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,370
So if you're expecting one,
sorry about that.

51
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,380
So why are we bothering
talking about this?

52
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,060
Why am I tearing apart the
presidential candidates'

53
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,490
websites and making
them look so bad?

54
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,220
Really, because I'm a terrible
human being.

55
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,050
Actually, no.

56
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,820
That's not true.

57
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
I'm trying to be constructive
here.

58
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,870
But what it really comes down
to is that very rarely do we

59
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:45,350
have an apples to apples
comparison of when to use a

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,770
certain strategy.

61
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,560
There's a lot of factors
at play.

62
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,740
Time is a big one.

63
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,420
So even if you were to have a
separate mobile site, and then

64
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,880
redo it into a responsive
website, you're

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,310
in a different time.

66
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,820
The web landscape, the device
landscape has shifted.

67
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,410
People's behavior has shifted.

68
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,760
More people are getting
online.

69
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,230
So could you really chalk any
success or failure up to a

70
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,006
specific technique?

71
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,700
Maybe, maybe not.

72
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,820
Again, it all depends.

73
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,600
So very rarely do we have
something that's actually a

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,280
very black and white comparison
between two

75
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,300
different strategies.

76
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,450
But that's exactly what
we have for this

77
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,400
presidential election.

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,510
You have two candidates trying
to accomplish the exact same

79
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,890
thing using the exact same
mediums, only they've decided

80
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,650
to go different routes.

81
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,900
So that's why this is sort of
such an attractive case study

82
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,260
because really, all the other

83
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,980
variables are control variables.

84
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,380
You're going after the
same audience.

85
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,240
You're going after
the same goals.

86
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,670
There's no difference in what
they're trying to accomplish.

87
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,350
So let's take a look at the
candidates' websites.

88
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,290
This is Barack Obama's
website and this is

89
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,390
Mitt Romney's website.

90
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,090
And for the keen observers out
there, you'll probably notice

91
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,270
something &mdash;

92
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,660
splash screens are back
in full effect.

93
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,950
Why they went that
way is beyond me.

94
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,430
But yeah, so splash screens.

95
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,540
Apparently splash screens
are still

96
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,300
relevant in 2012, or something.

97
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,240
But this one's my favorite.

98
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,470
Are you in?

99
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,390
In the website?

100
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,700
No, I am not.

101
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,490
Please let me.

102
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,620
So once you get beyond these
little terrible splash

103
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,370
screens, you look at something
that resembles

104
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,690
something like a website.

105
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,350
So this is Barack Obama's
website and this is Mitt

106
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,280
Romney's website.

107
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,940
Sort of similar feel to both
of them, so makes very good

108
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,680
comparison.

109
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,740
So again, these are the desktop
versions of the site.

110
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,580
So we have to ask ourselves an
important question, why bother

111
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,110
with the mobile web?

112
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,510
Why are these candidates
spending any time optimizing

113
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,680
their websites for
mobile devices?

114
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,710
Well, we have sort of
some naysayers.

115
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,920
We have, oh, here we go again
with the separate mobile

116
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,670
versus responsive
design debate.

117
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,360
I predict in the future people
will get sick and tired of

118
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,710
using their mobile device as the
primary means of using the

119
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,110
internet and go back to using
a nice 27-inch flatscreen

120
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,140
monitor where they can see
everything, interact with

121
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,580
everything, and actually type on
a real keyboard versus all

122
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,560
this touchscreen nonsense.

123
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,760
We are cultivating a nation
of slide-swiping,

124
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,680
screen-surfing zombies.

125
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,030
Well, Ken.

126
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:52,090
Despite your best attempts at
sounding like a huge jerk,

127
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,660
this is pretty awesome.

128
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,460
That line is pretty amazing.

129
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,650
We are cultivating a nation
of slide-swiping,

130
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,770
screen-surfing zombies.

131
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,590
That's just great.

132
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,610
I mean, that's what's
happening.

133
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,240
We have a population that
is increasingly mobile.

134
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,330
If you look at the United
States population, it's

135
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,430
sitting somewhere around
311 million people.

136
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,550
55% of US adults access the web
through a mobile device.

137
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,540
And that number is growing it
seems every single month.

138
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,490
The number gets bigger.

139
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:33,680
In addition, a full 31% of
mobile web capable smartphone

140
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,570
users access the web primarily
through a mobile device.

141
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,470
That is how they primarily
get online.

142
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,970
Either it's the only way they
get online or absolutely the

143
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,000
primary way that they're
accessing web.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,650
This is a pretty huge deal.

145
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,880
And what that translates to in
the eyes of the candidates &mdash;

146
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,470
so the presidential
candidates &mdash;

147
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,800
is votes, right?

148
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,610
You have this whole population
that's mobile

149
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,810
first or mobile only.

150
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,730
And really, getting in touch
with them through the mobile

151
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,210
web is one of the best ways
to get in touch with them.

152
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,240
If they have a desktop only
website, it might be missing

153
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,310
out on a huge chunk
of the population.

154
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,900
So we have all these different
things that are driving to the

155
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,750
mobile web.

156
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,940
We have SMS smart links.

157
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,460
We have my favorite thing in
the world, QR codes, which

158
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,370
open the browser, which
open web pages.

159
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,010
We have email marketing,
which the candidates

160
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,789
made ample use of.

161
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:39,280
And email usage on mobile
devices is skyrocketing.

162
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,950
A lot of people use their
mobile device

163
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,010
to check their email.

164
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,730
That's one of the most
common tasks.

165
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,970
Again, you receive
a campaign email.

166
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,510
You click a link, it
opens the browser.

167
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,110
You have all these different
social media channels &mdash;

168
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,380
Twitter, Facebook, Google+,
all that good stuff, all

169
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,580
driving to the web.

170
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,640
You share pictures.

171
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,550
You share text status updates,
but you also share links.

172
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,940
And those links open the web.

173
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,930
You have search engine traffic,
and direct traffic,

174
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,940
and referral traffic, and all of
these things are driving to

175
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,460
the web on mobile devices.

176
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,210
So it matters more and more
to care about this.

177
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,280
So if we take a look at what the
candidates did with their

178
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,930
respective sites, this
is Barack Obama's

179
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,700
site on a small screen.

180
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,180
And this is Mitt Romney's
mobile site or

181
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,040
m.mittromney.com.

182
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,730
So Mitt Romney has basically
gone and made a separate

183
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,390
mobile site that exists at an
m. location, while Barack

184
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,120
Obama's is all sitting
under one roof in

185
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,250
a responsive design.

186
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,170
So we have to ask another
important question, why would

187
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,840
anybody visit the candidate's
website?

188
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,320
That's a really important
question to ask.

189
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,450
So I've broken it down into
two different sort of

190
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,940
categories of users.

191
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,100
We have more information-based
users and we have more

192
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,010
action-based users.

193
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,860
So information people are
looking for the candidates'

194
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,360
biographies, where they stand on
issues, upcoming events in

195
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,630
the local area pertinent
to the person viewing,

196
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,160
mythbusting, things like Obama
wants me to marry a penguin.

197
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,710
No, no he doesn't.

198
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,800
He gets to write back on his
own website and bust some

199
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,470
myths of things living out
there in the media.

200
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,200
And then also, just general
news updates.

201
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,780
Who the candidates chose as
their vice president picks and

202
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,810
all tat good stuff.

203
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,310
On the action side of things, we
have things like donations,

204
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,660
which is a huge, huge driver,
and the candidates make sure

205
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,790
not to leave that button
out, the donate button.

206
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,270
Volunteer, free events, you can
sign up for local events,

207
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:08,940
participate in your community
on behalf of the candidate.

208
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,380
And spread the word via
social networks

209
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,280
and all of that stuff.

210
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,480
And then, of course, buy
some swag from their

211
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,190
official shops there.

212
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,710
So those are the sort of whys.

213
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,840
Why are the candidates
caring about this?

214
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,940
Why do users care about this?

215
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,190
Why are we even bothering with
this in the first place?

216
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,590
So we need some criteria in
which to analyze and compare

217
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,540
these sites.

218
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:44,310
And Christopher Layon is a
mobile web strategist based

219
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,560
out of Minnesota.

220
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,350
And he came up with a really
clever way of looking at the

221
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,970
basic needs of a mobile
web user, or

222
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,260
just a web user really.

223
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,590
And it's based on Maslow's
hierarchy of needs.

224
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,310
We, as human beings,
have certain needs.

225
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,110
And some of those needs are more
important than others.

226
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,870
Some are prerequisites
for achieving the

227
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,680
next level of self.

228
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,750
So at the bottom of the
heap, we have our

229
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,330
physiological needs.

230
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,630
We need to be able to breathe.

231
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,595
We need to be able to eat, and
drink, and sleep, and all of

232
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:21,040
that stuff.

233
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,930
So that's really important.

234
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,680
But then, as you climb the
pyramid a little bit, we have

235
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,790
a sense of safety, a sense
of love, a sense of

236
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,980
self-actualization, and
all of that stuff.

237
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,230
So those are sort of considered
nice-to-haves

238
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,120
whenever you put them
side by side to

239
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,820
something like breathing.

240
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,490
So what Christopher did was
something very clever.

241
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,220
And he basically translated
those into the

242
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,020
needs of a web user.

243
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,520
So basically, he broke it down
into our ability to see and

244
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,350
navigate, to be able to read,
to be able to respond and

245
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,550
share, performance
is in there.

246
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,500
And then he's using the term
HTML5 as sort of as a way of

247
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,170
talking about enhancing a web
experience to take advantage

248
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,610
of some of the newer
HTML5 capabilities.

249
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,510
So what I've done is I've gone
ahead &mdash; and I really liked

250
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,260
that idea &mdash; and I took it and
sort of just simplified it a

251
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,420
little bit and broke it down
into these 4 areas.

252
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,870
We first need to be able
to access something.

253
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,890
We then need to be able
to interact with it.

254
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,300
It needs to be highly
performant.

255
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,390
And we need to take advantage
of all of the various

256
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,020
enhancements.

257
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,870
So let's start with access as it
is the most important part

258
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,530
of the pyramid.

259
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,710
So these are devices.

260
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,970
And even though I'm coming to
you over the interwebs and I

261
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,650
can't hear you, I think I still
heard an audible sigh.

262
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,120
This is the environment
we are living with.

263
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,550
This is the device landscape.

264
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,350
And it's a pretty
humbling sight.

265
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,320
This is really only just a
small smattering of the

266
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,720
devices that are out there.

267
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,815
Luke Wroblewski just posted in
an article recently that said

268
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:10,510
something like 33 major devices
were released in the

269
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,640
last 2 months.

270
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:18,890
And so it's just becoming this
staggering pace of change.

271
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,920
And we, as web developers, as
web designers, we need to pay

272
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,040
attention to all of that.

273
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,920
We need to know how to deal with
it because it's becoming

274
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,810
unruly pretty damn quick.

275
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,435
So it's important to understand
that the power of

276
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:36,400
the web is its ubiquity.

277
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,800
If you look back at this image,
no native platform, no

278
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,620
iOS app, no Android app, no
Windows Phone app, no any

279
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,100
native or proprietary
solution can reach

280
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,930
all of these devices.

281
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,180
But the web can.

282
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,730

283
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,260
Any time you find yourself in
a native versus web debate,

284
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,090
just show them a picture
like this.

285
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,310
And just say, oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,680
Can your solution reach
all of these devices?

287
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,170
I'm not saying that native
apps are worthless.

288
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,950
Quite the contrary.

289
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,290
But at the same time, the web's
level of reach is, by

290
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,370
and large, the web
super power.

291
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,970
And because of that, we
need to preserve and

292
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,740
embrace that fact.

293
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,360
We can't continue arbitrarily
locking people out just

294
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,400
because we don't like what
configuration they have.

295
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:36,730

296
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,390
PETE LEPAGE: Folks, it looks
like we may have

297
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,760
lost Brad for a sec.

298
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,420
Let's see if we can
get him back.

299
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,080
Hang on.

300
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,330
One sec.

301
00:15:43,330 --> 00:16:07,700

302
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,200
All right.

303
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,710
Well, always kind of fun dealing
with technology.

304
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,990
Brad's sitting in Pittsburgh
right now and I'm sitting here

305
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,970
in New York.

306
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,110
But it looks like
we've lost him.

307
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:24,830
So let's give him a second to
join back in and see if we can

308
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,090
get him back on.

309
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:42,680

310
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,240
All right.

311
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,490
Let's see.

312
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:57,066

313
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:29,860
[MUSIC PLAYING]

314
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,045
BRAD FROST: I lost you there.

315
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:32,150
PETE LEPAGE: Hey, no problem.

316
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,694
I'll get you back one sec.

317
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:34,168
Hang on.

318
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:35,590
BRAD FROST: Can you hear me?

319
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,490
PETE LEPAGE: I can hear
you now, yep.

320
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,204
BRAD FROST: OK.

321
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:39,656
Oh, sorry about that.

322
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:40,624
PETE LEPAGE: That's OK.

323
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,560
You're coming back
up in one sec.

324
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,360
BRAD FROST: That's pretty odd.

325
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,610
I can't hear you, Pete.

326
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,156

327
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:51,110
OK.

328
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,430
My other computer seem
to have frozen.

329
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,377
So I'm just going to share
my screen again.

330
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:59,766

331
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:02,060
And then we can continue on.

332
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,000
All right, sorry about
that everybody.

333
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,250
Technical difficulties.

334
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,480

335
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,430
Share my desktop.

336
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,400
And we're good to go.

337
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,280
Pete, can I get a thumbs up?

338
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,000
All right, perfect.

339
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,320
Thank you very much.

340
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,670
So where were we?

341
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,010
Yeah, Tim Berners-Lee drove this
point home at the opening

342
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,400
ceremony of the Olympics where
he said, this is for everyone.

343
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,880
Regardless of race, religion,
color, creed, location, mobile

344
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,280
carrier, we all have the
right to the web.

345
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,880
So we have to stop thinking in
sort of these myopic ways.

346
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,250
"Mobile users won't do
that," is something

347
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,080
that we commonly hear.

348
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,610
That's absolute horse shit.

349
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,540
Or elephant shit.

350
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,540
Or donkey shit, whatever
you prefer.

351
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,290
Mobile users will do anything
and everything desktop users

352
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,330
will do, provided is presented
in a usable way.

353
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,780
So we can't stop thinking,
or we have to stop

354
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,690
thinking of the web &mdash;

355
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,810
as the mobile web as
the web light.

356
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,200
How many people are used to
seeing something like this?

357
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,120
Sorry, that page is
not supported on

358
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,790
mobile at this time.

359
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,980
We don't allow mobile devices
on Tee Madness.

360
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,060
FollowMyHealth currently
requires a desktop browser.

361
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,710
A mobile version will
be available soon.

362
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,400
Giving us that false sense
of hope, right?

363
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,750
"The page you are trying to
visit is currently available

364
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,830
on our full HTML
site." Doritos,

365
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,660
no gallery, no articles.

366
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,800
You're using an unsupported
browser even though you're on

367
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,890
a very capable Android device.

368
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,790
Pizza Hut.

369
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:00,660
This is a really robust
single-page scrolling website,

370
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,480
but it says, "This site was
designed to be viewed on

371
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,960
standard desktops, laptops, and
tablets only." Blah, blah,

372
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,150
blah, blah, some long-winded
excuse.

373
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,470
"This website contains media
too rich for a mobile web

374
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,290
browser." like, I can't
be bothered

375
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,640
with you peasant device.

376
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,500
This is Google.

377
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,730
Sorry, guys.

378
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,480
But this is actually
for Google Mobile

379
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,715
Web Initiative thing.

380
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:33,320
And it says, "Alternately, we
suggest checking out the site

381
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,510
from your tablet if you have
one." I'm not really quite

382
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,780
sure what you would call
that guy right there.

383
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,110
That looks like a
tablet to me.

384
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,240
This is my favorite
one, though.

385
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,060
"This page has to be ideally
opened on your laptop or

386
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,540
desktop browser.

387
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,400
Once you open this link on your
computer, then you will

388
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,790
have a QR code to the URL that
needs to be opened on your

389
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,750
device."

390
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,000
Holy crap.

391
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,100

392
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,990
So really, what we're
talking about here

393
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,980
is the one web principle.

394
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,340
I'm sure we've all heard that.

395
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,130
I talk a lot about achieving
content parity across devices.

396
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,780
The term "thematic consistency,"
which was dubbed

397
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,970
by the W3C to talk about how web
experiences can look and

398
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,640
function differently provided
that the information's still

399
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
presentable in some way,
shape, or form.

400
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,210
But really what I found to be
really beneficial is to just

401
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,900
be &mdash; to talk about it in very
common sense language.

402
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,610
Say, give people
what they want.

403
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,400
If they click on a link,
they have an

404
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,270
expectation for something.

405
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,705
And it's up to us to provide
that [INAUDIBLE] and meet that

406
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,360
expectation.

407
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,800
So if we take a look at Mitt
Romney's site, this is

408
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,490
actually a previous edition
of Mitt Romney's site.

409
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,700
You get to see sort of a
breakdown of the desktop site

410
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,740
in the left, and then the mobile
site in the right.

411
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,210
But if you look at the
navigation in the mobile site,

412
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,540
you'll see that only a few
options out of the desktop

413
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,630
site appear on the mobile
version of the site.

414
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,470
So that's really bad.

415
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,400
And it leaves a lot of
questions unanswered.

416
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,860
Like, who is this guy?

417
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,870
There's no way to access
his biography.

418
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,550
Where does he stand on issues
there's no way to access that

419
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,610
information.

420
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,820
What about his plan for jobs?

421
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,290
What can he do for my state?

422
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,460
Where could I shop?

423
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,210
All of those things were
inaccessible from the mobile

424
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,100
version of the website.

425
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,650
And again, for a lot of people,
they might not know to

426
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,980
click the Full Desktop Link.

427
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,880
And as a result, they're just
going to go elsewhere for

428
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,450
their information, which
certainly could be biased in

429
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,190
some way, shape, or form.

430
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,350
So thankfully, they
did a redesign

431
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,010
that did a lot better.

432
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,270
They redesigned the site.

433
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,680
The desktop site looks
different.

434
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,350
The mobile site looks
different.

435
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:14,090
And you could see that the menu
now contains all of the

436
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,550
sections of the desktop
site, which is good.

437
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:25,040
In responsive design, it does a
lot better job of achieving

438
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,110
content parity just
because everything

439
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,960
exists under one roof.

440
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,900
But that doesn't mean
that it, by default,

441
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,550
achieves content parity.

442
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,670
A lot of times &mdash;

443
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,570
and a lot of sites do this &mdash;

444
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,740
will simply hide content
from mobile viewers.

445
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,180
So the site on the left is a
blog and it says, but, hey,

446
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,560
that's just my opinion.

447
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,310
Feel free to shoot me down
in the comments.

448
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:55,390
However, the comments and the
comment form are hidden for

449
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,650
small screen users.

450
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:01,960
So there's no comments, which
obviously is a bad thing.

451
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,640
On the right is navigation
with a lot of

452
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,980
important-sounding links.

453
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,560
Post a Job, About Us, Our
Guarantee, Contact Us.

454
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,120
All of that stuff sounds really,
really important.

455
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,210
But because space is constrained
on a small mobile

456
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:22,170
device, they've simply hidden
all of the navigation elements

457
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,690
for small screens, rendering
those things totally

458
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,350
inaccessible.

459
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,940
So if you look at Barack Obama's
redesigned site,

460
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,020
really the only thing that
I could see that was

461
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,980
inaccessible from small
screens was the store.

462
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,000
So the desktop version had a
store, but the mobile version

463
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,080
really had no way to
access shopping

464
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,340
experience from the phone.

465
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,430
Another problem with regards
to basic access is URL

466
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,550
redirection.

467
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,390
This is something
I see a lot of.

468
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,740
How many people have seen
something like this?

469
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,100
You go through.

470
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,190
You're clicking on your Twitter
feed or your Facebook

471
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,220
feed and somebody shares an m.

472
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,770
link, and you open it from
your desktop browser.

473
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,420
We see this stuff
all the time.

474
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,040
Here's Microsoft.

475
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,085
Here's this.

476
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:22,500
Here's this, this this,
this, this, this.

477
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,490
This is pretty common.

478
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,600
And then, of course, we end up
at Mitt Romney's website.

479
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,850
If you're on a mobile device
and you share Mitt Romney's

480
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:38,040
website and someone clicks
from that onto a desktop

481
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,960
browser, they get this page,
which clearly I'm sure the

482
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,300
designers never intended
for the site to be

483
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,830
viewed in this way.

484
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:54,020
This comic really sort of helps
sum it up, a lot of the

485
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,300
problems of sort of maintaining

486
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,870
separate mobile websites.

487
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,950
"Hi, I'm a server.

488
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,480
Who are you?"

489
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,140
"I'm a browser.

490
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,500
I'd like to see this article."

491
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,410
"Oh, I can help.

492
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,320
Let me get it for you.

493
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,470
Whoa, you're a smartphone
browser.

494
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:06,830
"Yeah."

495
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,120
"Cool.

496
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,780
Well, hey, I got this new mobile
version of my site.

497
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,630
Check it out.

498
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,580
Isn't it pretty?"

499
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,410
"Sure, but you just redirected
me to the main page.

500
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,820
Where's the article I wanted?"

501
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,840
"What article?

502
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,405
Who are you?

503
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:19,130
Hi, I'm a server."

504
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,190
So it's really important, URLs
are extremely important.

505
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,410
And unfortunately,
the sort of m.

506
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,700
and tablet.

507
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,350
and all of those other
dots become

508
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,160
a maintenance nightmare.

509
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,260
In addition, coming back to our
splash screen issue that I

510
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,700
brought up earlier, this
continued to the website link

511
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,370
for Obama's site.

512
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,340
You could click on that all
you want from Opera Mini,

513
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,510
which is a proxy browser.

514
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:55,460
So all the client side stuff
gets handled by the server.

515
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,990
And as a result, you get hit
with a splash screen and you

516
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,170
can click on Continue to the
Website all you want, but you

517
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,550
can't get past the
splash screen.

518
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,090
It doesn't redirect you to the
proper home page, which is a

519
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,590
really big issue.

520
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,010
All of a sudden, Opera Mini,
which is a very, very popular

521
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,050
browser, especially all over the
world, regions like Africa

522
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,710
and Asia Pacific and stuff like
that, they have no way of

523
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,250
getting to the site if they're
using that browser, which is a

524
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,540
pretty big deal.

525
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,680
So access is absolutely
fundamental.

526
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,050
Without it, you could make the
most beautiful parallaxy,

527
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,350
interactive website
you could imagine.

528
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,510
But if people can't access
it, they clearly can't

529
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,180
interact with it.

530
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,700
So let's talk about the next
tier of interaction, which is

531
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,280
interaction.

532
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,550
Obviously, there is a whole lot
of different ways a user

533
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,020
can interact with the site.

534
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,250
But I'm just going to focus on
a couple that I think are

535
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,660
pretty important.

536
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,170
So let's talk about
navigation.

537
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,420
This is my friend Quincy.

538
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,220
And my friend Quincy is
a good friend of mine.

539
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,510
And I say good friend because
I was able to peruse his

540
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:17,780
entire Facebook photo library,
pick the most embarrassing

541
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,230
photo of him, and post it
online, and show it to all you

542
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,590
people without asking him.

543
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,780
So that's how good of
a friend Quincy is.

544
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,350
So anyways, I recently moved
from New York City to

545
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,090
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

546
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,880
And the day we were supposed to
move, or the day before we

547
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,120
are supposed to move,
my wife got really,

548
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,600
really, really sick.

549
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,880
And she was supposed to drive
the car across, and help pack

550
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,230
and all of that stuff.

551
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,970
Our friend Quincy went out of
this way and said, I could

552
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,960
help you guys out.

553
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,660
And he took his entire weekend
off and drove over with us and

554
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,880
helped us move.

555
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,690
So yeah, Quincy is
a good friend.

556
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,840
But the thing is, is that we
don't really see Quincy all

557
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,360
that often.

558
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,270
We maybe see him once a month
or once every other month.

559
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:12,780
So it's a pretty big deal for
him to help us out like that.

560
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,950
So what does this have to
do about navigation?

561
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,980
I think that navigation should
be like Quincy, where it's

562
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,360
there when you need them
but cool enough to

563
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,870
give you your space.

564
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,470
Whenever a navigation
is absent, obviously

565
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,640
that's a big deal.

566
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,070
But if the nav is always
in your face &mdash;

567
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,210
this is an example of a
responsive website.

568
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,810
All these different pages, these
are different pages of

569
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,790
the website you can see by
the little active state.

570
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,810
But the navigation's
just in your way.

571
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,920
You're not able to get to the
core content of the website.

572
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,590
It becomes that friend that's
just always hanging around or

573
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,840
always annoying and just
sort of asking you

574
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,160
what you're up to.

575
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,020
Hey, want to hang out?

576
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,980
Hey, want to hang out?

577
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,590
Hey, want to go to the movies?

578
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,540
Hey, want to go to branch?

579
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

580
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,740
It's annoying, right?

581
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,100
So you want navigation to be
accessible, but you also want

582
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,760
it to be out of the way.

583
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,170
So if you look at Obama's
navigate, the previous

584
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,160
addition of Obama's website
utilized the sort of

585
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,810
Facebook-like slide-out
method.

586
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:27,540
If you're on a small screen, it
slides out from the left.

587
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,780
And whenever space becomes
available, it simply stacks

588
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,950
the links across the top.

589
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,570
So my friend Stephanie
[INAUDIBLE]

590
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,460
took a look at the navigation
and tested it out whenever it

591
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,270
first came out.

592
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,140
And she found some pretty
troubling things.

593
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,460
She said, "And the
menu failed.

594
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,690
Never even opened.

595
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,770
Suddenly, the site was without
navigation at all."

596
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,410
She tested on a lot of
different devices.

597
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:57,140
She found that it only worked on
the Galaxy Nexus, which at

598
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,790
the time, had just come
out, and an iPhone 4

599
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,270
with running iOS 5.

600
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,010
Where it didn't work, as you
could see, is a whole lot of

601
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,880
different environments.

602
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,830
And so she wrote about
this in a [INAUDIBLE]

603
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,300
for progressive enhancement.

604
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,330
And I have to say that I
totally agree with her.

605
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,500
A lot of people think of
JavaScript support as being

606
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,730
very binary.

607
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:30,720
And people say things like, oh,
of course users don't have

608
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,770
their JavaScript turned
off anymore.

609
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,665
That's very 1998 of
you to think that.

610
00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:40,300
But whenever you look at
instances like this where

611
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,890
JavaScript has failed in some
way, shape, or form, but all

612
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,580
of these different devices are
actually quite capable from a

613
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,060
JavaScript point of view, the
idea is just about providing

614
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,370
an adequate fallback
if things go wrong.

615
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,760
This is me testing Obama's
site on a BlackBerry.

616
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,590
And if you note in the top left
corner, that's where the

617
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,960
menu button should be.

618
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,260
And there's no way of getting
to the navigation.

619
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,190
It just is entirely invisible
or absent.

620
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,760

621
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,750
These are big deals.

622
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:22,800
So thankfully, whenever Obama
redesigned his website, they

623
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,960
did something a little more
clever utilizing the footer

624
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,520
anchor technique where you
basically click a link in the

625
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,570
header and it jumps you down to
the footer of the website

626
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,800
where the navigation lives.

627
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,090
And also, using the
multi-toggle, which is

628
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:43,190
basically just nesting
sub-navigation items in little

629
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,180
accordions or sort of nesting
them in there like that.

630
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,270
So the result of that is
something that's a lot more

631
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,660
accessible.

632
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,810
It works on more devices
and sort of avoids a

633
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,420
lot of those problems.

634
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,750
If we look at Mitt Romney's
website, you could see that,

635
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,500
again, this is the earlier
version of his website.

636
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,030
We talked about how it doesn't
include everything on the

637
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,590
website or on the desktop
version of the website.

638
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,590
That's a pretty big deal.

639
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,620
But it's also sort of weird
that the only navigation

640
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,350
exists on the home page.

641
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,780
The home page is sort
of this dashboard.

642
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,390
And all the other sub-pages
basically just link back to

643
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,790
the home page.

644
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,710
So there's really no navigation
on any sub-pages.

645
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:38,340
So it becomes sort of this
full-page redirect in order to

646
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,330
navigate to another section
of the site.

647
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,760
So I wouldn't say that that's
very efficient.

648
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,150
In addition, you look at things
like back buttons.

649
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,950
If you look, all browsers
have some way of

650
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,190
going back in the history.

651
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,070
So that sort of back button that
you're including there is

652
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,250
a bit redundant.

653
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,790
So again, if we look at the
updated version of Romney's

654
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:08,590
website, we see he's utilizing
what's called the toggle,

655
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,870
where it basically
says Open Menu.

656
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,710
You tap that, it exposes
the navigation.

657
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,830
And then is says, Close Menu.

658
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,330
So again, that's a pretty good
way of keeping things

659
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,141
accessible, yet still
unobtrusive.

660
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:26,239
So definitely a step in the
right direction for him.

661
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,070
Another interaction that doesn't
really get talked

662
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,960
about a lot is that
of scrolling.

663
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,900

664
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,239
It's a pretty common
interaction, obviously. .

665
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,719
But it's also not terribly
sexy to talk about.

666
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:45,980
But what I found is that
whenever we scroll on mobile,

667
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,679
whether on the web or just
anywhere else in apps or

668
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:54,310
whatever, we're typically doing
one of three things.

669
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,480
We're either going
back in time.

670
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,740
We're going through a Facebook
feed or an email feed or some

671
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,020
form of time-based grouping
of items.

672
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,430
We're going through grouped
items or we're diving in deep

673
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,640
into content.

674
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,250
So again, so we have things
like going back in time.

675
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,810
You're scrolling back in time
through your posts, through

676
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:18,550
your email, through whatever.

677
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:23,990
Going through groups of items,
things like categories of

678
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,280
names and stuff like that.

679
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,540
So I'm going through my contact
lists on my phone, or

680
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,080
I'm going through an artist's
list in iTunes, or Rdio, or

681
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,200
something like that.

682
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,160
Or I'm diving in deep into a
single piece of content.

683
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,450
I'm reading my email and this
Nigerian prince email looks

684
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,260
very attractive to me, so
I want to learn more.

685
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,230
So I'm going to scroll down.

686
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,160
Or I'm reading a really great
article on the web and so I'm

687
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,690
going to scroll down
to read it.

688
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,360

689
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,920
So what I've found though, is
that we're always scrolling

690
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,160
through a singular
content type.

691
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,900
This is important for responsive
design because so

692
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,570
much of responsive design
is how to &mdash;

693
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,060
the conversation is about
how to re-flow layouts.

694
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,740
What do we do with those second
and third and fourth

695
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,740
columns and stuff?

696
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,080
And typically, the answer
is to simply stack them

697
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,590
underneath each other.

698
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,460
And what I found is that that
just doesn't make for a very

699
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,210
good user experience.

700
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,855
So if you look again,
here's Mitt

701
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:33,550
Romney's site on the left.

702
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,860
And here's a previous version of
Obama's site on the right.

703
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,910
And you can see you have this
sort of big call out, this

704
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,550
Obama, Clooney, and you.

705
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,290
You have an email
sign-up form.

706
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:50,650
You have a couple touts that
highlight certain things.

707
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,210
You have his record in brief.

708
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,290
And then, as you scroll down &mdash;

709
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,540
sorry about that.

710
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,410

711
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,990
Oh, doesn't seem to work.

712
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,860
But as you scroll down
this page, you

713
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,830
have all of this stuff.

714
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,170
You have the record in brief.

715
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,210
Then you get down to
his blog posts.

716
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,240
And you see the blog posts and
you see all these share icons

717
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,530
for each blog posts.

718
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,870
And it goes through about
10 different blog posts.

719
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,770
And then underneath,
there's a bunch of

720
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,150
things like his tweets.

721
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,420
And then underneath that,
it's like take action.

722
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,710
And then underneath that,
it's even more stuff.

723
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,190
And then eventually, you get
down to the footer where it

724
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,305
just contains this huge
spray of links.

725
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:32,520
And the idea is that you're
simply sifting through all of

726
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,560
this disparate content just to
find what you're looking for.

727
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,480
It's not a very good
user experience.

728
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,040
Again, like the user expectation
on a mobile device

729
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,200
is to scroll through a
single content type.

730
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,450
And by simply stacking things
on top of each other, users

731
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,890
are forced to go on a treasure
hunt just to find what they're

732
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,730
looking for.

733
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,820
So we want to avoid that.

734
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,990
And if we look at Obama's
redesigned website, they've

735
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,900
done some sort of clever
optimization where basically

736
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,980
on small screens they just
exposed the title of their

737
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,930
blog posts instead of showing
the full excerpts, and all

738
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,140
these images, and all
these share buttons

739
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,070
in addition to them.

740
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,280
So that creates a more scannable
experience a better

741
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,550
performing experience, and
all of that stuff.

742
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,040
So definitely a step in
the right direction.

743
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,190
Conditional loading is sort of
what we're talking about with

744
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,710
regards to how to solve
those problems.

745
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,900
How do we include a full
experience, especially for

746
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:45,290
larger screens, but still keep
things nice and compact and

747
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,960
fast-loading right out of the
gate for small mobile screens?

748
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,680
Scott Jehl calls this aggressive
enhancement.

749
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,860
I really love that term.

750
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,430
I hope it catches on.

751
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,740
But basically, the
idea is this.

752
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,970
We have a web page.

753
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,130
This could be any web page.

754
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,010
We have the thing.

755
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,870
And the thing is the thing
that's divined by the URI.

756
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,750
If you click on a picture that
says Click Here for Cute

757
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,420
Kittens, whenever you click
on that link, what do

758
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,680
you expect to find?

759
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,020
You expect to find
cute kittens.

760
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,500
But in addition to those
pictures of cute kittens,

761
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,420
there's all this other stuff.

762
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,070
We might have related pictures
of cute kittens.

763
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,790
We might have a comment form.

764
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:30,410
We might have social icons
to share the thing.

765
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,770
But all of those things aren't
the pictures of cute kittens

766
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,460
themselves.

767
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,200
So what we could do is
we can actually chunk

768
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,270
those things out.

769
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,290
Those sort of supplemental
or [INAUDIBLE]

770
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,760
bits, which actually,
again, might &mdash;

771
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,160
they might not all be crap.

772
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,890
It's not like you could just
remove them entirely.

773
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,330
But we can just be a little
more thoughtful of how we

774
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,920
introduce them into
the experience.

775
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,930
So what we could do is we could
simply chunk those out,

776
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,580
link to them from
the main page.

777
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:07,400
So link to the comments and
have them isolated.

778
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,320
So again, if JavaScript fails,
or when it fails, the user can

779
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,740
click Click Here to
View Comments.

780
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,100
And they tap that, and then
they get taken to the new

781
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,140
screen that shows
the comments.

782
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,740
So again, the idea is to
create an accessible

783
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,750
experience.

784
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,390
But then from there, we could
sort of pull everything

785
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,990
together, like Voltron when
the conditions are right.

786
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,740
Whenever the screen's large
enough to accommodate those

787
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,670
extra chunks.

788
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,650
Or whenever the user
requests them.

789
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,580
We could sort of just pull
everything all together.

790
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,520
I think that's a really, really
valuable technique that

791
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,770
we have at our disposal to sort
of help keep the core

792
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:53,010
experience really, really light,
but also not sort of

793
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:59,000
sacrifice serving up an
eventual robust web

794
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,470
experience.

795
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,190
So the next thing we're going to
talk about is performance.

796
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,550
Performance is, in my opinion,
very neglected.

797
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,450
And the expectations are high.

798
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:17,100
Mobile users expect mobile sites
to load as fast, if not

799
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,580
faster, than desktop sites.

800
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,020
And that's a pretty huge
majority there, 71%.

801
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,850
And a full 74% of mobile
visitors will abandon a site

802
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,240
if it takes more than
5 seconds to load.

803
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,330
That's a huge number,
a full 3/4.

804
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,830
So in other words really,
you have 5 seconds

805
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,960
of someone's time.

806
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,790
And if you don't give them
something in that 5 seconds,

807
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,800
they're gone.

808
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,550
And they'll oftentimes go
to a competitor's site.

809
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,680
And they will be gone
and never come back.

810
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,420
But the problem is, is that
the average page size just

811
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,740
keeps growing and keeps growing,
growing more obese

812
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,340
every single day.

813
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,300
Why is this happening?

814
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,130
What I found is that just
performance is invisible.

815
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,710
It's the sort of invisible
aspect of design.

816
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,750
You can't mock up performance
in Photoshop.

817
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,880
You can't sort of just put
it there as a line

818
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,070
item on your thing &mdash;

819
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,320
performance.

820
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,200

821
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,550
It's often this thing
that's just &mdash;

822
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,780
it's always there, but it's
always neglected.

823
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,360
So because of that, I've been
talking about elevating

824
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,420
performance as a design
feature rather than as

825
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,880
something that only developers
need to worry about.

826
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,700
Because very often &mdash; and this
will probably sound familiar

827
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,910
to you, performance is
usually one of the

828
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,860
sort of lesser concerns.

829
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,460
Deadline's getting closer.

830
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,250
We don't really have a
whole lot of time.

831
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,090
It's like, oh, yeah.

832
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,990
We'll just worry about
all those performance

833
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,320
optimizations later.

834
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,630
Don't worry about it.

835
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,250
We just need to get
the site launched.

836
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,060
And, oh, that's just something
that the developers need to

837
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,930
take care of.

838
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,800
If the site's slow, it's
the developer's fault.

839
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,210
It's not the fact that they've
designed 30 meg images and

840
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,700
included a bunch of crazy
parallax stuff.

841
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,380
So I've been talking about
performance as design.

842
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,740
We need to elevate it earlier
in the design process.

843
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,980
You can't just leave it at
the end of the process.

844
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,450
If you don't think that
performance is important, it's

845
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,450
important to understand that
performance is good design.

846
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,270
Good performance
is good design.

847
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,170
If you don't believe me,
just look at the

848
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,420
whole Facebook thing.

849
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,460

850
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,090
I had a lot of people &mdash; and
whenever I mention that I work

851
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:45,690
in mobile, people would say,
Facebook suck, as if it was my

852
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,210
fault or something.

853
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:52,310
But they weren't saying that
Facebook sucks because the

854
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,480
navigation was unintuitive, or
that the timeline redesign

855
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,300
wasn't elegant, or that the
navigation wasn't cool.

856
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,520
They were saying it sucks
because it was just so slow.

857
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,660
So we really need to prioritize
performance in this

858
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,760
day and age.

859
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,450
We can't just sort of cross our
fingers and hope that 4G

860
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,390
and LTE and everyone's just
going to be rocking a FiOS

861
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,010
connection anytime soon.

862
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,680
We really can't bank on that.

863
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,090
We need to address the
constraints of bandwidth.

864
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:32,370
So if we look at how the
candidates fared, this is

865
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:38,770
typical web page on Romney's
site, the Pennsylvania page.

866
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,570
And I ran it through a
tool, which at the

867
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,530
time was called Blaze.io.

868
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,190
It's since been renamed, and
we'll get to that in a minute.

869
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:51,250
And what I found is that the
mobile site took 8.75 seconds

870
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:56,290
to load and weighed
687K, which is

871
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,620
actually pretty decent.

872
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,645
It's still above that 5 second
mark that we'd like to see.

873
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:06,680
But at the same time, the file
size is significantly lighter

874
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,780
than the average page weight.

875
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,980
Then we get over to the
responsive end of things.

876
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,420
Guy Podjarny, who helped make
Blaze.io, which is now

877
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:22,610
Mobitest, now works at Akamai,
found that 86% of responsive

878
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:27,150
websites serve the same payload,
or roughly the same

879
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,630
payload, to small screen
viewers as

880
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,510
large screen viewers.

881
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:35,760
So in other words, all these
mobile sites are basically

882
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,170
getting a desktop heavy
experience.

883
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,150
And so that's definitely
reflected in

884
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,920
Barack Obama's website.

885
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,730
This is again, a previous
edition of it.

886
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:51,420
And we ran it through the same
test and found that it takes

887
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:57,860
21.68 seconds to load and
weighed 3 and 1/2 megs, which

888
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,110
is gigantic.

889
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,010

890
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,480
And that actually creates some
serious accessibility issues.

891
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,970
My cousin, who's a geologist,
has a company-issued

892
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:11,710
BlackBerry.

893
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,600
And I asked him to fire up
Obama's website on his

894
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,180
BlackBerry.

895
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,670
And this is what he
sent back to me.

896
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,750
It said, request entity
too large.

897
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,990
In other words, it's saying, I'm
not even going to try to

898
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,860
render that page.

899
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,430
It's just way too big.

900
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:31,660
And it's funny to point out
that Obama actually has a

901
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,370
Blackberry.

902
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,340
So I was sort of curious to see
if Obama could access his

903
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,390
own website from his phone.

904
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,190
Hopefully he can.

905
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,295
But if you look at the waterfall
charts, on the left

906
00:46:44,295 --> 00:46:45,310
is Mitt Romney.

907
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,500
On the right is Obama.

908
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,870
You could just clearly see that
Obama's site is loading

909
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,120
way more stuff.

910
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,890

911
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,330
Through the course of the
campaign, they both underwent

912
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,470
some pretty serious redesigns.

913
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:06,850
So I ran both of the redesigns
through the updated tool,

914
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:10,330
which is again, called
Mobitest by Akamai.

915
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,450
And basically, it fires up &mdash;

916
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,470
you could paste in any URL.

917
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:20,110
It will fire it up on a real
device and then spit back the

918
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,110
performance stats for it.

919
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:27,580
So how long it takes to load,
what the page size is, and all

920
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,650
the waterfall charts.

921
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,640
And you can provide some
screenshots and stuff.

922
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,990
It's a great, great tool.

923
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:37,770
So I ran Mitt Romney's website
through this tool and found

924
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:42,500
that it actually now takes 19.58
seconds to load and now

925
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:47,370
their mobile site weighs
1.6megs, which is giant.

926
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:50,690
Once upon a time it was sitting
around, like 8 seconds

927
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,640
to load and 687K.

928
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,410
And now it's huge and
it's bloated.

929
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:59,880
Now granted, they are
achieving content

930
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,860
parity a lot more.

931
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,940
But it's a serious step
backwards for them as far as

932
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,460
performance goes.

933
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:13,040
And if we look at Obama's
website, their redesign

934
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,410
actually came down quite
a bit in file size.

935
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:21,010
It used to be 3 and 1/2 megs and
they cut it down to a meg.

936
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,940
It's still on the heavier side
of things, and it still takes

937
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,670
18.76 seconds to load.

938
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,170
But at the same time, that's
a pretty big step

939
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,420
in the right direction.

940
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,720
So performance is absolutely
essential.

941
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,980
I think that we need to sort
of elevate its status.

942
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,380
We need to treat it as more
of an urgent matter.

943
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,640
Treat it as a design
problem rather than

944
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,480
a development problem.

945
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,990
I think that does a lot of good
as far as getting more

946
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,080
people on board.

947
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,230
Just include that in your
statements of work and in your

948
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,070
project briefs and stuff.

949
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:01,000
Just say the goal is to create
a really fast website that's

950
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,970
very flexible.

951
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:07,620
So the last little bit of the
pyramid is this concept of

952
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,870
enhancement.

953
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,930

954
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,970
Progressive enhancement
is your friend.

955
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:20,190
Just because we have more
limited devices, or legacy

956
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,030
browsers, or whatever, doesn't
mean that we can't capitalize

957
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,860
on all the new and great
features that are coming down

958
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,800
the pipes really fast
and furious.

959
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,960
But in order to do this, we need
to build up from a core

960
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,620
experience.

961
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,880
We need to embrace the
constraints first, address

962
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,940
those constraints first,
and build up.

963
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,205
You hear the term mobile
first a lot.

964
00:49:42,205 --> 00:49:47,990
And really, from a development
standpoint, it's about sort of

965
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,090
addressing the constraints
of the mobile medium &mdash;

966
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:56,870
low bandwidth, small
resolutions, potentially

967
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:00,100
inferior feature sets,
and stuff like that.

968
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,900
And really just sort of build
up those experiences so that

969
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:09,530
as devices have more screen real
estate, as devices have

970
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:14,110
more capabilities, we're in a
position where we could simply

971
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:18,130
add it onto a core experience
in order to capitalize on

972
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,140
those features.

973
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,170
Instead of sort of assuming
things by default &mdash; oh, of

974
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,980
course users are on a large
screen or of course users

975
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,230
support touch.

976
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:29,030
Or of course users whatever.

977
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:32,260
All of a sudden you have to
cross your fingers and hope

978
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,050
that nobody releases a
popular device that

979
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:36,850
doesn't meet those criteria.

980
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,310
So it's really, really important
to progressively

981
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:44,250
enhance experiences now
more than ever.

982
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,010
And really, what I say is that
this is foundational work.

983
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:52,910
Jeremy Keith wonderfully stated,
he said, starting with

984
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,070
the lowest common
denominator &mdash;

985
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:59,390
or progressive enhancement
doesn't mean designing for the

986
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,480
lowest common denominator.

987
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,010
It means starting there.

988
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:03,880
I think that there is.

989
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,270
There's a misconception that
if you want to do anything

990
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:09,770
advanced or whatever, you have
to ignore progressive

991
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:10,320
enhancement.

992
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,940
That's simply not the case.

993
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,440
It's just a matter of laying a
solid foundation and covering

994
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,890
your bases, and then building
up from there.

995
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,810
Again, we have tools like
Modernizr, that gives us all

996
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,680
sorts of different things
that we could detect and

997
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,610
capitalize on them.

998
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:29,460
Introduce more advanced
functionality if a device

999
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,290
supports geolocation, if the
device supports App Cache, or

1000
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,120
WebSockets, or whatever.

1001
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,780
We actually have these tools
on the server side.

1002
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:43,790
This is Detector by Dave Olsen,
which actually is sort

1003
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:48,050
of a combination user
agent/feature detection tool

1004
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,210
that all gets handled on the
server end of things.

1005
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,010
So again, it doesn't all need
to be client side when we're

1006
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,320
doing this adaptation.

1007
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,030
But the idea is to really
capitalize on the specific

1008
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,370
device that's accessing
your experience.

1009
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,330
And it's also important to
understand that different

1010
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,870
users have different
expectations.

1011
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:13,700
My cousin's BlackBerry, he's
not expecting this crazy

1012
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:18,190
multi-touch CSS3 transition
web experience.

1013
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:21,650
He's really just trying to
access some information, and

1014
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,460
read some things, and
maybe fill out of

1015
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,980
form or two, or whatever.

1016
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,950
But he understands that he
doesn't have the latest and

1017
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,160
greatest Android device or the
latest and greatest iPhone.

1018
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,810

1019
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,400
Whenever you make these stupid
assumptions, you

1020
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,900
start looking silly.

1021
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,680
"Fatal Error.

1022
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,850
No iPhone, iPad, HTML5 images
available." I honestly don't

1023
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,100
really know what that means.

1024
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,270

1025
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:53,900
But yeah, you're depriving
people an experience

1026
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:58,000
arbitrarily is what's
going on here.

1027
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,070
It's also important to
understand that there's a

1028
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:03,560
difference between support
and optimization.

1029
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,310
Unless you wanted to hole
yourself up in a cabin for the

1030
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,400
foreseeable future with a bunch
of different devices,

1031
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,230
there's no way you're going to
be able to optimize for every

1032
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:17,190
single platform and
configuration and user

1033
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,900
preference and setting
out there.

1034
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:24,060
So you do, you need to draw a
line between what you support

1035
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,580
and what you optimize for.

1036
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,730
And it's important to understand
that difference,

1037
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:33,420
just because I think a
lot of people use &mdash;

1038
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,350
they sort of misconstrue
what optimization or

1039
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:37,940
what support means.

1040
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,160
And they say, well, we only
want to support WebKit

1041
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,720
browsers, or we only want to
support the iPhone, and

1042
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,520
everything else can
take a hike.

1043
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,290
There's still a way to
optimize for iPhone.

1044
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,130
There's still a way to optimize
for the best of breed

1045
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:57,140
and most capable devices while
still providing some level of

1046
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:01,280
support for those other users.

1047
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,720
Just because you don't like
their configuration or

1048
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,120
whatever, or it's a pain in the
ass to develop for doesn't

1049
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,110
mean we have the right to
arbitrarily lock them out of

1050
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,950
an experience.

1051
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:19,820
So there's a lot of different
things that we could enhance.

1052
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,570
This is the candidate's
website.

1053
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:25,280
You have all these opportunities
to utilize

1054
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,260
things like the right input
types for forms.

1055
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:34,090
So here we have a zip code on
both Mitt Romney's site and

1056
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:35,240
Obama's site.

1057
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,420
And what they could do is define
these things as numeric

1058
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,250
inputs that allow &mdash;

1059
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,940
that pull up the right virtual
keyboard on touch devices.

1060
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,230
That makes the form
a little easier to

1061
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:52,870
load or to get through.

1062
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:58,300
Here we have the newsletter
site on Obama's site.

1063
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,400
And you're looking at
the email field will

1064
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,830
actually pull up &mdash;

1065
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,180
so they did that one right.

1066
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:08,180
So they did input type
equals email.

1067
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,000
And it pulls up the
little at sign.

1068
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,830
It gets rid of these other
unnecessary characters, so it

1069
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,760
makes it a little
more easy to do.

1070
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,520
But then you go down into the
ZIP field and that should be a

1071
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,640
numeric value.

1072
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,100
And it's not.

1073
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:27,190
So there's a lot of different
things that we could do.

1074
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,330
One of which is, again, changing
the input type to

1075
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,870
number, which is great.

1076
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:37,060
But then, also adding this
pattern attribute to the

1077
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:41,490
string, which basically pulls
up the bigger chunkier

1078
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,550
telephone prompt.

1079
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:47,560
So instead of just having the
numbers 1 through 10 across

1080
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,420
the top like the previous
screen &mdash;

1081
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,030
oh, sorry.

1082
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,250
I don't have an example
of that.

1083
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,410
You instead get these
big, huge, chunky

1084
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,930
keys, which is fantastic.

1085
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:04,140
Another optimization that's
really important to understand

1086
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,950
is that these telephones in
which we're accessing the web

1087
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,560
can make telephone calls.

1088
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,260
And Obama's website is actually

1089
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,520
using this to his advantage.

1090
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,280
So they have this Call Tool
where people are able to make

1091
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,410
calls on the candidate's
behalf and say,

1092
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,260
hey, are you voting?

1093
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,610
Are you registered to vote?

1094
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,580
Who are you voting for?

1095
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,160
And give their whole spiel.

1096
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:34,180
Basically, from an old school
standpoint, you would have to

1097
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:39,460
look at the screen and then dial
a phone number on another

1098
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:43,520
device, which is hugely
cumbersome, takes a lot of

1099
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,050
time, and there's a lot
of room for error.

1100
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,370
But again, these mobile devices
can make phone calls

1101
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,325
right from the device.

1102
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:54,320
So the user can be on Obama's
website, simply tap that

1103
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,570
number, and initiate
a phone call.

1104
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,980
That's really, really clever.

1105
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:03,670
Other things for the candidates,
like geolocation

1106
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,120
is really, really important.

1107
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,660
Things that battleground states
and location matters a

1108
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:09,990
great deal.

1109
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:13,590
But there is ultimately just
all sorts of things that we

1110
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,330
can enhance.

1111
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,460
Again, if we look at that
list from Modernizr.

1112
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,200
It's a pretty extensive list.

1113
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,550
And this is just
the beginning.

1114
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,740
So wrapping up.

1115
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:30,860
This is what I want you to get
out of this, is that users

1116
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,910
don't give a shit if your
site is responsive.

1117
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:36,850
They don't give a shit if it's
a separate mobile site.

1118
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:39,810
They do give a shit when they
can't get done what they need

1119
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:41,150
to get done.

1120
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:44,440
Whenever they can't accomplish
their task is when they start

1121
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,380
noticing what environment
they're in.

1122
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:52,210
There's all of these different
things that we need to take

1123
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,030
into mind whenever we're
creating these multi-device

1124
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:56,650
web experiences.

1125
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:01,430
And it's just important to focus
on the right aspects of

1126
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,050
the process.

1127
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,620
And it's important
to understand &mdash;

1128
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,700
I took a lot of shots at the
candidates' websites, and on

1129
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,330
other sites and stuff as well.

1130
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,370
But this stuff is really,
really hard.

1131
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:17,180
We're all trying to
figure this out.

1132
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,620
It's important to
start somewhere.

1133
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,210
You might have a current desktop
site that's big and

1134
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:28,470
clunky and crusty and old, but
it's just out of the question

1135
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:31,350
to do a full-blown redesign.

1136
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:34,430
So these separate mobile sites,
while they might be

1137
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:37,850
sort of shortsighted in the near
term, can be a tremendous

1138
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:42,370
opportunity to help you sort of
evolve out from under your

1139
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:45,300
old legacy desktop site.

1140
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:50,360
So while a mobile site might be
initially limited as far as

1141
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,120
its content goes, as far as its
functionality goes, and

1142
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,470
stuff like that, you can still
plant the seed for a

1143
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:59,140
responsive future.

1144
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:04,040
And that's exactly what a lot
of organizations are doing.

1145
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,410
And eventually, you put time.

1146
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,060
You put effort into it.

1147
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,940
And ultimately, you can sort
of evolve out of your old

1148
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:15,900
crusty desktop site and into
this new global site that's

1149
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,390
mobile first built.

1150
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,310
It's adaptive.

1151
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:20,250
It's future-friendly.

1152
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,900
That's exactly what
organizations like the BBC are

1153
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,960
doing, like "People"
magazine are doing,

1154
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,160
and stuff like that.

1155
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,910
It just doesn't make sense for
them to strip away their old

1156
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,680
desktop site just yet.

1157
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,810
But at the same time,
they're learning how

1158
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,000
to deal with diversity.

1159
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,220
They're learning all the quirks
and the tricks of the

1160
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,480
trade with regards to
the mobile web.

1161
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,820
The takeaway from that is
to just start somewhere.

1162
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,990
Even if you don't fundamentally
agree with

1163
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:55,210
creating separate mobile sites,
that's OK as long as

1164
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:58,980
you're planning on sort of
treating it as a stepping

1165
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,010
stone for future enhancements.

1166
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:06,000
And again, this stuff is
really, really hard.

1167
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,920
And there's a lot to
learn from a lot

1168
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,840
of different people.

1169
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:13,380
So it's really important to not
get hung up in specific

1170
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,060
implementations and technique.

1171
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,320
I think that we need to sort
of stand together on

1172
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,880
principles that we could
all agree on.

1173
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,370
We all believe in the web.

1174
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:26,170
I like to say, this ain't
religion, this is web design.

1175
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:31,290
So be willing to abandon a best
practice that you've been

1176
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:35,410
using your whole career whenever
you find evidence

1177
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,610
that it makes sense
to abandon.

1178
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,750
I really like this quote
from Benjamin Franklin.

1179
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,530
He says, "Whenever you're
finished changing, you're

1180
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:47,270
finished." And that means we
can't get hung up in our ways.

1181
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,950
We can't get religious about
certain techniques and say,

1182
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,790
this is the one right
way to do things.

1183
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:56,220
We need to constantly
be evolving.

1184
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,690
Again, if you think of all the
different devices that are

1185
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:02,800
coming out just in the last
couple months, we need to be

1186
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,430
evolving right there
with them.

1187
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:09,030
Because the minute we
don't, the minute we

1188
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:11,490
put the web at risk.

1189
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:12,670
And let's face it, this
is going to be

1190
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,330
really, really fun.

1191
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:19,250
I can't think of a better
problem to help someone then

1192
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,540
determining who the web can
reach, what it can do, where

1193
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,310
it can go, how it gets used,
and why is still matters.

1194
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:30,790
I think that's a tremendous
problem to have and just a

1195
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:33,200
really, really fun problem
to help solve.

1196
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:39,000
So with that, I would
like to say, I kept

1197
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,620
politics out of this.

1198
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:45,700
But I did cast my vote for the
candidate that I thought had

1199
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:46,810
the best website.

1200
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:50,890
And that is why I voted for
Jimmy McMillan's "The Rent is

1201
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,520
too Damn High" party.

1202
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:57,180
It's ample use of Comic Sans,
and loud borders, and animated

1203
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,060
GIFs, it won me over.

1204
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,870
So I had to vote for him.

1205
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:07,970
I might have to change that to
2016, but I hope him and his

1206
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:10,600
awesome website is
in our future.

1207
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,870
So thanks very much, guys,
for listening.

1208
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,360
Sorry for the technical
difficulties.

1209
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,570
And hopefully we can take a look
at some questions now.

1210
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,600
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

1211
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,890
So Brad, if you want to come
off screen-sharing and I'll

1212
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:27,410
bring us up so that they
can see us both.

1213
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,380
So one of the first questions
that we have that's got a lot

1214
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:34,200
of votes, "When creating a
responsive sight, is it the

1215
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,730
best practice to define media
queries in pixels or Ems And

1216
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:42,040
are their pros and cons to
consider when using each of

1217
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,950
those?"

1218
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:47,530
BRAD FROST: Yeah, so there's
definitely advantages to

1219
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:52,930
defining your media queries in
relative units, like Ems.

1220
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:58,630
Lyza Danger Gardner of Cloud
Four wrote about this, about

1221
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:05,290
basically how proportional media
queries are a lot more

1222
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,200
future-friendly.

1223
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,780
But also, present-friendly.

1224
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:12,230
So in my experience,
I have seen pixel

1225
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:16,020
widths sort of destroyed.

1226
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,030
So a lot of different devices
handle pixels in a lot of

1227
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:20,110
different ways.

1228
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:23,890
16 pixels on a certain device
might look totally different

1229
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:27,020
than 16 pixels elsewhere.

1230
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:31,730
But also, user zoom settings
are really important.

1231
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:37,530
If I go into a responsive
website and command + +,

1232
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:41,110
magnify the site, which I
like to do actually &mdash;

1233
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:47,320
if your media queries are set in
pixels, it won't honor the

1234
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,530
user zoom settings.

1235
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:53,340
But if you handle them with
relative units using Ems, it

1236
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,770
will honor them.

1237
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,830
I think it requires
a page refresh.

1238
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:59,670
But at the same time, it
will re-flow the layout

1239
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:04,490
appropriately if you use
proportional media queries.

1240
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:07,390
And the other thing that's worth
stating is that we're

1241
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:10,710
using proportional units for
everything else now.

1242
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:11,530
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah,
that's true.

1243
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:14,580
BRAD FROST: For layouts, for
fonts, for everything now.

1244
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,030
Just take it that one step
further and define your break

1245
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:20,630
points in relative units.

1246
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:20,900
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

1247
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,520
So next question from Dan in
Amsterdam wants to know,

1248
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,900
"Should we take into account
a device bandwidth before

1249
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,720
serving content, especially
media assets to the device?

1250
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,750
If so, how should we
implement that?"

1251
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,740
BRAD FROST: Yeah, so there's a
lot of actually really recent

1252
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,630
things that have been coming up

1253
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:43,330
regarding sort of bandwidth.

1254
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:46,230
It's still really tricky
to detect bandwidth.

1255
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:49,560
We have sort of the navigation,
navigator

1256
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,590
connection type, and
stuff like that.

1257
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,090
But even that's not reliable.

1258
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:57,520
Anybody that's been on like
hotel Wi-Fi will probably know

1259
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:01,080
that 3G is oftentimes
faster than that.

1260
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,050
We can't make assumptions even
based on even knowing what

1261
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:07,240
kind of connection
type we have.

1262
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:14,230
So I'd say that it's best to
assume a slow, painfully slow

1263
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:19,960
connection by default and serve
up assets appropriately.

1264
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,520
Things like adaptive images &mdash;

1265
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,750
and there's a lot of different
solutions and stuff that's

1266
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,040
sort of coming down the pipes
with regards to the spec and

1267
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,460
stuff like that.

1268
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:35,240
But in the meantime, we have
tools like Picture Fill, which

1269
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:40,280
allows us to serve a small
image by default.

1270
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,690
But then whenever you reach
a certain break point or

1271
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:46,710
whatever, then load in
a larger image asset.

1272
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:49,510
Same thing with retina graphics
and stuff like that.

1273
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:53,620
Small by default, but then
conditionally load in a higher

1274
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,240
res version.

1275
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,390
But one of the most recent
things that has been pretty

1276
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:03,070
clever is that they're finding
that the image compression,

1277
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:08,620
like JPEG compression, is more
a factor in determining a

1278
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:09,980
device's bandwidth &mdash;

1279
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:16,020
or, I'm sorry, an image's size
than the dimensions of them.

1280
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:19,010
So everyone's freaking out about
retina screens and stuff

1281
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,190
like that now.

1282
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:23,930
And it's important to understand
that you could

1283
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:28,610
actually create larger images
with larger dimensions, but a

1284
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:32,240
lower compression and then just
simply scale them down

1285
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,110
and they'll look great on retina
displays, as well as

1286
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,810
just standard displays.

1287
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:43,300
And in some cases, the file
size of the enhanced &mdash;

1288
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:43,870
the bigger &mdash;

1289
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:45,600
PETE LEPAGE: Is even smaller.

1290
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,460
BRAD FROST: Even smaller than
the base image, which is

1291
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,410
pretty crazy.

1292
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:56,660
But yeah, image optimization,
other things like maps and

1293
01:06:56,660 --> 01:07:01,180
other interactive components,
just don't include those

1294
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,310
things by default.

1295
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,390
Again, I was talking about
conditionally loading.

1296
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:07,440
I will give my little example.

1297
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,870
I have a demo of this
on the way.

1298
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:12,940
Hopefully I can share
it later on &mdash;

1299
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:15,140
of something like Google Maps.

1300
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:19,790
If you want to embed Google Maps
in your site, you have to

1301
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:22,240
iFrame in the embedded map.

1302
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,050
But for small screens, I would
actually argue that's not a

1303
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:26,750
very good experience.

1304
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:32,460
For one, a lot of major
smartphone platforms, like iOS

1305
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:38,710
and Android, will intercept
links to Google Maps and fire

1306
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:42,130
up the native mapping
application, which is a far

1307
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:44,670
better user experience
than anything

1308
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,840
on the web can provide.

1309
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,940
Again, it just has access
to more things.

1310
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,410
So I'd say that that's
the best experience.

1311
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:55,700
So the demo that I have
simply includes a

1312
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,420
link to Google Maps.

1313
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:03,900
And you could use the Google
Static Map API or whatever, to

1314
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:07,310
pull in a still or whatever,
if you want to.

1315
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:11,270
And then whenever the screen
size becomes big enough, then

1316
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:14,120
you can load in that iFrame and
add an editable map and

1317
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:14,880
stuff like that.

1318
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,560
So again, it's about sort of
serving the right experience

1319
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,210
to the right context
and stuff.

1320
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:24,090
But by assuming less upfront,
you're not forcing mobile

1321
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:28,700
users to download all this
JavaScript to render an iFrame

1322
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,850
by default.

1323
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:32,380
And as a result, you're able to
just sort of take bandwidth

1324
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:34,819
into consideration.

1325
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,880
At the very least, if everything
fails, they have a

1326
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,950
link to Google Maps, and I'd
trust Google Developers on the

1327
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:46,430
Maps mobile team more than me
to make sure that people can

1328
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:47,740
get to where they need to get.

1329
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:48,630
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

1330
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:49,160
Cool.

1331
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,140
Well, Brad, I think that's about
all the time that we

1332
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:51,990
have for today.

1333
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:53,970
I want to say thank you so
much for joining us.

1334
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,160
This was enlightening.

1335
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,040
This is the second time I've
seen this session and I

1336
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,450
learned stuff again
this second time.

1337
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:02,580
So I want to say thank
you very much.

1338
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:06,800
I want to invite all of our
viewers to join us in 3 weeks

1339
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,630
on December 5.

1340
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:11,420
We're going to have another
Chrome Mobile event where

1341
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:14,439
we'll be talking about some of
the tools that you can use as

1342
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:18,359
a developer building mobile
sites and mobile applications.

1343
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:19,850
So with that, thank you
guys very much.

1344
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,790
Brad, thank you.

1345
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:21,320
BRAD FROST: Cool.

1346
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,840
Thank you very much
for having me.

1347
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,529
Appreciate it.

1348
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:23,920
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

1349
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,920
Have a good day, everybody.

1350
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,859
BRAD FROST: All right,
take care.

1351
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:26,910
PETE LEPAGE: Bye.

1352
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:28,160
BRAD FROST: Bye.

1353
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:38,367
