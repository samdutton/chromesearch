00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,866

00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:02,600
MATT MCNEILL: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,080
I'm Matt.

4
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,260
This is Tom.

5
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,050
Welcome to the session, Here
Be BigQuery at I/O. Just

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,070
before I start, I've got a bit
of a confession to make.

7
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,650
I developed a bit of
an addiction over

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,360
the last six months.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,600
It started back in November, and
someone internally sent me

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,850
an email with an invitation
to "join the resistance."

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,515
For anyone who's played Ingress,
you all know what

12
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:28,200
that means.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,180
I've gone through about
two pairs of shoes.

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,410
I've walked more miles in the
last six months than I think

15
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,380
I've walked in the
last six years.

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,660
It's been a really interesting
experience, because it's

17
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,750
probably been one of the most
engaging, social, fun sort of

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,430
games I've played in years.

19
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,950
And I've been working a lot over
the last few months, few

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,110
years, in social gaming,
particularly working with some

21
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,000
big gaming customers
in Europe, Gamesys

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,190
being one of them.

23
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,310
And it really got me thinking,
how do you create that sort of

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,150
level of engagement in a game?

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,820
You look at a game
like Ingress &mdash;

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,380
how do you get that level
of addiction in a game?

27
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,250
So when I started looking at
this, you see these statistics

28
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,410
that actually have been around
for a couple of years.

29
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,950
But so many games that
developers are building, they

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,200
get installed once, and then
they're never played again.

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,070
Something like 25%.

32
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,590
And if you're writing a game,
the finances associated with

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,630
these &mdash; the real business
of a game &mdash;

34
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,940
is difficult.

35
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,030
An average game life cycle can
range between weeks and

36
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,640
months, but let's say
five or six weeks.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,970
When you're planning your
business, that's when you're

38
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,870
going to try to make
the money.

39
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,950
But if you can crack this
engagement problem, you can

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,450
start pushing out beyond that,
and everything that comes

41
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,490
after that is profit.

42
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,190
And that's important when you're
really in the business

43
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,090
of casual gaming.

44
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,730
So I started thinking about what
are some of the drivers

45
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,450
around this.

46
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,820
And one of the big trends
that I've seen come up &mdash;

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,750
and this is some basic research
I did on Google

48
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,180
Trends &mdash; was there's a big trend
coming up around social

49
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,160
gaming and the connected game.

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,170
Of course, if you don't have
a connected game, it's very

51
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,000
difficult to actually
make it social.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,930
A game back end enables that
social dimension to a game.

53
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,800
Ingress is a good example,
of course, in

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,830
quite an extreme way.

55
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,590
Though there's some other
drivers that came

56
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,630
out as well for that.

57
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,450
Second was &mdash; this surprised me,
actually &mdash; but a lot of

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,220
people are starting to create
connected games to push some

59
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,240
of their game logic out of the
client for piracy issues.

60
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,530
So there's a great story in
the press a few weeks ago,

61
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,050
where someone had built
a game simulation &mdash;

62
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,530
a simulation game of
a game company.

63
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,970
And what they were able to do
is detect whether the client

64
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,860
had been pirated or not.

65
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,770
And they played a bit of a
joke, and made sure that

66
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,060
anyone who'd pirated the game,
their company went bust.

67
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,940
The virtual company went bust
because of pirates.

68
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,110
And there were all these forums
online where people

69
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,630
were, oh my god, this
game's awful!

70
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,120
I keep getting done
by pirates!

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,380
Yes.

72
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,420
It was great.

73
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,990
And this is the sort
of fun that people

74
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,270
are starting to have.

75
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,800
But I think probably one of
the most important areas,

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,565
actually, comes out
of measurement.

77
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,390
If you've got a connected game,
you can start measuring

78
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,220
in a way that really has not
been possible before.

79
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,690
And I think one of the reasons
I was really keen on doing

80
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,130
this session is I think some of
the work that Tom's done in

81
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,140
Gamesys is some of the most
advanced work I've seen in

82
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,160
really developing this idea of
a science of engagement,

83
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,550
retention, and keeping those
users playing the game.

84
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,115
So I'm going to hand over at
this point, Tom Newton,

85
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:48,282
Director of Social
Gaming, Gamesys.

86
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:49,532
TOM NEWTON: Thanks, Matt.

87
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:52,855

88
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:54,530
Hi, everyone.

89
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,440
So as Matt's just introduced me,
my name's Tom Newton, and

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,960
I'm a director at Gamesys, and
I look after our social and

91
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,090
mobile games business.

92
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,430
So many of you probably have
never heard of Gamesys.

93
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,460
We were founded in 2001.

94
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,310
We're based in London,
in the UK.

95
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,200
We have relatively quickly grown
to be a market leader in

96
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,670
what is arguably the most
competitive online gaming

97
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,660
market in the world.

98
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,040
We currently have about $5
billion in turnover annually,

99
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,780
and I think this says a little
bit about the stature of the

100
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,800
company today.

101
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,280
We were the first company that
Facebook approached to launch

102
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,360
real money gaming on
Facebook last year.

103
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,840
And we've grown from about
10 people in 2011

104
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,170
to about 1,000 today.

105
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,815
We started investing
in social gaming &mdash;

106
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:47,290
social and mobile, really &mdash;

107
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,220
in 2011.

108
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,220
And we've grown that team
organically from, again, about

109
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,210
3 or 4 people to just
over 100 today.

110
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,870
We're currently operating five
cross-platform games &mdash;

111
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,620
so iOS, Android, and
on Facebook &mdash;

112
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,420
and we're even operating a game
for PopCap and Electronic

113
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,100
Arts, something we're
very proud of.

114
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,900
So today, really, we're just
going to talk about a couple

115
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,690
of the uses, particularly
within the social team.

116
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,390
How we use the Google
Cloud Platform.

117
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,150
I always have trouble
saying that.

118
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,880
So we're going to focus, really,
on cloud storage,

119
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,610
BigQuery, App Engine, and we're
going to talk a little

120
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,160
bit about the prediction
API as well, and how

121
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,810
we plan to use that.

122
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:37,330
So I get asked this a lot,
particularly by developers.

123
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,370
Why not build a cool
infrastructure?

124
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,480
Why not have big data
projects internally?

125
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,460
And I sort of say, we do, but we
use Google because we like

126
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,300
to focus on building products,
and trying to get away from

127
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,100
building infrastructures.

128
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,370
So really spending our time on
trying to make really, really,

129
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,220
really fantastic games and
products for our customers.

130
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,020
And so we can build with Google
because we always plan

131
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,270
for success, and success
means that we're

132
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,050
going to need to scale.

133
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,190
And obviously, Google are an
expert in building excellent

134
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,650
scalable services.

135
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,040
We really love all
the Google APIs.

136
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,570

137
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,350
Doing an integration with one
of these Google services

138
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,450
really means that through
these rich APIs, you can

139
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,260
really use them as just a
building block, and build a

140
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,000
lot of interesting tools
around them.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,320
And that's something that I
think gives you a lot of

142
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,420
synergies when you start to
integrate your own systems

143
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,190
with the Google Cloud
Platform.

144
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,690
And third, it's reliable.

145
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,370
I think the less software that
I need to run and to maintain

146
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,850
and to monitor, the better.

147
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,850
I'd just like to
sleep at night.

148
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,490
Call me lazy, but
I enjoy sleep.

149
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,460
And when we use Google Cloud
Platform, we just, for the

150
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,670
most part, don't need
to worry about it.

151
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,850
We can trust that it's
going to do its job.

152
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,290
So today, we're going to tell
you a little bit about a new

153
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,030
game that we have, and that's
really just to paint a picture

154
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,510
of what these connected products
look like &mdash; these

155
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,080
connected games &mdash;

156
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,510
how they work.

157
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,730
We're going to talk a lot about
the importance of data.

158
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,300
And then we're going to move on
to talk a little bit about

159
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,290
how we industrialize the
learnings that we get from

160
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,010
this data, and build
tools that help

161
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,870
us operate our business.

162
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,530
So "Here Be Monsters" is a
pretty ambitious project.

163
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,000
It started about a year
and a half ago.

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,860
It's a social game, but we're
trying to take it a little bit

165
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,010
of a step further and give
it a bit of an RPG feel.

166
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,520
So it's an online MMO, we're
building it for the web, and

167
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,510
we're also building it for
Android tablets and the iPad.

168
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,300
So it'll be launching on the
iPad first, and that should

169
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,640
come in about early September.

170
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,970
We're really excited about it.

171
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,850
So when it's out, definitely
check it out.

172
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,880
So in Here Be Monsters, you've
got an entire world.

173
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,020
It's an isometric 2D game.

174
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,770
You've got an entire world that
you can go and explore.

175
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,580
And currently, I think &mdash; we're
in beta right now &mdash; currently,

176
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,080
I think there's about 3,000 to
3,500 unique distinct objects

177
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,510
which exist within the game.

178
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,850
And so I think the point I'm
trying to make here is that

179
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,460
Here Be Monsters is all about
data, and we're just

180
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,580
constantly pushing new items
that the players can run

181
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,060
around the world and collect.

182
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,270
And once they do collect all
these items, they can combine

183
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,270
them in really interesting
ways to craft bigger and

184
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,370
better items.

185
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,049
So a very, very typical
kind of RPG mechanic.

186
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,400
And why do they want to go
around the world and collect

187
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,700
all these items and build all
these interesting things?

188
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,580
Well, they do it because they
want to catch monsters.

189
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,750
And in order to catch monsters,
there's a trapping

190
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,470
element to the game.

191
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,570
So you can build really, really
interesting traps.

192
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,050
You can travel around to the
right parts of the world.

193
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,660
You can put some bait
in your trap.

194
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,090
And then periodically, you'll
check your trap, and you're

195
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,150
hoping that you've caught the
monster that you're after.

196
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,640
So now I'll just show you really
quickly what the game

197
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,890
looks like.

198
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:08,730

199
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,100
So hopefully, you guys
can see this.

200
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,790
We had a little bit
of a problem

201
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,295
with the monitor earlier.

202
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:16,720
That looks good.

203
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,400
OK, so here's "Here Be
Monsters." That's my little

204
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,240
character there running
around.

205
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,810
You can see a trap that I've
set here which is actually

206
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,630
ready to check.

207
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,010
But the point that I'm trying to
make here is that the world

208
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:27,750
is really big.

209
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,720
This is just one isometric scene
that players can visit

210
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,750
and run around and
interact with.

211
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,960
And everything is interactive.

212
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,290
You can see a couple of players
down there, actually,

213
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,340
sort of standing around.

214
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
Some of them are probably
fishing.

215
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,690
I think we broke the game
recently, so you can't see the

216
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,070
fact that they're fishing.

217
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,380
But all of the elements
are interactive.

218
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,280
So they can go around and pick
up &mdash; for example, we can pick

219
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,360
up some grass or a dandelion.

220
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,040
We can go fishing.

221
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,660
There we go, we picked up some
grass and some dandelions.

222
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,090
We put those in our backpack.

223
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,600
And we can combine those.

224
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,900
Again, we can take them back
home, we can craft them into

225
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,370
bigger and better items, and we
can carry on with the game.

226
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,280
And the way that we lead players
through the game is

227
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,640
really through the
questing system.

228
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,680
So players travel around the
world, and they meet

229
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,690
non-player characters.

230
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,320
And when they meet those
non-player characters, they're

231
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,180
given all sorts of different
tasks that they need to do.

232
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,390
So they start off very, very
simple, and then they progress

233
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,600
and get more and more complex,
meaning that you really need

234
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,500
to get out there into the world,
find all these items,

235
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,080
discover them, and discover the
recipes on how you make

236
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,910
better and better items.

237
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,200
Just to give you a sense
of some of the

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,270
artwork in the world &mdash;

239
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,560
so this is the world.

240
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,120
It's a game that's based on the
real world, and it's full

241
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,220
of isometric scenes that
you can visit.

242
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,310
So if I zoom in, all of these
little icons here, they all

243
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,940
represent unique isometric 2D
scenes that players can visit,

244
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,660
and they're full of different
kinds of items.

245
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,450
There are different trees,
different butterflies,

246
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,920
different flowers.

247
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,270
And I think the coolest thing
about the game, too, is that

248
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,250
the monsters are actually
all taken

249
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,570
from real human mythology.

250
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,640
So if you wanted to find a
specific kind of monster that

251
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,070
you know about, chances are that
it's going to be in the

252
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,490
area that you would expect
it to be in.

253
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,210
But if you need to look
it up, you can

254
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,250
always go into the almanac.

255
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,860
I'll just show you
that as well.

256
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,330
So the almanac &mdash;

257
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,930
this is the dandelion pixie,
which is one of the nicer

258
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,460
looking monsters that you can
go out and try and catch.

259
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,170
But there's a lot of information
within the almanac

260
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,800
that tells you all about all
the different monsters.

261
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,735
For example, a chimera, which
is probably something that

262
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:29,140
some people are familiar with,
the different baits that you

263
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,750
might have to craft in
order to trap them.

264
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,320
So hopefully, this is kind of
making the point, there's a

265
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,310
ton of data in this game.

266
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,640
And the strategy behind this
game is that we built a really

267
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,770
interesting kind of CMS behind
the scenes that allows us to

268
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,460
push a lot of content on a
weekly basis, because we

269
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,550
expect that a lot of the most
engaged users are going to

270
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,070
tear through the content.

271
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,590
So it's very, very important
that if we want to keep them

272
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,370
engaged, we need to be
constantly releasing new and

273
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,880
better content for this game.

274
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:09,440

275
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,840
Great.

276
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,440
So, all right.

277
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,850
So we've sort of painted a
little bit of a picture.

278
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,790
We've got a lot of players,
they're running around,

279
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,060
they're doing all these
different activities.

280
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,530
They can visit friends, they can
send gifts, they can farm

281
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,660
on their homesteads, they
can craft items,

282
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,060
they can collect items.

283
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,210
So what does this mean?

284
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,520
Well, what it means is that we
generate a ton of events.

285
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,410
There's a lot of raw data,
and that raw data &mdash;

286
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,800
I'd say five or six years ago,
you probably wouldn't have

287
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,940
recorded every single little
step that a player made and

288
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,000
all of the different
properties that

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,870
go along with that.

290
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,470
But today, it's pretty much
a necessity if you want to

291
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,470
operate one of these games,
and you want to operate it

292
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,770
well and optimize it and run
it as a solid business.

293
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,930
But that means you're
going to generate a

294
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,600
huge amount of data.

295
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,610
And just to give you an idea of
the sorts of levels of data

296
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,800
that we see &mdash; and to be honest,
there are plenty of

297
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,090
other companies that are
probably generating

298
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,640
even more than this.

299
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,650
"Here Be Monsters" right now has
got about 10,000 people in

300
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,180
a limited beta on Facebook.

301
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,210
And those 10,000 players are
generating about a million

302
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,010
sessions a month, and
about 200 million

303
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,130
unique events a month.

304
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,670
So 200 million actions taken
by 10,000 daily actives.

305
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,300
We've got other games currently
that are running.

306
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,400
Game 2 there, launched about
three months ago, has already

307
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,620
got 150,000 people playing
it every day.

308
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,050
They're generating about
500 million events

309
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,380
every single month.

310
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,670
And then one of our larger games
is generating in the

311
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,196
billions of events
every month.

312
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:41,400

313
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,670
All of this data goes
into BigQuery.

314
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,450
And the reason why we really
like BigQuery at Gamesys is

315
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,810
that it's managed, so there's
almost nothing you need to do

316
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,790
to get set up.

317
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,230
It scales.

318
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,690
I'm going to say this
a lot today.

319
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,640
We really cannot integrate with
a service where we think

320
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,880
that it can't scale, and
BigQuery definitely has a lot

321
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,380
of power and can do the sorts
of things that we

322
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,180
want to do with it.

323
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,120
And then also the fact that
you're just writing SQL.

324
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,660
Anybody can write a BigQuery,
and that's pretty awesome,

325
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,870
because our analysts don't like
training days and this

326
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,120
sort of thing.

327
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,060
Because they already know SQL,
and they know it really well,

328
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,360
the transition is extremely easy
for them to go and start

329
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,185
writing big, powerful queries.

330
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:26,750

331
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,020
So to give you an idea of what
happens within our platform,

332
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,510
every day, we've got all these
players coming in, they're

333
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,460
playing the game, doing all
these different things, having

334
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,630
a lot of fun.

335
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,000
And at night, we aggregate all
of that events data into a

336
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,480
couple of aggregated tables
just for convenience.

337
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,920
And then we also upload all of
the raw events into a table

338
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,170
within BigQuery.

339
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,420

340
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,950
So these aggregations, these
aggregated tables, they're

341
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,780
there for convenience, but they
help us drive, really,

342
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,175
just high level KPI reporting.

343
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:07,000

344
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,490
Just to give you an idea of a
couple of the tables that we

345
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,290
use fairly consistently across
all of our games &mdash; and you may

346
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,470
want to define different ones
depending on the style of game

347
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,970
or application &mdash;

348
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,580
I mean, I think this applies to
really any digital product.

349
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,770
The first is profiles.

350
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,280
So profiles, when they're
aggregated at night, you get a

351
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,610
picture of what that user's
state looked like at the end

352
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,170
of the day, and that's
fairly important.

353
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,060
Sessions are fairly
self-explanatory.

354
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,690
They're essentially aggregated
groups of events that match a

355
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,510
user's play periods.

356
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,170
And then we have transactions.

357
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,650
So transactions, obviously,
are really important.

358
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,900
They drive the entire
business.

359
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,900
We want to know when did someone
make a purchase, very,

360
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,290
very specifically, so that we
can go and really dig into,

361
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,860
what motivated them to
make that purchase?

362
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,860
What did they do once they
bought that virtual currency

363
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,740
or virtual good?

364
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,390
How did they spend that
within the game?

365
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,670
What sort of activities did they
engage with afterwards?

366
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,630
It's really, really important
that we dig in and understand

367
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,180
the purchasing behavior and the
behavior of our players,

368
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,660
especially around the
time of purchase.

369
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,370

370
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,420
So hopefully, I've been able
to paint a little bit of a

371
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,600
picture about what the game
is, what kind of data it

372
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,510
generates, the volumes of data
that it generates, and that we

373
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,810
effectively every night update
a number of data sets and

374
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,590
tables within BigQuery.

375
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,150
So now that our data is in
BigQuery, and you understand

376
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,930
the structure of that data,
we're going to talk just a

377
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,170
little bit about how &mdash;

378
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,900
this is probably one of the
simplest things you can do, in

379
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,270
fact, once your data is in
BigQuery, and that is to

380
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,950
integrate that data
with spreadsheets.

381
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,050
So, to build, essentially,
reports of various shapes and

382
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,350
sizes using Apps Script.

383
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,650
This is incredibly easy to do.

384
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,180
So using some of those
aggregated tables, on our

385
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,319
teams, we build up dashboards.

386
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,960
So we build relatively
complicated workbooks that

387
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,640
everybody on the team
has access to.

388
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,560
We look at a lot of
different metrics.

389
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,420
We slice them in
different ways.

390
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,819
But probably the simplest
would be a simple daily

391
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:24,640
dashboard, and these really just
help to highlight high

392
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,270
level KPI trends.

393
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,770
And they often give you a bit
of a hint that just says,

394
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,150
maybe we want to go
and look at this.

395
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,940
Retention looks like it's a
little bit off for these

396
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,010
players, or something's
happened, and

397
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,270
our active user base &mdash;

398
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,050
the retention dropped over the
next week, and we want to

399
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,030
figure out why.

400
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,340
And other people may want
to look at things

401
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,170
like conversion rates.

402
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,320
So when we have brand new
installs coming in on a given

403
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,430
day or given week, we really
want to monitor the health of

404
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,400
those users, compare them to
other install days, other

405
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,520
install weeks, so that we feel
comfortable continuing with

406
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,770
our acquisition spend.

407
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,630

408
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,250
So now what I'll do is I'll just
show you very quickly for

409
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,550
the developers that are in the
room, of which I would imagine

410
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,980
there are lots of you, I'll just
show you how easy it is

411
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,900
to basically integrate BigQuery
with spreadsheets,

412
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,780
and to build reports this way.

413
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,670
So what I've done here is
I've just given you &mdash;

414
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,050
within our games, we tend to
have lots of different types

415
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,170
of funnels.

416
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,630
So funnels, really, are just
sequential events, and the

417
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,600
fact that we've got all this
raw events data in BigQuery

418
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,520
pretty much means we can define
any funnel we want.

419
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,510
And that's pretty significant,
and pretty powerful.

420
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,045
So let's just take this
as an example.

421
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:43,420
I've called it the elementary
quest funnel analysis.

422
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,340
But let's say we've got
a product manager.

423
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,280
This week, they're going to
focus on a very specific part

424
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,390
of the game.

425
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,420
They think they've seen
a bit of drop-off.

426
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,110
They've asked one of the
analysts to go away and do a

427
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,180
bit of ad hoc analysis.

428
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,500
They've identified the issue.

429
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,990
And now what they
want to see is.

430
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,140
As they make these iterations
daily, and they keep pushing

431
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,440
these releases, we want to get
that data in front of a

432
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,090
product manager.

433
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,060
And a product manager doesn't
necessarily know how to go

434
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,360
into BigQuery and write a bunch
of SQL, nor should they

435
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,440
have to, because our analysts
can simply create a new

436
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,860
workbook that's specifically
for that product manager,

437
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,450
define a query that can go away
and look at those tables,

438
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,570
pull out all the interesting
events that matter, and

439
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,170
summarize that into a sample
little dashboard.

440
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,170
So how do you do that?

441
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,100
Well, to be honest, I didn't
even know this stuff existed

442
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,840
about nine months ago until I
did a little bit of digging

443
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,860
around and had a few
chats with Matt.

444
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,610
But we've started using it
heavily, and it's fantastic.

445
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,070
So you need to go into the
script editor to start working

446
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,230
with Apps Script, and you'll
find it under the Tools menu.

447
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,890
So if you go to the Tools menu
and you go down here, this

448
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,510
script editor thing &mdash; if you've
ever wondered what that

449
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:54,090
is, well, for those you that are
new to Apps Script, that

450
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,180
will open the script editor.

451
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,840
And what you'll see here is
essentially JavaScript.

452
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,450
So Apps Script is basically
JavaScript.

453
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,420
And I'll just show you.

454
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:08,660
So this function here is just
a very simple function which

455
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,900
takes a query, which is just
our SQL statement.

456
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,090
I've put it in a comment down
here, just to illustrate the

457
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,100
complexity of the query.

458
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,460
So this is a big
complex query.

459
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:26,230
It's going query about 200
million rows of data, and it's

460
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,970
going to pull the results back,
and it's going to put

461
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,510
that into our spreadsheet.

462
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,490
So how do you connect to
BigQuery within Apps Script?

463
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,630
Well, it's actually
really simple.

464
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,270
So here's a little convenience
function that I wrote, which

465
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,370
is run query async, and it's
really just broken down into

466
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:41,940
three parts.

467
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,870
So you've got this job
description here, which is

468
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,820
very, very simple to set up.

469
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,550
And you can see that we're
passing in our SQL statements.

470
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,670
That's just a string that
represents our SQL statement.

471
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,920
You can then insert the job.

472
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,160
So again, very, very simple.

473
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,460
That's basically passing it off
to BigQuery and asking it

474
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,420
to actually execute the query.

475
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,580
And then all we do here
is we just wait.

476
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,690
We wait asynchronously,
and we pull to see

477
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,250
if the job is complete.

478
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,270
And then finally, when the
results come back, we go ahead

479
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:14,380
and fetch them just here,
and then we return them.

480
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,620
And that's essentially it.

481
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,230
So if we run that now,
hopefully this will &mdash;

482
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:21,640
oh, sorry.

483
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,680
This is one other thing you can
do, which is, again, for

484
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,760
convenience, is you can very
easily just add your own

485
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,440
custom menus.

486
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
So you can see this little
bit of code here.

487
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,980
That's all that does.

488
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,030
So I get a nice little menu
item here, and this button

489
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,540
here is hooked to my function.

490
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,930
Now, the other thing I'll
mention as well &mdash;

491
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,350
when you're building up, say,
daily dashboards or monthly

492
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,340
dashboards, a really nice,
simple way to get them to

493
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,730
automatically run every day
is with the triggers

494
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,360
functionality.

495
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,030
So this little icon here
is the triggers.

496
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,640
To set up a new periodic trigger
is extremely simple.

497
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,760
Just go here and add a trigger,
select the function

498
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,280
that you want to run, select
that you want it to be time

499
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,450
driven, and there's a bunch
of different options here.

500
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,410
So if this was a daily thing
that we wanted to refresh, I

501
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,150
would select daily, select the
time we want it to run &mdash; so

502
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,950
let's say we want it
to run at 6:00 AM.

503
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,685
We'd save that.

504
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:19,080
And now this spreadsheet's going
to automatically run

505
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,360
that query for you at between
6:00 and 7:00 AM.

506
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,320
And so when you get it in the
morning, just pop open your

507
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,400
workbook or open your phone, and
that funnel announcement

508
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,870
is right there for
you to look at.

509
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,300
So let's just run the
query very quickly.

510
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,870
Again, so this isn't a massive,
massive data set, but

511
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,170
it's pretty big.

512
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,270
And obviously, we're running
this for our other games as

513
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,955
well on much larger data sets.

514
00:22:39,955 --> 00:22:41,900
This is about 200
million rows.

515
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,470
So it's running, and
there we go.

516
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,770
So all of our interesting data
that we were interested in

517
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,400
about these different events
throughout our funnel, we've

518
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,160
tracked that, we split it by
Tier 1 countries and non-Tier

519
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,540
1, which is basically
English speaking

520
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,990
and not English speaking.

521
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,830
And we can see the results
visualized on our graph below.

522
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,560
So that's how easy it is,
really, to take these massive

523
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,330
data sets and actually produce a
workbook, a spreadsheet that

524
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,650
everybody knows how to access,
and really get this important

525
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,390
data in front of the teams
that are working on

526
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,640
the games every day.

527
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:24,590

528
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,890
Great.

529
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,240
So we're going to switch
gears a little bit now.

530
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,440
Again, that was a relatively
simple example of what you can

531
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,260
do to hook BigQuery up to

532
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,040
spreadsheets using Apps Script.

533
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,640
There's a lot of other things
you can do with Apps Script as

534
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,870
well, so definitely
have a look at it.

535
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,340
You can convert those
spreadsheets to PDFs, you can

536
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,390
email them to everybody.

537
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,610
There's loads and loads you
can do with them, so

538
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,150
definitely have a good
look at that.

539
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,750
So now we're going to talk a
little bit about how we build

540
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,570
tools that kind of industrialize
our learning.

541
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,540
So we do do a ton of
ad hoc analysis.

542
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,050
We've got four or five analysts
on our team that are

543
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,850
looking at our data
every single day.

544
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,460

545
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,760
All right, that's what
we've looked at.

546
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,970
But the next thing we're going
to look at is how we take

547
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,410
those learnings and how we build
tools that also interact

548
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,340
with our data to kind of
automate optimizations that we

549
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,050
see or automate tooling
that can help us.

550
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,100
And so the first one we're going
to talk about is a tool

551
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,830
that is called Mailman.

552
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,650
It's an engagement tool, and
it's built with App Engine.

553
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,180

554
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,550
So App Engine &mdash;

555
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,700
we get asked this
a lot as well.

556
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,550
Why do we use App Engine?

557
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,130
If anybody wants to go for a
beer later, I can talk to for

558
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,430
about two hours on all the
reasons why I love App Engine.

559
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,450
App Engine is fantastic, and
integrating it with other

560
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,680
Google services really
make it even better.

561
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,340
But just simply, if we had to
boil it down into a couple of

562
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,380
points, it's super productive,
right?

563
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,430
So I think I've said this
already today, but we just

564
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,690
like to focus on the problems
and leave some of the heavy

565
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,270
lifting to the Google
Cloud Platform.

566
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,700
And it's pretty powerful,
particularly for small teams

567
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,050
that are trying to grow
their businesses.

568
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,670
You need every minute of every
day on your products, not on

569
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,710
infrastructure.

570
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,150
The deployment model's
really cool.

571
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,630
All of our guys love the
deployment model.

572
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,450
We can't actually take advantage
of it as much as,

573
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,740
say, if you had a website that
you could, but we still make

574
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,370
very, very good use of it.

575
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,460
And then, of course, scale.

576
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,105
We mentioned this
once or twice.

577
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:30,840
We're going to mention
it again.

578
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,530
We cannot integrate with any
service that we don't believe

579
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,400
can scale along with us, because
we're always planning

580
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,970
for success.

581
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,200
We're expecting big numbers, big
traffic, big concurrency.

582
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,060
And if we're going to build
tools that run alongside our

583
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,430
games that our games platform's
going to be

584
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,720
speaking to at that sort of
level, we have to make the

585
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,350
right decisions.

586
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,470
And we feel very, very
good about our

587
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,670
choice of App Engine.

588
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,600
We've been working with it
for about two years now.

589
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,430
So Mailman, just to dig into &mdash;

590
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,700
this is just one of the
tools we've built.

591
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,370
We've built a number.

592
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,020
We decided to focus on
these two today.

593
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,600
So Mailman really is an
automated delivery mechanism

594
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,290
or delivery tool
for messaging.

595
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,500
It's really important
within our games.

596
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,850
People aren't playing
our games all

597
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,510
day, and that's healthy.

598
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,070
Some of them actually do, which
we're worried about, but

599
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,050
most of them don't, right?

600
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,130
Most of them are normal people,
and they come and go,

601
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,790
and they play a lot of
different games.

602
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,960
And so when we do our ad hoc
analysis, and we see the sorts

603
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,620
of drop-off points that maybe
are concerning to us, and we

604
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,620
see where people get stuck
within the game, sometimes

605
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,900
it's too late for us.

606
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,410
And because they got stuck in
the game at a certain point

607
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,580
that we've now identified,
they're not

608
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,320
planning on coming back.

609
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,350
And so this is when we have to
basically reach out to them.

610
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,790
And this is just one
case, right?

611
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,230
We reach out to our players all
the time through email,

612
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,020
through push notifications and
Facebook notifications.

613
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:58,200
So the logical components
of Mailman are lists.

614
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,890
Lists really answer the who.

615
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,550
So the powerful bit about
lists is that lists are

616
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,640
basically groups of message
recipients, so

617
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,870
they represent players.

618
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,440
And the list can be defined
with a query.

619
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,360
So anything we can write a query
for, anything that we

620
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,780
turn up in our ad hoc analysis,
we can just define a

621
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,420
new list with a query.

622
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,840
We use a little bit of
templating to make sure that

623
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,910
we can use those same queries
over and over daily, if they

624
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,330
need to be refreshed
daily, but it's a

625
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,370
pretty powerful thing.

626
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,730
And what actually happens
technically under the hood

627
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:36,280
when one of those lists are
created is that under the

628
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,760
hood, we basically make
a query to BigQuery.

629
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,890
And for those of you that are
familiar with App Engine, we

630
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,085
store the results, no matter how
large they are &mdash; we store

631
00:27:44,085 --> 00:27:46,800
those results in
the Blobstore.

632
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,400
And so jobs, when they
actually run &mdash;

633
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,700
the messaging jobs &mdash;

634
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,930
this is really where we take
advantage of App Engine's

635
00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:00,030
scale and parallelism, because
we make use of the MapReduce

636
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,700
API and the pipeline APIs, and
that means that essentially,

637
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,210
we can spin up a lot of
instances to go away and map

638
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,420
over the results that we got
back from our query.

639
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,100
And so jobs really represent &mdash;

640
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,230
if lists are the who, then jobs
really answer the what,

641
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,500
the when, and the where, because
what happens when this

642
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,940
MapReduce job runs across all
these instances that just sort

643
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,960
of fire up magically is that for
every single recipient and

644
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,570
message that we're going to
send, we enqueue a task.

645
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,840
And so sometimes we run huge,
huge volumes of messaging,

646
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,180
whether it's email, push
notifications, Facebook

647
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,370
notifications.

648
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,160
You could very easily run a job
one night that's going to

649
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,570
be to millions of users.

650
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,940
And App Engine can handle
that pretty seamlessly.

651
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,670
And one of the things you'll
find when you start working

652
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,670
with App Engine is that there's
so many great APIs and

653
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,600
services that are made available
to you when you

654
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,570
build on that platform.

655
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,310
And so one of the ways in which
we &mdash; there's a feature

656
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,760
called ETA, and ETA essentially
means that you can

657
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,460
specify the earliest time
that you want a

658
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,970
specific task to run.

659
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,460
And so we actually use the ETA
feature within the task use to

660
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,110
make sure that part of our query
on that list, one of the

661
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,870
columns of data that comes
back for every row

662
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,610
is actually a hint.

663
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,890
And it hints to us what time of
day we should actually send

664
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,570
out a message to make sure that
we get the highest chance

665
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,920
that a user's going to respond
to that and engage with that

666
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,400
message and come back
to the game.

667
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,290
And so we use a lot.

668
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,985
And obviously, we deliver across
the different channels.

669
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:27,590
So that's Mailman.

670
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,700
The next one we're going to talk
to you about &mdash; this is

671
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,960
the last one &mdash;

672
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,750
is called Cobra, and Cobra is
also built on App Engine.

673
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,220
So Cobra's really interesting
because as you can imagine,

674
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,900
once your game's mature &mdash;

675
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,000
you launch a game, it's out
there for three or six months.

676
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,590
You're doing loads
of optimizations.

677
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,760
You really start to push it.

678
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,960
It's getting bigger and
bigger and bigger.

679
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,520
And slowly, what you see
happening is that you can't

680
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,600
just address users that
are, say, right on

681
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,610
the bleeding edge.

682
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,990
And you can't really just
address users that are on day

683
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,310
one or day two or day three.

684
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,810
But there's lots of different
strategies that you want to

685
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,240
deploy to make sure that you
have the best chance at

686
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,230
monetizing users at all of
the different stages

687
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,610
of their life cycle.

688
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,100
And so that's what Cobra
does for us.

689
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,660
Cobra is basically a pricing and
promotions engine which is

690
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,910
aware of players' profiles.

691
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,770

692
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,370
Cobra is loosely integrated
with BigQuery, but is also

693
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,370
heavily integrated with
our games platform.

694
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,280
And the other thing that it does
is it acts as a middleman

695
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,830
through all the transactions.

696
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,800
No matter what the platform,
all of our transactions

697
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,240
securely flow through Mailman,
are authenticated and

698
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,350
validated, and then
they proceed.

699
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:42,000
So if we think about the pricing
and promotions engine,

700
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,380
what's actually happening today
is a very iterative

701
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,340
process where we go away and
we do a lot of ad hoc

702
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,530
analysis, and from that ad hoc
analysis, we come up with

703
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,130
strategies.

704
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,100
So different pricing and
promotion strategies that we

705
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,330
want to basically program into
Cobra, and then deploy.

706
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,620
And when someone actually does
interact with one of these

707
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,960
offers, or a promotion, or a
response to maybe a subtle

708
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,720
change in some of the pricing,
we record that.

709
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,570
So they make a purchase, it's
tagged with a bunch of

710
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,580
information about the
configuration that they

711
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,480
responded to, and that flows
down into our games platform,

712
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,660
which, again, nightly, comes
back up into BigQuery.

713
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,510
And so we do a lot of manual
iterative processes there.

714
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,980
And that works really,
really well.

715
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,590
But one of the next things that
we're looking at is how

716
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,370
we can use something called the
Prediction API, and this

717
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,760
is another from Google which
I'm told is really, really

718
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,820
heavily used internally, and not
used that much externally.

719
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,210
But we definitely have
a use case for it.

720
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,500
So just at a super high level,
because we're running out of

721
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:51,020
time, the Prediction API kind
of has two functions.

722
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,490
If you have a model &mdash;

723
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,660
so you've got a lot of raw data,
which obviously we do,

724
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,070
and many of you, I would
imagine, have as well &mdash;

725
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:03,040
and you think that if you did
some analysis on that data,

726
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,710
you might be able to come up
with some statistically

727
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,700
significant indicators
of an outcome.

728
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,340
So for us, within Cobra, that
might be, this user's profile

729
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,930
looks like this right now.

730
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,910
Which type of offer do I think
they're most likely to convert

731
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,250
with, or to convert on?

732
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,010
So basically, you just put
a bunch of data in cloud

733
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,380
storage, you point that at
the training endpoint.

734
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,260
Prediction will suck up all
the data, will train

735
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,140
the model for you.

736
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,700
And when it's complete, you can
actually query that model.

737
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,830
So you can query that
statistical model with,

738
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,140
essentially, what would be a
row of data &mdash; so a row of

739
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,120
these features.

740
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,980
And that would try and
predict what that

741
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,270
example value might be.

742
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,640
So Cobra with Prediction.

743
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,910
You can kind of see how
that would work.

744
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,480
And so the way in which we might
use it, or one of the

745
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,510
ways in which we might use it,
is to just help us train on

746
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,310
our financial data, train on our
profiles data, and try and

747
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,110
help us make even better
decisions about what kind of

748
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:11,670
offers to surface to players
based on where they are in

749
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,540
their lifetime.

750
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,720
And that's a pretty
powerful thing.

751
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,500
So that's something we're
experimenting with, and

752
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,880
hopefully, maybe next year, we
can come back in and talk

753
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,860
about how that went.

754
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,400
So just to sort of recap, my big
thing is, we've grown the

755
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,620
social team at Gamesys from
about 4 people sitting in a

756
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,550
little hallway to 100 people
that occupy most of a floor.

757
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,250
And I think one of the ways in
which we've done that is that

758
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,370
we try and stand on the
shoulders of giants, and not

759
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,670
try and replicate a
lot of work that

760
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,320
can be done by others.

761
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,520
And these are fantastic
products.

762
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,100
And if you invest the time into
understanding how they

763
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,340
work and what they can do for
you, you'll spend less time on

764
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,950
all the boring, painful stuff.

765
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,530
And you'll really be able to get
at your data, build really

766
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,270
cool tools, and focus
on your game,

767
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,860
which I think is paramount.

768
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,340
MATT MCNEILL: Great.

769
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,590
Thanks Tom.

770
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:12,560

771
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,460
I hope you got a sense of some
of the insight that data is

772
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,570
really bringing to gaming.

773
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,670
I can see that I'm going to lose
another six months of my

774
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,429
life when this game launches.

775
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,889
But I think there's some trends
that I'm seeing across

776
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,080
the industry, and one of the
things I'd say is, every

777
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,600
successful game company seems
to have three components.

778
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,560
The first is, obviously, the
technology, and that's often

779
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,409
the obvious one where
people start.

780
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,000
Hey, what technology, which
platforms do we choose?

781
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,810
But it's what you
do on top of it.

782
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,840
There's obviously the marketing
department and the

783
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,120
user acquisition side &mdash;

784
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,219
critically important.

785
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,909
But the thing I think that is
somewhat neglected, where

786
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:55,730
there's a real opportunity, is
in this area of analytics.

787
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,530
And one thing I'd say about
the Google platforms &mdash;

788
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,860
not just the Cloud Platform
that I'm involved in, but

789
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,090
actually all of Google's
services &mdash;

790
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,960
are helping game developers
and players

791
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,410
across a whole suite.

792
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,750
The Cloud Platform,
particularly, I think Tom

793
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,000
really brought out
what's important.

794
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,550
The platform is something,
really, which we built for us

795
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,820
here at Google.

796
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,065
This is our success.

797
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:24,870
And our strategy over the last
18 months is to externalize

798
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,560
that so that people
can use it.

799
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,390
So for me, personally, it's
really exciting to see the

800
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,800
work people like Tom, and
actually many of you in the

801
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,540
audience, are really starting to
do to build in a different

802
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,750
way and into the future, not
just of gaming, but technology

803
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,610
as a whole.

804
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,730
So I know we've had a
little bit of time.

805
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,680
I can see we've got about four
minutes on the clock for Q&A.

806
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,710
So we'll take some questions
now, but if you've got

807
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,860
anything else, we'll be at
the Cloud booth later on.

808
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,420
So any questions now?

809
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,490
We'll take a few.

810
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,536
Otherwise, we can
grab some beers.

811
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:03,010
Yeah, question here.

812
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,580
AUDIENCE: Did you start with
BigQuery, or did you have to

813
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,550
migrate over from
another RDBMS?

814
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,700
And if so, what challenges
did you see?

815
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:18,210
TOM NEWTON: For this sort of
work, to try and work with

816
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,710
data sets that are this big,
within some of the other

817
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,100
relational database services
that are out

818
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,650
there, we really struggled.

819
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,070
We really struggled.

820
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,790
And we also spent a lot
of time just trying

821
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,936
to make sure that &mdash;

822
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:35,600
we ran into so many different
problems along the way.

823
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,000
Particularly, when we started
some of these games, we never

824
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,510
thought we'd generate
this much data.

825
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,290
And at the time, we didn't
really have a good

826
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,070
understanding of the fact that
recording all this data at

827
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,840
this fine grain a level
was really necessary.

828
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,690
And so when we started looking
at BigQuery, we were using

829
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:57,140
MySQL databases, and that worked
relatively well to a

830
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,760
certain point.

831
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,930
But also, it required a fair
amount of maintenance and

832
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,720
human intervention and sysadmins
and experts with

833
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,470
that technology.

834
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,810
And we just want
to make games.

835
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,160
We don't want to have a bunch
of guys on the team that are

836
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,150
constantly focused on trying
to maintain these pieces of

837
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,320
software, not when there are
services like this that are

838
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,570
out there that you can leverage
that just make life

839
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,240
that much easier &mdash; and to be
fair, are way more powerful,

840
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,960
and come with fantastic APIs.

841
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,800

842
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,080
So I hope that answers
your question.

843
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,410
We can talk to you a little bit
more about it afterwards.

844
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,500
AUDIENCE: I have one
more for you, too,

845
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,640
if I can get a chance.

846
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,470
TOM NEWTON: Sure.

847
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,300
MATT MCNEILL: Yes.

848
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,100
AUDIENCE: Yes.

849
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,600
So you have these ETL processes
that you're running

850
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,550
at the end of the day
or something, right?

851
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,890
And then basically, you're using
all this infrastructure

852
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,710
as a sort of [? all up ?] queue,
and you have all the

853
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,200
services that you
run out of it.

854
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,850
So I'm curious as to what were
the technical reasons for the

855
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:58,050
new games that you're making
that you didn't choose just to

856
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,180
build the whole thing on the
Google Cloud Platform and

857
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,080
avoid having your own
servers right now?

858
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,530
So were there lower latency
things, or some technological

859
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,190
things that were missing?

860
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,180
Because then it would avoid
having to do the ETL extract

861
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,740
at the end, and then run your
own App Engine processes, and

862
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,250
then extract that again out,
and putting it back in.

863
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:22,770
TOM NEWTON: So, sorry.

864
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,950
The question is, why don't we
build the games themselves on

865
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,480
App Engine or on Google
Cloud Platform?

866
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,320
AUDIENCE: What are the technical
features that are

867
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,300
missing from there?

868
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,630
TOM NEWTON: Well, for App
Engine, for games that require

869
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,610
bidirectional socket
communication, you're not

870
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,920
going to be able to do
that on App Engine.

871
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,910
It's scaled at the moment
not particularly well.

872
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,390
But now with Compute Engine
coming along, there's

873
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,650
absolutely no reason why you
can't build an entire game

874
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,770
stack on the Google
Cloud Platform.

875
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,130
I think the thing to remember
is that we started building

876
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,330
social games about 4 and 1/2
years ago, and built up a

877
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,140
platform on another provider.

878
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,880
And we've got a lot
of code there.

879
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,560
We can leverage that.

880
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,500
We can build games
really, really

881
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,380
quickly on that platform.

882
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,110
But to be honest, I'm
dying to find a game

883
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,030
that sort of fits &mdash;

884
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,630
maybe one of our next ones &mdash;
that we can actually build

885
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,680
with App Engine, if
it makes sense.

886
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,522
If it doesn't require
bidirectional sockets.

887
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:13,772
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

888
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:16,050

889
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,410
AUDIENCE: So two questions.

890
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,940
What are you guys using
to visualize the data?

891
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,740
Is it all just spreadsheets
with queries

892
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,660
and put into a chart?

893
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,070
Are you using any other
tools to visualize it?

894
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,400
TOM NEWTON: We kind of let
people pick and choose what

895
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,240
tools they want to use.

896
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,660
So we have been fairly heavy
users of Tableau in the past.

897
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,760
Some of our analysts just like
to work within Microsoft Excel

898
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,540
sometimes, and they use the
connector for Excel, and they

899
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,160
do a lot of visualizations
in there.

900
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,830
But for the most part, to be
honest, our core dashboards

901
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:54,060
and some of our most, I'd say,
insightful information sits

902
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,630
within these dashboards that
we put together for each

903
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,555
product now.

904
00:39:57,555 --> 00:39:59,600
And a lot of them are ad hoc
analysis that are actually

905
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,930
done by the analysts, so they
can choose how they want to

906
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:06,370
visualize it and then circulate
it to the teams.

907
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:06,550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

908
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,470
I was actually wondering if
you can speak a little bit

909
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:14,220
about the predictive models that
you were showing there.

910
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,480
It wasn't clear, at least to me,
if that was something that

911
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,940
was done within the App Engine,
or is that something

912
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,550
that you're doing external?

913
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,160
And what kind of tools are
you using for that?

914
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,390
TOM NEWTON: Sure.

915
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,300
So I kind of rushed through
that, I apologize.

916
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,460
The Prediction API is
actually another

917
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,870
API provided by Google.

918
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,940
And we can talk a little bit &mdash;
oh, we have to get offstage.

919
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,360
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

920
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,255
TOM NEWTON: I'll come and have
a chat with you about that.

921
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:38,840
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah.

922
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,400
Sounds good.

923
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,320
MATT MCNEILL: OK, are we
OK to have a chat at

924
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,210
the booth maybe later?

925
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,340
I'm just thinking that we're
probably timed out here.

926
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,590
But thanks, Tom.

927
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,850
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

928
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,270

please come by the booth.
