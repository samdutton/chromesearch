00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,290
MALE SPEAKER 1: Shanghai GDG
is a very interesting

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,160
developer community.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,000
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,080
has asked this question.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,490
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is where
the magic happens.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,300
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: This is
primarily a question and

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,520
answer show.

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,770
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions &mdash;

10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,730

11
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,490
PETER LUBBERS: Hello, and
welcome to the Chrome

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,010
Developer Channel on Google
Developer Live.

13
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,360
Really excited to
be here today.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,680
In the studio, we
have Jan Linden.

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,960
And on air from Seattle,
we have Chris Wilson.

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,930
I'm Peter Lubbers, the program
manager in the Chrome

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,100
Developer Relations team.

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,910
Jan, can you tell us a little
bit about what you do at

19
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,610
Google before we get started?

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,200
JAN LINDEN: Absolutely.

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,170
So I'm on the Chrome team.

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,790
I am a product manager that
focuses on everything audio in

23
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,540
Chrome, which is really
exciting.

24
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,710
Because there's happening a
lot in this area, and in

25
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,270
particular, the Web Audio API
that we're talked about today

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,300
is really bringing the web to
a new level that we haven't

27
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,230
seen before.

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,160
PETER LUBBERS: Thanks.

29
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,780
And coming to us from Seattle,
Chris Wilson.

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,420
Chris, can you tell us a little
bit about what you do

31
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,280
at Google, and how you got
involved with web audio?

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,050
CHRIS WILSON: Sure, Peter.

33
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,260
So I'm on the Chrome Developer
Relations team.

34
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,760
In short, that means I get to
play with all the neat stuff

35
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,110
that Jan and his team put
together and build some neat

36
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,020
demos, come up with different
ways of using it, push

37
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,330
feedback back to him.

38
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,680
And more than anything, work
with other developers on what

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,550
they want to build and what they
want to get out of the

40
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,090
API and other APIs as
well, of course.

41
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,340
So that's kind of what I
do on a daily basis.

42
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,070
As for how I got into web
audio, it was really &mdash;

43
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,100
I got really interested when I
started seeing the ability to

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,680
build software synthesizers
and processing units and

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,725
things like that.

46
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,260
It had been something I'd
started getting very

47
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,910
interested in.

48
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,430
Just because in the last decade
or so, all of this neat

49
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,730
hardware that I grew up with
really as a keyboard player,

50
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,660
suddenly you could actually
replicate it all in software

51
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,139
relatively easily.

52
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,440
And the Web Audio API letting
you do that in an even easier

53
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,930
software way was really
exciting to me.

54
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,410
PETER LUBBERS: Excellent.

55
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:18,750
Excellent.

56
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,830
Well, and full disclosure, I
don't know all that much about

57
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,920
Web Audio myself, but I got to
carry Chris's speakers at

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,320
Google I/O. And my youngest
son is an aspiring DJ.

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,570
CHRIS WILSON: Everybody
needs roadies.

60
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,370

61
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,230
PETER LUBBERS: Excellent.

62
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:36,560
All right.

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,550
So a quick agenda &mdash;

64
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,770
so we're going to talk &mdash;

65
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,100
and I mentioned this is the
first of a two-part series.

66
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,880
In the first one, we'll talk
about mostly an introductory

67
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,630
session about what Web Audio is,
how you can use it in your

68
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,120
applications.

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,900
And in the second one, which
will be in a few weeks &mdash; we'll

70
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,930
announce it on our
Google+ page &mdash;

71
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,870
we'll talk more about how you
can use Web Audio in games.

72
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,970
Chris is going to show a demo.

73
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,750
That demo will be available on
GitHub, so for sure check it

74
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,430
out after the event.

75
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,200
So without further ado, Chris,
do you want to start off

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,680
talking about Web Audio?

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
CHRIS WILSON: Sure.

78
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,190
So I gave a talk at Google
I/O on the Web Audio API.

79
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,800
And I wanted to run through just
a couple of the slides

80
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,110
from that because it sort of
helps capture, for me, what

81
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,970
the Web Audio API is.

82
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,610
I want to show off probably two
of the demos that I built

83
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:43,180
for Google I/O. And then we'll
open it up to the floor from

84
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,250
there, I think.

85
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,360
But I do recommend, if you want
more detail about how Web

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,610
Audio is put together, go watch
the YouTube video of the

87
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,910
talk that I gave or run
through the slides.

88
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,430
They're all publicly
available.

89
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,810
And like you said, all the demos
that I have are actually

90
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,720
up on GitHub and posted today.

91
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,060
PETER LUBBERS: Right.

92
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,860
Actually, just before you dive
into it, Chris, the moderator

93
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,580
link is linked on the Google
Developers Live page for this

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,330
event, for those of you
that haven't seen it.

95
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,400
Scroll down to the bottom
of the page.

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,380
Currently, we have six questions
with 65 votes, so

97
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,670
we'll take those afterwards.

98
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,945
But you can still ask additional
questions.

99
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:22,530
All right.

100
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,250
Over to you.

101
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:30,550
CHRIS WILSON: OK, so let me flip
to my slide deck here.

102
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,950
So the first question that
always comes up when I try to

103
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,380
describe the Web Audio API to
people is, why do we even need

104
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,940
another audio API?

105
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,420
We now have this great audio
element that we've had for a

106
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,260
few years now, but even that
took a long time for us to get

107
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,490
implemented across
all the browsers.

108
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,370
Because prior to that, we had
proprietary bgsound stuff that

109
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,290
wasn't really controllable
and wasn't a great

110
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,210
way of doing audio.

111
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,130
And the audio element
is great.

112
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,590
I don't want anyone walking away
thinking that we want to

113
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,630
move people away from
the audio tag.

114
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,310
Because it actually is a really
easy way to wrap up

115
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,520
these steps of loading,
decoding, and playing audio

116
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,350
all into one.

117
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,100
And you get a set of controls
right there.

118
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,640
The user can click the Play
button, and it plays.

119
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,620
It shows you where you are
in the sound file.

120
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,520
You've got volume controls and
all that kind of stuff.

121
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,190
And of course, you can hook
in and control those

122
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,990
yourself, if you want.

123
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,510
But the problem that we have
with that is that you don't

124
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,910
really have this fine-grained
control ability.

125
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,320
Like, you can scrub in the
audio and play from a

126
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,210
particular place in
the audio file.

127
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,360
But you don't have the
ability to do this

128
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,760
very precise timing.

129
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,990
Because it packages up this
loading, decoding, and playing

130
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,230
step altogether.

131
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,780
So when you hit the button to
play a sound, it doesn't

132
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,770
necessarily play it right at
that millisecond, or sub

133
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,470
millisecond, even more
interestingly.

134
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,140
So Web Audio lets you do this
very precise timing.

135
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,470
You can have lots of overlapping
sounds as well.

136
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,620
[VIDEO GAME SHOOTING
NOISE WITH REVERB]

137
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,380
CHRIS WILSON: And it's really
easy to set that

138
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,050
up inside the API.

139
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,560
But secondly, even more
interestingly, the Web Audio

140
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,930
API provides an audio pipeline,
a routing system,

141
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,660
and a bunch of effects and
filters, so that you can very

142
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,990
easily do different things
with your audio.

143
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,890
You can filter it.

144
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,340
You can add reverb effects.

145
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,720
You can add all kinds of
echo or delay effects.

146
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,960
[SHOOTING NOISE WITH ECHO]

147
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,540
CHRIS WILSON: And it's pretty
easy to set those up.

148
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,760
Inside this deck, by the way,
all of these things are live

149
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,650
HTML demos.

150
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,660
So it's pretty easy to dig in
and look at what they say.

151
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,080
Later in the deck &mdash; which I'm
not going to go into &mdash;

152
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,390
there's a ton of code in there,
so you can see how I'm

153
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,450
setting up these effects.

154
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,930
And then finally, the Web Audio
API has a bunch of hooks

155
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,040
to visualize audio data and
manipulate it on the fly.

156
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,340
So it's not just a static, hey,
you have an MP3 file.

157
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,810
Hit Play and it'll
come out through

158
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,080
somebody's speaker somewhere.

159
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,330
You can actually do things like
analyze it on a frequency

160
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,390
basis and get kind of the
standard graphic equalizer

161
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,160
view of the audio.

162
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,375
Now, on top of that,
there were really &mdash;

163
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,210
oops, sorry.

164
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,610
There we go.

165
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,670
The API itself is actually
defined at

166
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,950
a pretty high level.

167
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,920
So it's really easy to do
basic things like &mdash;

168
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,940
COMPUTER: Play sound now.

169
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,400
CHRIS WILSON: --playing
a single sound.

170
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,900
That's the code for
it right there.

171
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,420
I just create a buffer source.

172
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,920
I set it to the right buffer,
connect it to the speakers,

173
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,570
and start playing it.

174
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,030
And even doing effects
and filters &mdash;

175
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,130
what I have in this code is
essentially exactly the code

176
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,750
from that last slide
when I hit Fire.

177
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,670
And it had an echo effect.

178
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,330
You don't need to understand
low-level audio digital signal

179
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,660
processing in order to
use these things.

180
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,520
In fact, I'm not an
audio engineer.

181
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,870
And if I had to go build a whole
bunch of matrices and

182
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,530
build my own or even directly
use an FFT transform to get

183
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,020
these audio effects to work,
I'm pretty sure I would go

184
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,250
find something else
to play with.

185
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,840
Because that just seems like
a lot of hard work.

186
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,490
But at the same time, of course,
if you want to do

187
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,360
that, there is a way to do
very low-level API custom

188
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,470
audio processing directly
in JavaScript.

189
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,080
You can sit there and
manipulate the bits

190
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,570
individually if you want to.

191
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,480

192
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,705
Now &mdash;

193
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:37,130
come on &mdash;

194
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,520
one of our big goals &mdash;

195
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:45,510
and this never works well in
screen sharing, so I'd

196
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,770
encourage you to go look at
this in the slide deck

197
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,390
yourself on your own machine.

198
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,990
But the biggest thing that we
were really trying to do was

199
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,780
make audio and audio processing
independent of all

200
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,210
the other stuff that's
going on.

201
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,560
We push all of our native audio
processing off into a

202
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,750
separate high-priority thread,
which means doing even complex

203
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,560
audio shouldn't cause glitches
in the visuals.

204
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,660
Like I said, I'm not going to
run through this demo here,

205
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,790
just because in screen sharing,
it doesn't work

206
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,160
particularly well.

207
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,170
But I wanted to give a really
high-level view of some of the

208
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,520
features that we needed to
supply for gaming purposes and

209
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,540
some of the features we
needed to supply for

210
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,180
more musical purposes.

211
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,960
And then I'll show a quick demo
or two that I've built.

212
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,380
So I already mentioned you need
very precise timing for

213
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,980
many simultaneous sounds.

214
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,920
Games typically have tons and
tons of effects going on at

215
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,520
the same time.

216
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,950
And the HTML audio element
doesn't really scale to having

217
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,670
lots of sounds.

218
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,870
Half a dozen is OK.

219
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,430
But 25 or so &mdash; it starts
getting kind of wonky.

220
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,490
And of course, you need
very precise timing.

221
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,130
When you hit Fire, you want
to hear the fire almost

222
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,680
immediately.

223
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,660
But we also need features like
3D spatialization, placing

224
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,250
sounds in a sound field.

225
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,010
Doppler shift &mdash;

226
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,990
If you drive past a police
officer in a driving game, you

227
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,050
want to hear the siren
change pitch.

228
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,660
And doing things like automatic
distance attenuation

229
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,740
and sound directionality, so you
can hear where a sound is

230
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,920
in a virtual environment.

231
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,260
And it sounds very realistic.

232
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,200
You also need lots of
filtering effects to

233
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,710
automatically make audio sound
like it's being blocked by a

234
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,380
wall, or like it's coming over
a radio or a telephone.

235
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,962
This is the same sound file
that I played before.

236
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:44,270
COMPUTER: Play sound now.

237
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,990
CHRIS WILSON: --but it sounds
like it's coming over a

238
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,980
telephone, even if you have a
really high-quality audio

239
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,060
connection, which we don't
right now, but.

240
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,640
And then finally, of course,
you need acoustic

241
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,400
environments.

242
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,990
If you walk into a large room
and fire your BFG9000, it

243
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,230
should sound different than if
you're in a tiny little closet

244
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,480
and you fire it.

245
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,180

246
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,500
And of course, for both gaming
and music, we need the ability

247
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,580
to create kind of scheduled
sound events.

248
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,660
We need to create sequences or
loops or things like that.

249
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,470
But we also need to automate
things like

250
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,720
fade-ins and fade-outs.

251
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,420

252
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,800
Now, for music, there are a
few kind of basic sound

253
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,370
elements that you need for
musical applications.

254
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,790
You may or may not use them
in gaming applications.

255
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,450
Sometimes games record all
their music or effects.

256
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,730
And they're all sound buffers.

257
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,810
Sometimes they actually do
want to create the sound

258
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,790
effects using oscillators.

259
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,180
So oscillators let you create
sine waves and sawtooth waves

260
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,210
and things like that, and set
frequency and change the

261
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,220
frequency and that
sort of thing.

262
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,070
Music also uses a lot of
dynamics processing.

263
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,040
So this is usually referred to
as compression and expansion.

264
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,650
If you look at &mdash; this is
actually a picture of one of

265
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,150
the racks in my music
studio at home.

266
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,160
And one of the units in this
is actually a hardware

267
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,450
compressor.

268
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,040
So a piece of hardware that
actually does this one

269
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,390
particular processing.

270
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,480
We also need to do things
like distortion effects.

271
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,470
One of the other units there
is a guitar amp processor.

272
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,230
And a lot of that is actually
just applying very carefully

273
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,440
designed distortion
to a sound.

274
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,380
And then as we mentioned before,
you need a lot of

275
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,255
frequency and waveform analysis
kind of features.

276
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:32,900

277
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,410
So the first demo that I wanted
to show is actually &mdash;

278
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,410
this is the Web Audio playground
is what I ended up

279
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,380
calling this.

280
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,850
And this basically is just
a way for you to visually

281
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,170
explore what you can do with
the Web Audio API.

282
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,640
So I can do things like add an
audio buffer source, connect

283
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,764
it to the speakers,
and hit Play.

embedded features there.

292
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,670
I can create something.

293
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,510
I can do a &mdash; oh, let's show
one of our neat frequency

a filter node in there.

another frequency analyzer so

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,010
we can see what it looks like.

of a smaller screen than I

musical effects, as well as

So I created a vocoder.

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,150
This is actually one of the
first things that I set out to

this using Web Audio.

It's basically the robot
voice effect.

329
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,510
And what vocoding does is it
takes one sound file or one

330
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,990
sound input, usually referred to
as the modulator, which is

CHRIS WILSON: Now, the really
cool thing about this, to me,

353
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,040
is this is all happening
in real time.

354
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,400

of nodes and plugged

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,310
them all together.

my JavaScript code is doing

[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

371
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,910
CHRIS WILSON: So there's a lot
of dynamics to this whole

372
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,990
thing, like everything is
happening in real time.

373
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,610
And I've done a bunch of
tweaking work behind the

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,410
scenes to set this process up.

375
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,440
But once the process is going,
all I have to do is go in and

376
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,450
change parameters on the Web

378
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,880
So this was the first demo
that I was building.

379
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,800
And it was kind of one of these
journeys, because I

380
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,829
spent a ton of time just digging
through and starting

381
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,599
to understand more and more
what a vocoder does.

382
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,030
I was very, very naive when
I started building this.

383
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,720
And I think Chris Rogers, the
engineer on the project &mdash;

384
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,290
I think he didn't want
to tell me that I was

385
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,360
in way over my head.

386
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,350
But he helped me kind of dig my
way out, and managed to get

387
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,100
my head above water
eventually.

388
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,110
So this was kind
of a cool demo.

389
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,730

that I'm really looking

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,750
forward to building and
adding to this demo

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,730
as well in the future.

392
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,500
So I'm kind of excited to see
what other demos can get built

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,080
from that space.

394
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,880

earlier, by the way, the code

00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,650

at some of the questions.

403
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,700
Just a quick question.

404
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,760
What were some of the main
issues you ran into?

405
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,470
Or are there any specific tips
that you would want to share

406
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,250
after building that
great demo?

407
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,510
What are some of the highlights
of that, or some of

408
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,250
the things you should
say, well, really,

409
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,180
watch out for this?

410
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,330
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah.

411
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,940
The number one thing that I
would encourage people to do,

412
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,650
if you're going to do more
than just very basic &mdash;

413
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,750
I want to play very precisely
timed sounds.

414
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,100
The number one thing I would say
is, figure out very early

415
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,660
on, like, package up
a visual analyzer.

416
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,600
Figure out how to use the
real-time analyzer node and be

417
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,570
able to use that as kind of an
oscilloscope to see what's

418
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,650
going on in your code.

419
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,300
It helps so dramatically to be
able to see what the frequency

420
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
analysis is over time.

421
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:19,310
And during the course of me
having this Web Audio vocoder

422
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,680
code that I was in the process
of building, I would have four

423
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,780
or five frequency analyzers on
the screen so I could see what

424
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,410
was happening between
each step.

425
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,890
And I could tell, oh, wait, this
isn't actually affecting

426
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,460
the sound in the way
that I want it to.

427
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,490
Or my frequency bands aren't
really very well defined.

428
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,550
I need to up the order of the
filters that I'm using, or

429
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,240
something like that.

430
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,100
And it was fantastically helpful
for that purpose.

431
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,340
I think other than that, there
weren't any huge gotchas that

432
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,950
I ran into early on.

433
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,010
Mostly it turns out that
a vocoder is a

434
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,800
very finicky beast.

435
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,220
And you have to sit there and
tweak all of the volume levels

436
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,500
and the gain levels throughout
the whole thing.

437
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,490
And you have to very carefully
filter things at the

438
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,160
appropriate times to make it
sound good, because it turns

439
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,950
out it's not just a well-defined
process.

440
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,480
It's actually kind of a
very musical effect.

441
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,550
And you have to tune it
musically in order to make it

442
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,650
sound good in that context.

443
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,205
PETER LUBBERS: Cool.

444
00:20:24,205 --> 00:20:25,960
Yeah, I really liked what
you did with the

445
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,480
visualizations of it.

446
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,280
Did you use Canvas
for that or &mdash;

447
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,670
CHRIS WILSON: So that one,
actually, I shamelessly stole

448
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,570
straight from Chris Rogers.

449
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,280
He had built a visualizer,
I think fairly

450
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,980
early on in Web Audio.

451
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,290
And it uses WebGL to draw
the whole 3D mapping and

452
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,310
everything.

453
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,800
And the great thing about that
one, though, is it actually

454
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,840
tracks it over time,
so you can see.

455
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,240
The vocoder bars in the middle,
those are just a

456
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,460
capture of what's going on in
my code or in the vocoder

457
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,720
code, like tracking what the
frequency envelopes look like.

458
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,740
But when I originally
built it, I built my

459
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,980
own frequency analyzer.

460
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,750
Because I wanted to see where
exactly are my frequency bands

461
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,000
in relation to the frequency
analysis.

462
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,630
I set up a frequency analyzer
that looked very much like the

463
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,110
frequency analyzer that I played
with the drum sound

464
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,720
during the slide deck.

465
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,730
It looked like that, but
it drew vertical

466
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,240
bars, so I could see &mdash;

467
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,900
this is the center
of each of the

468
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,805
frequency bands in my vocoder.

469
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:40,600
And I could tell, wait a second,
this isn't lining up

470
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,270
to the right place, or
things like that.

471
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,120
It was super helpful.

472
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,620
JAN LINDEN: Yeah.

473
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,800
This was real exciting to see.

474
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,090
Chris, I don't want to downplay
your abilities, but

475
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,210
you're not exactly a signal
processing guy that knows

476
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,420
exactly about all
these things.

477
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,940
CHRIS WILSON: I am absolutely
not a signal processing guy.

478
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,640
JAN LINDEN: And the fact
that you could build

479
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,700
this is pretty amazing.

480
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,870
So it shows the capabilities of
this, and how much of the

481
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,860
hard stuff has been done
under the hood.

482
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,230
And using, as you said, the
tools of the frequency

483
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,670
analyzer to understand step by
step what you're doing makes

484
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,940
it possible to then fiddle
around and figure it out

485
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,920
without having to get into all
the details, and still come up

486
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,790
with this excellent result.

487
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,600
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah.

488
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,370
I think in retrospect, the hard
part, and the parts where

489
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,360
I spent the bulk of my time
building that demo, were not

490
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,110
building the Web Audio graph
to handle the sound

491
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,600
processing.

492
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,510
The biggest thing that I spent a
lot of time in was tweaking.

493
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,770
And there's actually &mdash;

494
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,440
if you go into the developer
tools while it's running, you

495
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,380
can actually find there's
a div with a

496
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,990
huge number of sliders.

497
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,030
I think it has about 20 sliders
still in it that were

498
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,520
just letting me tweak gain
levels throughout the process

499
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,530
of this thing.

500
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:04,650
And if you do things like give
it a different sound file that

501
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,770
isn't the same average volume
level, you may have to

502
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,130
re-tweak some of those things.

503
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,290
Because I didn't make
automatic volume

504
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,170
detection in it.

505
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,920
But really, it was that and
building a good-looking user

506
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,720
experience that took the
bulk of the time.

507
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,970
PETER LUBBERS: That's
excellent.

508
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,270
You definitely succeeded
in that.

509
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,800
Great.

510
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,470
So let's take a couple
questions.

511
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,100
So the first question on the
moderator is, will the API be

512
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,880
cross-browser compatible out of
the box, or will we have to

513
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,340
deal with vendor prefixes?

514
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,100
JAN LINDEN: Well, we will.

515
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,830
CHRIS WILSON: Always
a fun question.

516
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:46,180
So out of the box is an
interesting point, because Web

517
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,730
Audio has actually been in
Chrome for quite a while now.

518
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,990
It's been shipping and
[? stable ?] for &mdash;

519
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,030
before I was on the team.

520
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,490
JAN LINDEN: Yeah,
Chrome 13 or 14.

521
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,990
I can't remember, but
one of those.

522
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,360
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah.

523
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,190
Sounds about right.

524
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,750
And it is WebKit prefixed.

525
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,250
It is vendor prefixed today.

526
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:10,120
Although it is vendor prefixed
at the point where you say, I

527
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,580
want an audio context.

528
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,570
Like, I want to use
the Web Audio API.

529
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,770
Give me a handle to it.

530
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,310
And from then on, you don't
have WebKit prefixes

531
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,840
everywhere.

532
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,720
So hopefully, we'll end up with
an API that is very easy

533
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,660
to say, well, if you don't have
audio context, get WebKit

534
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,500
audio context.

535
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,890
And then most of it just
works after that.

536
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,380
As far as other browsers
adopting it, we've spent a lot

537
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,200
of time, and I think we've seen
a lot of movement in the

538
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,770
last five to six months,
probably, from other vendors

539
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,450
being very interested and
actively participating in the

540
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,820
API on the working group.

541
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,330
The Mozilla guys have been
involved in the Web Audio

542
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,150
working group, I think
since the beginning,

543
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,090
certainly for a long time.

544
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,170
Opera has jumped in, and given
a lot of feedback on the API,

545
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,060
which has been great.

546
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,120
Microsoft team has been
looking at Web Audio.

547
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,950
I feel like we're really pushing
very hard to move this

548
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,020
to something that is
cross-vendor and

549
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,610
cross-platform as well.

550
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:20,820
And right now, actually, in
Safari 6 in beta, and in iOS 6

551
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,620
Safari, we have support for
Web Audio, as well.

552
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,350
Granted, it's still
built on WebKit.

553
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,290
It's still WebKit
vendor prefixed.

554
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,780
But we do have it on a different
platform and

555
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,470
delivered from a different
vendor.

556
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,910
PETER LUBBERS: Great.

557
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,110
That question, by the
way, was from Ling.

558
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,810
Another question that was voted
up quite a bit was a

559
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,870
little bit about security.

560
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:47,120
So the question was from tr67.

561
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
What security measures need
to be taken in the

562
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,700
future for Web Audio?

563
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,660
Are audio popups a threat?

564
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,950
And how would subsequent
blocking techniques affect us

565
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,380
as developers?

566
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,010
Sure, anyone can hit a Mute
button, but what if a browser

567
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,470
is locked down completely?

568
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,110
So, Jan, do you want to
take a stab at that?

569
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,560
JAN LINDEN: Yeah.

570
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,910
It's a very interesting
question.

571
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,480
And actually, I'll start with
something that is not part of

572
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,960
Web Audio API right now,
but something we are

573
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,570
working hard on adding.

574
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,450
And that's input audio, as
well, through another API

575
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,710
called Get User Media,
which is right now

576
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,640
available in Chrome.

577
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,590
But they haven't been
hooked up yet.

578
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,950
But that means that you can
take input audio and then

579
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,010
process it, do an analysis, et
cetera, and directly either

580
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,510
play it out or just do whatever
you want with it.

581
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,150
And there, you definitely have
some interesting aspects of

582
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,120
privacy and security,
which have been

583
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,940
discussed and resolved.

584
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,500
So we've been able
to ship that.

585
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,470
But of course, then you have
to allow the microphone to

586
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,590
record what you're doing.

587
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,950
So there is a whole process
similar to getting location

588
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,490
data, et cetera,
in other APIs.

589
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,500
So that part has been
taken care of.

590
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,300
It will, of course, always be
a little bit clumsy in the

591
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,420
sense that the first time you go
to a domain, you will have

592
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,040
to allow it.

593
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,160
But then you can have always
allow for that one, if it's a

594
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,710
secure HTTP.

595
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,830
So that side is something that
I think people would be very

596
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:33,510
worried about, but it
is taken care of.

597
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,530
On the popups &mdash;

598
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,490
maybe, Chris, you've thought
more about that?

599
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,685
That's obviously &mdash;

600
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:39,060
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah.

601
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,740
I mean, I think for
output, it's a

602
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,754
really interesting question.

603
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:50,040
And I'm probably an interesting
person to

604
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,640
have it asked of.

605
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,110
Because despite being super
excited by the Web Audio API,

606
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,560
I'm the guy who &mdash;

607
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,850
my laptop is always muted.

608
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,640
I don't want to be in the middle
of a meeting and have

609
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,460
it start playing music or
something like that.

610
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,750
But also, I just don't
particularly like going to

611
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,660
websites and having
them play funky

612
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,850
background music or whatever.

613
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:19,590
So it's kind of a weird space
to be saying, hey, let's go

614
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,840
build this audio stuff into
the web platform.

615
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,890
I think that it is a
general concern.

616
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,190
I don't think it's really a
denial of service, because you

617
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,320
can always just hit the Mute
button on your machine.

618
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,870
I don't think the browser would
be completely locked

619
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,780
down in a situation where you
wouldn't want the user to have

620
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,490
access to the Mute button, like
a library system or a

621
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,600
kiosk system or something
like that.

622
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,975
Those are always going
to be options

623
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:52,470
unless it's simply disabled.

624
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,650
So I think that it is an
interesting question to handle

625
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,490
in the broader sense of what do
we do with audio elements

626
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,680
and bgsound and stuff
like that.

627
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,370
But I don't think it's
relevant just to

628
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,920
Web Audio by itself.

629
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,300
PETER LUBBERS: Cool.

630
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,340
Yeah.

631
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,340
That's definitely
a good question.

632
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,400
So another question was from &mdash;

633
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,210
let's see &mdash;

634
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,460
maxw3st.

635
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,780

636
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,040
What audio file formats
does the API handle?

637
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,310
JAN LINDEN: Yeah.

638
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:33,420
So in Chrome, we support AAC,
MP3, WAV files, and OGG.

639
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,040
And then for other platforms,
that depends

640
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,820
on what they support.

641
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,200
But basically, what you will do
is you support the same as

642
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,473
you do for the audio element.

643
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:46,350

644
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,920
And that could obviously be
added more in the future.

645
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,050
But these are, right now, the
ones that are the popular ones

646
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,020
and the ones that we
want to support.

647
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,430
But we are continuously looking
at if there are new

648
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,440
ones we can add at a later
time, if there is enough

649
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,260
reason for doing so.

650
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,270
PETER LUBBERS: Another
question is

651
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,460
from Tony-b from France.

652
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,700
Multichannel support &mdash;

653
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,640
how many, and what precision and
regularity for looping a

654
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,060
small sound a few milliseconds
long is available?

655
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,600

656
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,550
I think you dealt with
that extensively.

657
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:24,900
CHRIS WILSON: Right.

658
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,390
So multichannel support
is definitely &mdash;

659
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,790
there's two versions
of multichannel.

660
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,220
There's the can I get access
to stereo, or 5.1 surround

661
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,830
sound, or things like that.

662
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,620
Support for that is actually
built into the Web Audio API.

663
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,870
One of the demos I did for IO
was a left-right stereo

664
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:49,070
ping-pong delay, showing that
you could actually hook in and

665
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,170
control that.

666
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:56,320
There's also sort of the
multi-context support, like

667
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,700
the idea that I want to have two
separate audio outputs on

668
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,690
my computer, and be able to
control independently what

669
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,220
goes to each one of them.

670
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,160
A classic example of this for me
is one of the side projects

671
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,450
that I'm working on
is building tools

672
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,800
for doing disc jockeying.

673
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,220
And DJs typically have one audio
output that's going to

674
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,090
the main speakers.

675
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,660
And then they have
their headphones.

676
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,720
So you need to have two very
separate audio outputs,

677
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,970
because they send different
things to

678
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,000
those different speakers.

679
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,630
Like, they have a button on
their deck that says, play

680
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,130
this to my headphones, so they
can queue something up but not

681
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,380
let everyone hear it.

682
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,140
And I think that we need to have
that kind of capability.

683
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,100
It is a concept that has been
considered, I think, from the

684
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,350
very beginning of the API, but
we don't currently have

685
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,670
support for it yet.

686
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:58,150
As for the other side of that
question, what precision and

687
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,140
regularity for looping small
sounds, you absolutely can do

688
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,650
this essentially down
to the sample level.

689
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:11,430
All of our durations
are in seconds.

690
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,560
And they're floating
point numbers.

691
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,450
So you can go in and say, I
want to loop this from the

692
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,710
first sample to the last sample,
and it can only be &mdash;

693
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,730
you can say, this is only
100 samples long.

694
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,620
So 1/100 of whatever
the number of

695
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,460
samples per second is.

696
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,160
And I've actually done that.

697
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,770
I used an extremely short sound
buffer to replicate &mdash;

698
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,090
I think it was a sine wave,
before we got the oscillator

699
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,470
up and running inside
the code.

700
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,630
So it's very precise.

701
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,965
And the precision for duration
is just as precise.

702
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,200
PETER LUBBERS: Awesome.

703
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,380
All right.

704
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,970
One question I had as well,
and it was asked on the

705
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,860
moderator &mdash;

706
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,220
what are the options for
recording, archiving, and

707
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,400
playing back audio
conversations?

708
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,580
In fact, I was thinking
it would be great &mdash;

709
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,470
I don't know if it's even
added to your demo.

710
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,290
Once you've looped all these
things together, and you've

711
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,110
created that sound that you
liked, is it even possible in

712
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,800
your demo &mdash;

713
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,340
the first demo you showed &mdash;

714
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,250
to download or to save it?

715
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,990
CHRIS WILSON: So today, in both
of those demos, you can't

716
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,650
actually save the output
of it, [? trivially. ?]

717
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,870
You can use a loopback audio
output and record it with

718
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,450
different software, but
it's not built in.

719
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:36,300
Today, I believe we don't have
any way natively to record it

720
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,780
and encode it into one
of those formats &mdash;

721
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,860
into OGG or WAV or MP3 &mdash;

722
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,830
but that's certainly something
we've discussed.

723
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,880
You could actually build a
JavaScript audio node that

724
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,460
captures data and stores that
in any form you want.

725
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,920
It can store it as just an
audio buffer, which, of

726
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,230
course, is trivial to store,
or write your own code to

727
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,590
re-encode it as an mp3, or
whatever format you want.

728
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,900
JAN LINDEN: So right now, that
would be the biggest problem.

729
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,920
And doing an encoding can
be fairly complex.

730
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,469
So JavaScript encoder &mdash;

731
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:14,110
there are potentials to
do that, absolutely.

732
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,610
The other way that is being
worked on, again, using the

733
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:21,400
Get User Media API,
as I mentioned &mdash;

734
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,239
that one will get a recording
function into it.

735
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,150
It's a [? standardization ?]

736
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,659
process right now to figure out
how, exactly, that should

737
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,690
be done, but that's
also in the works.

738
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,659
So then you can both record
directly what's coming in, but

739
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:39,350
also feed what's the output from
Web Audio API into a Get

740
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,420
User Media that can then
record or play out

741
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,551
whatever you want.

742
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:43,929
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

743
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:46,000
And Get User Media, also
very important

744
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,800
for WebRTC, of course.

745
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,110
JAN LINDEN: Exactly.

746
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,929
PETER LUBBERS: All
right, excellent.

747
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:54,949
Another question from Gerwin
Sturm from Vienna.

748
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:59,470
How does the Web Audio API
compare to the Audio Data API

749
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,650
available in Firefox?

750
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,040
Are there already libraries
to support both for

751
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,350
cross-browser support?

752
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,040
And will they be merged to one
standard in the long run?

753
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,720
Who wants to take that?

754
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,150
JAN LINDEN: Yeah.

755
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:14,980
So basically, I think Mozilla
has moved on from that.

756
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,830

757
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,500
The idea is that the Web Audio
API is the main API people are

758
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,840
working on in the future.

759
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,340
So that's where the focus
is on everybody's side.

760
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,860
But there is still &mdash;

761
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,440
for the Firefox data
API, there is the

762
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,420
potential to use it.

763
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,310
And there are JavaScript
libraries

764
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,960
that do connect both.

765
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,720
So you could use it.

766
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,060
But since it is based on doing
everything in JavaScript, it's

767
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,710
much more limited in terms of
what you can do in real time.

768
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,415
And therefore, not all
functionality that you can do

769
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:55,222
in Web Audio API is available
for the simple [? data ?]

770
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:55,610
API.

771
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,800
CHRIS WILSON: The Audio Data
API is really just about

772
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,420
getting audio input
and output.

773
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,150
It's not about providing a
routing and effects pipeline.

774
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,830
And so you can use it.

775
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,300
And there certainly
are libraries that

776
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,920
are using it today.

777
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,750
Mozilla has actually stated
publicly several times that

778
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,900
I've seen that audio data
is not something they're

779
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,710
interested in continuing.

780
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,930
They were working on a
MediaStreams audio proposal

781
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,140
for a while.

782
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:31,910
And a lot of the guidance
from that is folded into

783
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,370
the Web Audio API.

784
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,880
And they continue to work &mdash; we
all continue to work on that

785
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,540
in the Web Audio
working group.

786
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,064
PETER LUBBERS: Excellent.

787
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:43,510
A couple of other questions &mdash;
so how does Web

788
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,790
Audio relate to WebRTC?

789
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,560
We touched on it briefly
with Get User Media.

790
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,140
Will Web Audio eventually become
a component of WebRTC?

791
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,970
How do you see that
fitting together?

792
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,290
JAN LINDEN: No is the
simple answer.

793
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,440
They're both extremely important
separate APIs.

794
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,690
WebRTC &mdash;

795
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,400

796
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,240
that's my background.

797
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,960
I've been working with
RTC forever.

798
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,700
And I come from the company that
brought this technology

799
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,560
into Google.

800
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,550
Anyway, so I'm working
on that as well.

801
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:18,590
And that is evolving in its
own way and will become

802
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,330
everything you need for doing
real-time voice and video

803
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,310
communication.

804
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:28,430
Then you will add Web Audio
API to this, either at the

805
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,900
input or at the output.

806
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,990
So at the input, it can be
interesting to add effects.

807
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:39,570
So between the microphone and
the encoder that you will send

808
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,850
data to the other side in
WebRTC, there you can add, for

809
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,250
example, an effect so you sound
differently, or whatever

810
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,320
you want to do &mdash;

811
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,980
filtering and things
like that.

812
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,450
And then on the output, it's
really nice to be able to add

813
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,880
what Web Audio API can do in
terms of spatialization.

814
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,340
For example, if you think about
a conferencing solution

815
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,820
where you want different
participants to come from

816
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,600
different locations, that's
easy to do that way.

817
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,960
And again, add effects,
et cetera.

818
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,320
So actually, the way WebRTC
is being specced out and

819
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,580
designed, it's assumed that Web
Audio API will be there

820
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,840
and take care of these things.

821
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,630
So WebRTC will not include, for
example, spatialization,

822
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,610
because it's not needed.

823
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:24,670
So they are really working
together to accomplish the

824
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,490
goals of all the audio
you want to have.

825
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,890
PETER LUBBERS: Great.

826
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,720
Another question from
stephband &mdash;

827
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,340
so the obvious next step for
the vocoder is to give it

828
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,710
real-time input.

829
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,300
Where are we with being able
to send audio into

830
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,550
Chrome in real time?

831
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,990

832
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,100
It's on GitHub, right?

833
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,910
CHRIS WILSON: Well, no.

834
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,900
I've been pestering &mdash;

835
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,490
I'll put it politely
as pestering &mdash;

836
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,640
Jan and Chris about this for
probably about six months now.

837
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,990
And I think I've sent at least
two mails in the last couple

838
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,850
of weeks to Chris, saying, you
know, the instant you guys

839
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:10,160
have any build that has
audio input support,

840
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,060
please give it to me.

841
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,480
Because I'm going to
go immediately hook

842
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,600
it up to the vocoder.

843
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,460
It is coming.

844
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,470
It is something that the team's
actively working on and

845
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:24,030
hopefully will be at least
initially implemented pretty

846
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,240
quickly here.

847
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,660
But it's not quite there yet.

848
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,890
I will guarantee that I'll get
it into the vocoder as quickly

849
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,780
as possible.

850
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,600
JAN LINDEN: So the work is going
on right now, both on

851
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,110
the Web Audio side and the
WebRTC, because we want to do

852
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,090
both of these things.

853
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,710
But basically, the first case
we are implementing is this

854
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,260
case to get live audio
into Web Audio API.

855
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,070
And you never know exactly
when it's done.

856
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,435
But we're working as quickly
as possible,

857
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:55,590
and it's a high priority.

858
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,460
And we have people working
on it today.

859
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,930
PETER LUBBERS: Excellent.

860
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,460
All right, a question from
Jeff in Portland.

861
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,790
With Web Audio, can I play a
long audio file, like a song,

862
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,010
and synchronize JavaScript
events to be fired at certain

863
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,400
times in the song?

864
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,610
For example, having a function
that gets called when the

865
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,100
audio file reaches the
three-second mark &mdash;

866
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,855
something like that.

867
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:17,105
Is that possible?

868
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:19,440

869
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,920
CHRIS WILSON: So that's an
interesting use case.

870
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,410
I think that you'll probably
find the best way to do that

871
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:34,540
is to use tracks in the HTML5
audio element and then if you

872
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:40,260
want processing on top of that,
you can actually get the

873
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,380
output of an audio element
and push it into

874
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,520
the Web Audio graphs.

875
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,950
You can use that as a sound
source in Web Audio as well,

876
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,790
if you want reverb or something
on the audio file.

877
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,420

878
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,510
We don't actually have callbacks
from the functions.

879
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,290
Because the audio in the Web
Audio API is running on the

880
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,000
audio system clock, which may or
may not be the same as your

881
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,100
computer clock.

882
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,350
If you have a totally separate
audio interface internally, it

883
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:15,320
probably has literally a
separate crystal for the clock

884
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,260
to keep it stable.

885
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,310
And callbacks would actually
cause some interesting timing

886
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,560
challenges there.

887
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,710
But you can synchronize
JavaScript events fairly

888
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,000
easily, simply by saying, well,
this is going to happen

889
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,970
in 15 seconds.

890
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,790
So I'm going to set a callback
for 15 seconds.

891
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,330
But tracks is really the way
to do that inside the HTML5

892
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,760
audio element.

893
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,410
JAN LINDEN: And if you want to
do something like your own

894
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,070
analysis based on the
[? signal, ?] you can still

895
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,780
hook up the audio tag to the
Web Audio API, and then use

896
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,370
the JavaScript node to do your
analysis, and whatever you

897
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:58,880
want to fire on that.

898
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,420
PETER LUBBERS: So a couple final
questions here, then.

899
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,290
And if I missed any, I will go
back through the moderator and

900
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,610
answer everything that
we didn't get to.

901
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:11,310
But somebody was asking, will
there be a port of Auto-Tune

902
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,590
to the Web Audio API?

903
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,590

904
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,970
CHRIS WILSON: A super
interesting question.

905
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,800
So one of my multiple projects
that I have on my I Would Love

906
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,640
To Do This list is an
Auto-Tune-like effect.

907
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Although, of course, Auto-Tune
itself is pretty heavily

908
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,020
patented, I'm sure.

909
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,250
The concept of re-tuning
audio files is a

910
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,310
pretty powerful one.

911
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,730
The main reason that I haven't
gone too deeply looking into

912
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,120
it is, well, first of all,
pitch detection is hard.

913
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,980

914
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,500
I keep uncovering one more layer
of the onion of being on

915
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,470
my way to becoming a digital
signal processing engineer.

916
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,900
But it's still &mdash;

917
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,850
I get too deeply into the
technical papers that are all

918
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,500
equations, and I kind
of glaze over.

919
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,840
It's certainly &mdash;

920
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,110
anything that you could build in
digital signal processing,

921
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,310
you could push into Web Audio.

922
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:22,260
I'm hoping that we get some
kinds of that work done

923
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,060
relatively quickly.

924
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,740
I'm looking for volunteers,
too.

925
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,800
PETER LUBBERS: Excellent.

926
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,120
All right, so I think that
pretty much concludes it.

927
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,760
There was one question about
where we can get the

928
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,540
presentation.

929
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,850
So you showed, Chris, and of
course, I will be posting all

930
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:44,960
of the links for this
presentation on our Google

931
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,570
Chrome Developers
Google+ page.

932
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,480
So definitely check
there after.

933
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,910
And we'll have a link to all
of the material &mdash; so the

934
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:57,650
GitHub where Chris posted his
source, the presentation that

935
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,360
he gave it at I/O, which
has a lot more

936
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,420
information about Web Audio.

937
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,650
We'll also post there the next
event, when we're going to do

938
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,680
that, in a couple of weeks.

939
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,110
And well, I think that's about
it in terms of questions.

940
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,720
Like I said, we'll definitely
cover any

941
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,620
questions that we missed.

942
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,480
And we'll answer them.

943
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,600
Did you have any other questions
there on the &mdash;

944
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,776
JAN LINDEN: No, I think that
pretty much covered

945
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:22,730
[? everything. ?]

946
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:23,440
PETER LUBBERS: All right.

947
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,300
Well, with that, I'd like to
thank everyone for tuning in.

948
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,790
And I want to thank Chris
and Jan for the great

949
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:30,440
information &mdash;

950
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,280
excellent, excellent overview.

951
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,810
The next session will be
about how you can use

952
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:39,120
Web Audio in gaming.

953
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,550
We'll do that in
a couple weeks.

954
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,250
And in the meantime, follow
us on Google+

955
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,310
Chrome Developers Channel.

956
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,920
And that's it.

957
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,457
Thank you for tuning in.

958
00:44:49,457 --> 00:44:50,331
CHRIS WILSON: Thanks, guys.

959
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:50,770
JAN LINDEN: Thank you.
