00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,700
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: Hello.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,750
Good morning, everyone.

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,020
Welcome to the Making Money
on Google Play session.

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,320
My name is Brahim Elbouchikhi.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,960
I'm Product Manager for Commerce
on Google Play.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,340
And Bob Meese over there is
my colleague, who is from

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,216
Business Development
on Google Play.

9
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,790
All right, let's get started.

10
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,070
Oh &mdash; where's the clicker?

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,835
Clicker?

12
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:21,585
Oh, here.

13
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:21,910
Right.

14
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,373
Sorry.

15
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:23,623
OK.

16
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,030

17
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,190
So first, I wanted to start
by just saying thank you.

18
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,730
Over the past 12 months, we've
talked to a lot of you.

19
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,220
Got a lot of great
feedback that we

20
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,350
baked into the product.

21
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,180
A lot of the features that
you'll see next have really

22
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,430
been developing by working
with you, and

23
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,500
getting your feedback.

24
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,440
So let's continue that.

25
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,910
Let's continue that
conversation.

26
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,400
Keep sending the feedback &mdash;

27
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,330
the good, the bad, the ugly &mdash;

28
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,340
and we promise we'll keep
working on it, and making

29
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,530
things better.

30
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,750
We'll start off with the
office hours, which is

31
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,670
happening next.

32
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,770
So come on by the Google Play
office hours section, and

33
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,550
we'll talk there.

34
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,120
So the agenda for today, we'll
first share some data.

35
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,640
These are metrics that we feel
are interesting for you as you

36
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,390
build your business
on Google Play.

37
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,330
Well then give you
a product update.

38
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,070
These are features we've
launched recently and their

39
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,580
impact, as well as
things we look

40
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,370
forward to in the mid-term.

41
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,710
Finally, we'll talk about some
case studies about what some

42
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,700
of our most commercially
successful partners are doing.

43
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,180
And finally, we'll close out
with a Q&A at the office hours

44
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,220
by the Google Play section.

45
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,360
All right, so let's get started
with some data.

46
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,250
Last year, Chris Yeager
got on stage &mdash;

47
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,730
I think exactly this room &mdash;

48
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,120
and showed us the growth
trajectory of in-app.

49
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,790
It looked something
like ridiculous &mdash;

50
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,530
well, reversed, but growing
up to the right.

51
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,860
And we were very excited
about that growth.

52
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,750
This year, we've actually
done something even more

53
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,170
incredible, which is
that we multiplied

54
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,400
in-app revenue by seven.

55
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,700
So over the past 12 months,
there are very few industries,

56
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,400
countries, anything that grows
that fast over 12 months.

57
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,330
And is a testament to all the
work you've all been doing.

58
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,970
Users are engaged with the
applications you're building,

59
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,330
and they're willing to
pay for them, and are

60
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,380
really enjoying them.

61
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,570
And so that's just incredible.

62
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,880
So we wanted to look beyond the
number, and say what is

63
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,000
this telling us about the Google
Play and Android user?

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,740
And one thing we've learned &mdash;

65
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,040
and we've heard this a lot from
our Japanese partners &mdash;

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,740
which is omotenashi.

67
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,810
And what omotenashi means in
Japanese is essentially, it's

68
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,710
hospitality, but it's got
a bit of a deeper sense.

69
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,610
It's got more of a personalized
experience.

70
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,330
It's almost like not a buyer
and seller relationship.

71
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,500
It's a host and a guest.

72
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,530
And what this is is essentially
what in-app

73
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,460
represents, right?

74
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,180
I mean in-app is about getting
the user to enjoy the

75
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,110
application, to really get
immersed into it before

76
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,960
getting to monetization.

77
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,066
We've heard this a lot in all
sorts of sayings, where you

78
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,100
know, focus on user experience
and the money will follow.

79
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,210
And that's exactly what
in-app represents.

80
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,730
Now, in-app is not
for everyone.

81
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,840
And we've got very successful
subscription partners, as well

82
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,410
as paid app developers.

83
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,090
But if you're able to inject
some omotenashi in your

84
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,770
application, then please
do, and give it a try.

85
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,320
And that's the message
from this number.

86
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,310
Subscriptions launched about
12 months ago, as well.

87
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,310
And since launch, we're very
excited that the number of

88
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,270
subscribers has doubled
each quarter.

89
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,270
Now subscriptions have a pretty
high hurdle, right?

90
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,960
I mean, the user has to see
continuous value, they have to

91
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,870
commit to a recurring
subscription that's

92
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,870
ordering you in.

93
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,670
And so it's got a pretty high
hurdle for subscription.

94
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,840
But yet, we're seeing more and
more users taking that step.

95
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,920
And that's, again, because of
the applications and the

96
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,370
content you've all been
created for our users.

97
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,040
There's no better example today
than Pandora, which is a

98
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,300
partner that's now in the
top grossing list.

99
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,940
One of the few non-games that's
completely based on

100
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,190
subscriptions.

101
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,030

102
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,660
Now Android is a global
platform clearly.

103
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,250
And Google Play store
is exactly &mdash;

104
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,600
is equally global.

105
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,630
We have buyers in 134 markets.

106
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,190
So by pushing that button in
the Google Play Developer

107
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,710
Console, and pushing your app
for sale, you make it

108
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,750
available to buyers
in 134 countries.

109
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,810
This is unprecedented
distribution.

110
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,690
Never before has distribution
been this easy and efficient.

111
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,030
And for you as a developer,
wherever you are in a world &mdash;

112
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,930
whether you're a solo developer
or a multinational

113
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,850
corporation &mdash;

114
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,200
we take care of everything
for you.

115
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,329
And we just have to push the
button, and get your

116
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,030
application out there.

117
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,810
Now the countries that we've
overlaid on the map are those

118
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,300
that are &mdash; some of them are
probably already in your mind.

119
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,470
They're particularly large,
growing fast.

120
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,080
But there are also other
countries that we feel like

121
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,990
are going to play a big part
of the next 12 months.

122
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,460
And so we're excited
about that.

123
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,110
And we've launched a lot of
features around localization

124
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,480
and translation at I/O, so take
advantage of that, and

125
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,910
map them up to that set of
countries &mdash; the 134 &mdash;

126
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,730
and hopefully you'll see
success globally.

127
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,100
Tablets have been a big
part of Android

128
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,960
over the past 12 months.

129
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,140
And the way the conversation
generally goes is that we ask

130
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,260
you to optimize your
apps for tablets.

131
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,540
And as a business owner, you
look at the costs, and you

132
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,460
say, well, that's
additional cost.

133
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,320
Is that where I invest
my resources?

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,440
And I know you have very
limited resources like

135
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,840
everyone else.

136
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,620
And the number I want to share
with you today is that a

137
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,920
tablet monetizes at 1.7x
the rate of a phone.

138
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,440
So that additional cost of
optimizing your tablet &mdash;

139
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,990
your application for tablets
is well worthwhile.

140
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,820
And we want to see more from
developers doing just that.

141
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,000
We've launched a lot of features
on our end, as well &mdash;

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,300
what are the optimization tips
for tablets, or the guidelines

143
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,530
to help you do this, as well.

144
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,470
The other metric that's
interesting is recent platform

145
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,820
releases monetize at 2.2x
their prior versions.

146
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,120
So what this is telling us is,
again, as you build your

147
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,790
application, take advantage of
the latest platform features,

148
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,350
whether it is Google+ sign-in,
or all the APIs that launched

149
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,500
at I/O this week.

150
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,850
All of that coming together
actually has a tangible impact

151
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,800
on your revenue.

152
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,570
It is not just nice to have.

153
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,290
They might be actually
required for you.

154
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,390
And you can more than double
your revenue by actually

155
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,520
adopting these new features.

156
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,880
Next is, this is a very
intuitive message, right?

157
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,320
Higher-rated applications,
monetize better.

158
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,472
But I wanted to give you a sense
of just how much better.

159
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:20,940
If you go from one to two &mdash;

160
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,220
let's not talk about those.

161
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,880
But if you go from two- to
three-star, you're actually

162
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,040
almost doubling your revenue.

163
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,680
And then again, if you go from
three to four stars, you're

164
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,090
actually almost tripling
your revenue.

165
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,440
So the conversation we have
around quality, and reply to

166
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,930
reviews, and fixing bugs, and
good customer experience, and

167
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,890
good support &mdash;

168
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,270
all of that has now a tangible
impact on your revenue.

169
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,850
And that's what we're going to

170
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,290
demonstrate with these metrics.

171
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,130
Finally, as it was mentioned in
the keynote, over the past

172
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,010
year, we've more than doubled
average revenue per user.

173
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,220
This is even given the
incredible growth that Android

174
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,680
itself has been having &mdash;

175
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,440
900 million devices.

176
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,630
We've actually grown
ARPU by 2 and 1/2x.

177
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,180
This is the baseline metric
that every platform is

178
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,200
measured by &mdash;

179
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,130
how profitable are we for you.

180
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,290
And this is really exciting
for us, this particular

181
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:11,770
development.

182
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,400
And it's a testament, again, to
the type of experiences you

183
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,220
have been creating, and
how engaging and

184
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,840
immersing they have been.

185
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,410
So we'll go now into the
product update portion.

186
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,180
And I know it might be obvious,
or it might be

187
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,550
intuitive, but I always like
to start with a baseline

188
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,580
understanding of our mission.

189
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,760
Everybody &mdash; we've got a bunch of
people who work on payments

190
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,500
who are sprinkled
around the room.

191
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,300
All of us, we show up to work
every day because we want to

192
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,880
make our developer successful.

193
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,130
And in the context of payments,
we want to make sure

194
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,980
we maximize your income.

195
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,930
So when you work hard and
build an application &mdash;

196
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,230
an awesome application &mdash;

197
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,550
we want to make sure you're
getting the most

198
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,960
value out of that work.

199
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,670
That's just a baseline
understanding.

200
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,490
That's why we show up
to work every day.

201
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,070
And a lot of us, that's our
goal and objective.

202
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,220
So with that in mind, again, I
like to think of things in

203
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,560
terms of frameworks that just
simplify the conversation.

204
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,210
In this case, I picked a really
simple framework.

205
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,780
We try to maximize your income,
which means we're

206
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,330
going to increase your sales
and reduce your costs.

207
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,030
So our conversation going
forward is going to be around

208
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,110
in this context &mdash;

209
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,890
how are we maximizing your
sales, and how are we reducing

210
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,060
your costs in order to
maximize your income?

211
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,720
We've also talked
to you about, so

212
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,710
what drives your sales.

213
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,340
And you told us a
bunch of things.

214
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,710
One is the number of devices out
there &mdash; how many tablets

215
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,800
do we have.

216
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,080
The other thing was
how many markets

217
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,230
you're targeting, right?

218
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,789
So if we're growing really fast
in a particular region

219
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,760
but you're actually not
localizing to it or tailoring

220
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,440
the experience to it,
you're not really

221
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,190
benefiting from that.

222
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,190
The other aspect is the quality
of your application.

223
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,980
We just saw, if you go from
three to four, you're tripling

224
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,500
your revenue.

225
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,600
Your aspect is, how many
buyers do we have?

226
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,340
How many credit cards
do we have on file?

227
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,960
How many carrier billing
accounts do we have?

228
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,800
And then the purchase
experience &mdash;

229
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,880
how smooth is it?

230
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,460
How well does it convert?

231
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,780
This all impacts your sales.

232
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,120
And finally, all of
these things that

233
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,750
happen after the fact.

234
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,680
What if there's cancellations
because of a poor user

235
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,270
experience?

236
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,750
The user did not get the item
they purchased, and then they

237
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,370
call, and that becomes a
poor user experience.

238
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,300
So all of these things
drive your sales.

239
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,650
Now in terms of cost,
you've told us

240
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,510
about three big buckets.

241
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,590
These are things we've talked
about in terms of tablets and

242
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,420
optimizing for them,
or adopting

243
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,310
new platform features.

244
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,630
It's engineering work, right?

245
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,030
You've got to have engineers,
and you've got to have QA,

246
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,200
you've got to have back
office and accounting.

247
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,470
You've got your acquisition
costs.

248
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,580
Right, so marketing, paid
installs, whatever it is.

249
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,400
And then you have your
support costs.

250
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,530
So these are the three
buckets that your

251
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,360
costs largely fit into.

252
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,580
So with that in mind, I want to
show with you some things

253
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,530
we did to help in each
of those areas.

254
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,720
So more forms of payment.

255
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,540
This clearly comes
up all the time.

256
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,030
What have we done
over the past 12

257
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,100
months to address that?

258
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,810
First off is a Google
Play gift card.

259
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,060
It actually only launched
in July of last year.

260
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,820
And since then, it's &mdash;

261
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,750
woo, that's right.

262
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,240
BOB MEESE: Right.

263
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,340
Somebody's happy.

264
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,050
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: It only
launched in July of last year.

265
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,870
And since then, it's become
incredibly successful for us.

266
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,100
And it's omnipresent in
US retail locations.

267
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,560
It's in the UK now.

268
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,810
You will see us continue
to invest in the

269
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,070
Google Play gift card.

270
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,740
The whole prepaid form of
payment is critical to us.

271
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,720
The other aspect is we
launch campaigns.

272
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,420
And what campaigns are
essentially &mdash; in this case, if

273
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,790
you bought a Galaxy S III, you
get a free Galaxy S III &mdash;

274
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,560
which is awesome &mdash;

275
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,830
but also you got $50 to
spend on Google Play.

276
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,380
And what this does is, one, it
injects money that gets spent

277
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,620
on your applications.

278
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,240
And two, it lowers a hurdle for
users to go from a free

279
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,190
app buyer &mdash;

280
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,180
consumer &mdash;

281
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,810
to actually a purchaser.

282
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,770
And our experiments have shown
that when a user makes one,

283
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,380
two, three purchases, they're
much more likely to make their

284
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,220
fourth and fifth even when
their credit is over.

285
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,720
Finally, carrier billing.

286
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,730
And the exciting number I want
to share with you today is

287
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,200
that 50% of Google Play
thirty-day actives are now on

288
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,610
carrier support carrier
billing.

289
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,450
And what that means is that they
are one button-click away

290
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,890
from becoming buyers.

291
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,200
They don't have to
type numbers, and

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,680
no expiration dates.

293
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,210
You just have to enable
it, and then

294
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,420
they can start buying.

295
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,790
And this is a really critical
number for us.

296
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,750
And as a background, if you're
not aware of what carrier

297
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,670
billing is, it's essentially
the ability to put your

298
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,470
purchases on your
monthly bill.

299
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,460
And this is something that's
unique to Google Play, and

300
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,540
that we've invested a lot in
the technology behind it.

301
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,500
So the other thing you said
is the purchase flow.

302
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,050
We've heard a lot about our
purchase flow in the past.

303
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,980
I don't know if you've been
through the new store, as well

304
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,280
as the new purchase flow, but
that's a really exciting

305
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,160
development for us.

306
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,910
And a lot of the design came in
from feedback you gave us,

307
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,410
which was that you want the
purchase flow to be

308
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,900
contextual.

309
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,270
You want it to be fast, and
you want it to be simple.

310
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,930
So we did just that.

311
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,200
And in addition to that, we
made it a lot faster.

312
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
So in this particular client
release that came out a few

313
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,030
weeks ago, we've seen a
35% drop in latency.

314
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,740
In addition to that, we're
seeing really good user

315
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,490
feedback, and we're seeing a
pickup in conversion, as well.

316
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,520

317
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,680
Now let's shift gears
to costs.

318
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,140
We've heard a lot
from you around

319
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,680
accounting and back office.

320
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,830
And if you're a small developer,
you might not worry

321
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,570
too much about this.

322
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,280
But for our large partners,
there's a big problem.

323
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,960
You couldn't get your reports
on a timely basis.

324
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,690
You couldn't get them

325
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,790
programatically out of our database.

326
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,090
And so, we've done just that.

327
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,670
So with the rollout of the
Google Wallet Merchant Center

328
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,820
now &mdash; which is, if you don't
have it, you should get it in

329
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,950
a few weeks &mdash;

330
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,940
you'll be able to use a very
simple script to download all

331
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,620
your monthly reports, and
injects them into your

332
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,910
backend, and do whatever
you want with them &mdash;

333
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,430
most likely reconcile.

334
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,510
The other aspect is
support costs.

335
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,660
And the thing about support
costs is that if you look at

336
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,850
the top level cost of lost
purchases, you might feel

337
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,990
that, well, it's bad, but
it's not terrible.

338
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,770
But the impact of support
goes well beyond that.

339
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,200
One is there is the cost of the
lost sale, and there's a

340
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,330
fixed cost of supporting
that call, right?

341
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,630
So if somebody calls 10 minutes
to support that user,

342
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,960
that's a lot of money.

343
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,080
But the worst part is you've
acquired that buyer with a

344
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,620
certain lifetime value
assumption, right?

345
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,360
And what this does to it is
it truncates its lifetime.

346
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,710
It cuts it short.

347
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,790
And so your math &mdash;

348
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,530
as you're looking at, is
this going to make it &mdash;

349
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,650
does this add up for me, it
really gets messed up.

350
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,750
And so support, as little as
you might not pay a lot of

351
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,370
attention to it, is actually
critical to your revenue and

352
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,830
sales &mdash; to your costs
and sales.

353
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,770
And what's the exciting
metric here is IAB v3.

354
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,640
IAB v3 launched in December.

355
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,860
And since then, Gamevil has seen
a 90% drop in customer

356
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,100
contact rates for games where
they have implemented IAB v3.

357
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,990
So there was a talk on
Wednesday about it.

358
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,370
Please go watch it on YouTube.

359
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,700
And thank that person over there
for designing IAB v3.

360
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,490
So anyways.

361
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,240
Basically, this is
really awesome.

362
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,450
You just need to do it.

363
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,660
So in-app order status
API &mdash; this is another

364
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,070
big ask from you &mdash;

365
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,670
which is essentially the ability
for you to take that

366
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,770
purchase token that we send you
back, and turn around and

367
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,870
verify the status of
that purchase.

368
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,900
This is for two reasons.

369
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,770
You could do it for either very
fine authenticity of the

370
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,660
purchase, or just the state.

371
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,090
And we're launching this in
a few weeks worldwide.

372
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,740
So all of our developers will
have access to this.

373
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,340
And it should help a lot with
reconciling your purchases,

374
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,885
and even preventing fraud.

375
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:38,140

376
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,570
The other thing is in-app
billing testing.

377
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,780
You've probably heard this
already, but we're now

378
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,670
simplifying in-app billing
testing by allowing your

379
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,050
licensed test accounts &mdash; the one
you already configured in

380
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,840
the Google Play Developer
Console &mdash;

381
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,990
to actually make purchases
without being charged.

382
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,600
Everything else is the same.

383
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,130
Just no more holds, no
bins, no delays.

384
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,720
Just the same, but none
of the bad stuff.

385
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,040
And we think this is going to
be super excited, super

386
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,270
helpful in streamlining your
experience in testing, and

387
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,370
making sure you're not
wasting time stuck in

388
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,090
those sorts of things.

389
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,600
When you see that message that
says, this is a test purchase,

390
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,850
you know that you're not
actually being charged as it

391
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,110
says in the remainder
of the sentence.

392
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,760

393
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,590
All right, so to summarize.

394
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,800
So for your sales, we've got
50% of our users now on

395
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,390
carrier billing.

396
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,000
We've got the Google
Play gift cards.

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,720
We've got promo campaigns.

398
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,150
And we've got a faster,
better purchase flow.

399
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,060
For your costs, we've
got a programmatic

400
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,940
access to your reports.

401
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,040
Easy in-app testing.

402
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,370
Better user experience
with IAB v3.

403
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,500
And order status check API to
prevent fraud, as well as

404
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,940
reconcile your purchases.

405
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,070
So this is the summary list of
things that we've done, or we

406
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,050
are doing in the next few weeks
to help you maximize

407
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,300
your income.

408
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,200

409
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,660
So looking forward a little
bit, you can see us invest

410
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,490
more heavily in Google
Play gift card.

411
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,480
We are going to push it into
our biggest markets, and

412
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,630
you'll see us continue
to do that.

413
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,860
The next thing we'll do
is carrier billing.

414
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,600
It's in 12 countries today.

415
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,020
See us push that further over
the next few months, and over

416
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,370
the next 12 months.

417
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,880
All right, those add up.

418
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,760
And then the purchase
experience, right?

419
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,310
So we've already made a huge

420
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,090
improvement in our last release.

421
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,220
But we're actually going
to go even further.

422
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,000
The one thing we've done so
far &mdash; the one thing we've done

423
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,200
really critical is that we've
instrumented the purchase flow

424
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,460
so that we can analyze it and
study it, and continue to

425
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,500
improve it very quickly.

426
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,030
So look for us to do a lot more
experimentation and lots

427
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,980
more fine-tuning.

428
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,840
So when you send us a buyer &mdash;
when you get a user to commit

429
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,050
to making a purchase
on your app &mdash;

430
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,920
we want to convert as many of
those as possible, unless they

431
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,440
change their mind.

432
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,820
And so, look for us to do
a lot more of that.

433
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,710
And look for us to support
more forms of payment.

434
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,030
Gift cards are just
the beginning.

435
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,720
And finally, seller support
in more countries.

436
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,310
We're all &mdash;

437
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,680
one of your objectives
and missions of all

438
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,380
of us is that anyone &mdash;

439
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,690
anyone around the world &mdash;

440
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,450
can make a living
on Google Play.

441
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,250
And we want to get there.

442
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,730
It's taking a long time.

443
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,640
It's slower than we would
like it to be, as well.

444
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,119
But we do want to get to the
point where anyone around the

445
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,900
planet can code an awesome
app, and make a

446
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,950
living out of it.

447
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,810
And we'll get there.

448
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,369
So why is it an exciting
year ahead?

449
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,940
I think it's a convergence of
the few things for us on Play.

450
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,500
First of all, we've got a
global payment switch.

451
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,710
We're really getting
to the point

452
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,420
where we've got [? fops ?]

453
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,370
in many, many countries, and
that's going to really help

454
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,860
with our conversion.

455
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,400
The next thing is that we're
seeing a higher buying

456
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,770
engagement, as you've seen
in the number before.

457
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,220
Across the board, whether it's
in-app, subscriptions, or paid

458
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,930
apps, users are willing to buy,
and willing to pay for

459
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,550
the experiences you're
creating.

460
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,190
And that's really good
news for us.

461
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,620
Finally, we are really putting
the final pieces together for

462
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,690
world class commerce
infrastructure

463
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,980
and developer tools.

464
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,040
We want to get you back to doing
the things that you do

465
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,370
well and do best, which is
building awesome applications.

466
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,540
We're going to take you away
from spending time trying to

467
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,320
figure out why your account is
blocked for testing purposes,

468
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
or why you have to download
these reports in

469
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,380
some way or the other.

470
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,060
We want to do all of that, and
make sure you do what you do

471
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,660
best, which is build awesome
applications.

472
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,380
That's all from me.

473
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,980
I'm going to hand it over to
Bob, who is going to cover a

474
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,124
few case studies.

475
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:21,000
BOB MEESE: All right.

476
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,840
Thanks, Brahim.

477
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,700
And hello, everyone.

478
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,760
So to get the growth rates
that we're seeing, we're

479
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,100
clearly doing a lot to help
support that growth.

480
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,740
But much of the work is also
being done by our developers.

481
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,310
And so this section of
presentation will really focus

482
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,380
on the work of those
great developers.

483
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,830
And we're focusing specifically
on the most

484
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,750
commercially successful
developers.

485
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,100
And by commercially successful,
I mean the

486
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,650
developers that are not just
building great products that

487
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,230
their users love, that are
being installed in large

488
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,780
numbers in many cases, but these
are the developers that

489
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,842
are making money
on Google Play.

490
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:55,430
And I'll focus on two key
parts in this section.

491
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,390
So one will just be to help you
understand more about what

492
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,850
these developers are doing.

493
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,000
And then I'd also really like to
focus on how you can apply

494
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,775
some of these lessons to
your own businesses.

495
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,700

496
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,710
So as Brahim said, we've seen a
7x increase in the last year

497
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,370
in in-app revenue.

498
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,350
Signs of in-app revenue growth
are all over the Play Store.

499
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,410
If you look at the top grossing
apps right now, all

500
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,190
of the top grossing apps
are free to play.

501
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,470
But with every rule there's
always an exception.

502
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,900
And so we have a fun give
we like to play

503
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,210
called Where's Minecraft.

504
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,670
And so there it is, down
there at number 22.

505
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,810
And so we are not saying you
need to push everything for

506
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,980
free to play.

507
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,330
Minecraft is an amazing game.

508
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,960
It's an iconic brand with
a very loyal following.

509
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,550
We think it'll continue
to be successful.

510
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,930
So we are not asking you to
follow the crowd to do that.

511
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,150
However, also recognize
the dominant trend

512
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,730
towards free to play.

513
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,910
It's very important to recognize
that the bar for

514
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,600
success for a paid title
in the top grossing

515
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,850
charts is very high.

516
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,370

517
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,030
More than anything, the trend
that we see is developers

518
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,280
allowing users to defer
that payment decision.

519
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,110
We see a three-step funnel
to monetization.

520
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,070
So the first step is really
around acquisition.

521
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,400
And so this is about expanding
this top of the funnel as wide

522
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,720
as you possibly can, getting as
many users you can to press

523
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,110
that install button.

524
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,840
The install counts on Google
Play are public within a

525
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,750
certain band.

526
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,730
And just go check out some of
your favorite paid apps and

527
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,450
free apps, and check out the
large, large difference in the

528
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,960
large number of free installs
that happen on Google Play.

529
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,400
Second, retention &mdash;

530
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,320
we think this is really an

531
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,430
under-appreciated part of the funnel.

532
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,010
It's part of the omotenashi
that Brahim

533
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,230
was mentioning earlier.

534
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,820
It's an area where our smartest
developers are

535
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,050
spending more and more
of their time.

536
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,440
And the thing we need to focus
on here is really on earning

537
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,310
the ability to ask those
users for money.

538
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,990
It's not something that you
can take for granted.

539
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,200
For example, if I asked all of
you to rate my talk a couple

540
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,390
minutes to it right now, you
might ask for a little more

541
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,960
time to see like, hey, what's
this guy actually going to

542
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,720
talk about, right?

543
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,340
And the same sort of principle
applies here.

544
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,550
So have your users get into your
product, provide value to

545
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,930
them, have them coming
back over time.

546
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,770
And clearly, we've seen signs
that users are more likely to

547
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,460
pay after they've had
an experience.

548
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,830
And then finally, obviously
pressing that Buy button and

549
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,060
monetization.

550
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,240
And what we've found is, it's
very important, and there's a

551
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,240
lot of differences in terms of
when and how developers ask

552
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,460
users to pay.

553
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,390
And I'll do a first case study
that introduces these three

554
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,640
principles.

555
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,450

556
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,750
So Kiwi is an Android-focused

557
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,510
developer led by Omar Siddiqui.

558
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,360
Omar's actually to be joining
us for the office hours

559
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,410
session afterwards.

560
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,640
And "Shipwrecked" has been their
most successful game on

561
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,600
Google Play.

562
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,270
It will also be the subject
of the case study in the

563
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,580
following slides.

564
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,890
Kiwi has three other games
on Google Play, including

565
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,390
"Monsterama Park," "Brightwood
Adventures," and "Monsterama

566
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,916
Planet," which was recently
released.

567
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,680
And when we spoke with them,
they said for acquisition,

568
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
really invest in your
Play store page.

569
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,870
It sounds basic, but the
little things matter.

570
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,010
You

571
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,330
See here in the description,
"Millions of players agree

572
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,930
that "Shipwrecked: Lost Island,"
an Editor's Choice

573
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,710
app, is one of the top free
games on Android." In just a

574
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,110
few words, they communicate a
lot of powerful principles.

575
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,090
It's one of the first
experiences that a user has

576
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,650
with your application, and these
words really create a

577
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,500
powerful impression.

578
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,990
Also on the right,
you see videos.

579
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,080
We found that videos is a very
powerful way to communicate

580
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,280
the value of your product, and
it helps differentiate you

581
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,110
against all of the other
products that do not have

582
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,060
videos in their titles.

583
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,270
Second, retention, as we said,
is very important.

584
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,370
Here when you think of
retention, think about

585
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,712
rewarding those user actions
that you want

586
00:22:44,712 --> 00:22:45,890
your users to take.

587
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,970
So on here on the left, as you
see that, it's very important

588
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,560
to have daily retention.

589
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,380
And you see your award, a
daily login bonus, that

590
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,630
rewards those players for taking
the actions you want

591
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,970
them to take.

592
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,100
On the right, you see
a leveling up.

593
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,680
You see the time and the effort
that your users are

594
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,120
spending on that application,
being rewarded through new

595
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,570
content and new features
being unlocked, and

596
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,520
other rewards happening.

597
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,840
Further on retention &mdash;

598
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,320
keeping the content fresh, and
unlocking big, new content.

599
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,470
In this case, a full
new island &mdash;

600
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,640
Atlantis, in this case &mdash;

601
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,530
allows your users to stay
engaged with the game &mdash; or,

602
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,650
the application &mdash;

603
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,780
and explore all of
this new content.

604
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,520
Also, you can even think about
reinventing the user

605
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,660
experience.

606
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,220
When "Shipwrecked" first
launched, it was really

607
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,100
focused around exploration
and collection.

608
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,730
After launch, they added a
trading mechanic, which users

609
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,700
actually loved.

610
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,330
It was a bit of a risk, but
users love this, and they keep

611
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,930
coming back to the game
over and over.

612
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,590

613
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,730
On the topic of monetization,
we have found that

614
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,550
merchandising really matters.

615
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,820
I think this monkey's
great here.

616
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,930
He's pointing out this
"arr-some" deal, if you can't

617
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,650
see the little text there.

618
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,290
But 24 gold for $2.99 &mdash;

619
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,070
who can beat that?

620
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,480
You see below you can go to the
full store, but why not

621
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,090
pull out one of the most
attractive offers, and put it

622
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,980
right there and make it
easy for users to buy.

623
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,560

624
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,210
And so, as you saw with Kiwi,
acquisition is about improving

625
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,300
your Play Store page.

626
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,650
Retention is about rewarding
the user behaviors that you

627
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,670
want to promote, and about
reinventing the user

628
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,920
experience.

629
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,860
And monetization and
merchandising matters.

630
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,010
But it's not just enough to
go linearly through this.

631
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,620
What we're seeing the most
successful developers on

632
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,570
Google Play do is they create
a virtuous cycle by feeding

633
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,650
back the acquisition several
different ways.

634
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,900
So those developers that are
able to find success and make

635
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,010
money on Google Play can
reinvest those earnings

636
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,620
through paid user acquisition
to fuel future

637
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,870
growth of their products.

638
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,230

639
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,880
Similarly, those developers that
have a great number of

640
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,680
retained users can cross-promote
those users &mdash;

641
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,940
especially the developers that
have multiple titles &mdash;

642
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,980
back into acquisition.

643
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,740
Then finally, those developers
that are fortunate enough to

644
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,860
reach the top list.

645
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,970
That becomes a self-fulfilling
cycle.

646
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,130
You need a lot of installs to
get there, but you get a lot

647
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,360
of installs from being there.

648
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,960
And now I'll talk about some
of these concepts with the

649
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,550
other case studies.

650
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,070
The second one we'll introduce
today's DeNA, and the game

651
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,180
we'll mostly focus on is their
successful game, "Blood

652
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,400
Brothers." They have a couple of
other hit titles, including

653
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,220
"Marvel War of Heroes," and
"Rage of Bahamut," which was a

654
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,000
clear breakout hit
through 2012.

655
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,330
DeNA also has six other games
in the top 100 top grossing.

656
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,610
So because they have so many
successful titles, they really

657
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,790
focus on cross-promotion.

658
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,600
In this case, I was playing
"Blood Brothers" on the left.

659
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,640
While I was playing, I received
this promotion &mdash;

660
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,820
"Play Marvel, and receive 50
MobaCoin." It's a way for them

661
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,030
to target a very attractive
user base &mdash;

662
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,660
the user's who are playing their
existing games, and use

663
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,660
them to acquire them for the new
games they're launching.

664
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,560

665
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,220
It's also important for
attention to provide very

666
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,170
clear objectives.

667
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,890
The essential objective in the
game, "Blood Brothers," is a

668
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,920
card collection mechanic.

669
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,110
It's all around strengthening
your characters, which they

670
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,950
call Familiars.

671
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,780
All of the core game
loops in the game

672
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,260
support this core objective.

673
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,730
It's a very powerful thing.

674
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,250
They focus you on a single core
objective, and then you

675
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,350
have a game loop of adventuring,
battling,

676
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,770
leveling up your characters &mdash;

677
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,450
all feeling back into that one
objective of strengthening

678
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,150
your characters.

679
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,380
Even as you add more complexity
to the game, when

680
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,120
you battle and you win, you
capture a character.

681
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,510
There's a variety of ways you
can combine these characters

682
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,030
all back towards that central
objective of strengthening

683
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,390
your characters.

684
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,720
And one thing that's
particularly worth calling out

685
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,320
is DeNA's success with events.

686
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,760
So events are variations on
the standard gameplay that

687
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,470
happen for a very limited
amount of time &mdash;

688
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,810
a fixed duration &mdash;

689
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,180
that provide important
rewards.

690
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,320
And in this case, they provide
rare characters, which are

691
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,590
extremely valuable within
the context of the game.

692
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,980
Again, feeding back to
strengthening your characters.

693
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,630
But the importance here is
creating that sense of urgency

694
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,560
through having a limited time
window and providing something

695
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,000
that is very valuable.

696
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,505
And that combination
is very powerful.

697
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:08,135

698
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:09,770
And you say, how
powerful is it?

699
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,380

700
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,420
The monetization in that game
actually doubles on an average

701
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,600
revenue-per-user basis
during these events.

702
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,350
So there's a clear payoff to
finding the ways to make your

703
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,900
game work for users, to create
that sense of urgency, to give

704
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,790
the players that great
experience, to provide a

705
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,590
slightly different gaming
experience, to give them a

706
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,740
different way to interact
with other users.

707
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,570
And clearly, there's a financial
reward for doing

708
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,820
this within the game.

709
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,600

710
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,940
The next one I'll talk about
is Kabam, another very

711
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,920
successful developer that has
moved just last year from the

712
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,080
web over to mobile.

713
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,270
So in Kabam's case, we're going
to focus their case

714
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,600
study on "Kingdoms of Camelot:
Battle for the North." They

715
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,680
also have several other
successful titles on Google

716
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,630
Play, including "The Hobbit,"
"Arcane Empires," and the soon

717
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,880
to be released "Fast
and Furious 6."

718
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,380
One of the lessons from Kabam
was always be testing.

719
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,190
Kabam focuses on core
gaming users.

720
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,300
Core gaming users monetize
much better than

721
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,460
your average user.

722
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,340
And as a result of being able to
earn that revenue, they're

723
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,030
able to reinvest those earnings
back into paid user

724
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,200
acquisition.

725
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,940
In this case here, they're doing
a split-test on several

726
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,500
different campaigns.

727
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,080
On the campaign on the left, you
can see a campaign focused

728
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,040
around characters and concept.

729
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,120
On the campaign on the right,
you can see a campaign much

730
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,570
more focused around a realistic

731
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,680
depiction of gameplay.

732
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,820
Kabam is always testing, and
so based on the relative

733
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,940
success of each of these
campaigns, they can add more

734
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,870
resources to one, take them away
from another, and be very

735
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,380
flexible in growing their
overall user base.

736
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,510
In terms of retention, as I
mentioned, Kabam recently came

737
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,240
from web over to mobile, and
they quickly realized the

738
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,610
difference in those users.

739
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,460
The mobile sessions were
much more frequent.

740
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,460
There were many more sessions
through the course of the day,

741
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,920
but they were also shorter.

742
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,160
And so, one of the first things
they did was change the

743
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,980
way that they did the
content refreshes to

744
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,540
make them more frequent.

745
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,880
You can also see visually
depicted here on the left,

746
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,130
that's the web game.

747
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,070
And there's a very rich

748
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,340
landscape of gameplay elements.

749
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,430
Many of the major elements
are spread further apart.

750
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,680
It's really designed to be
played with a mouse and

751
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,160
keyboard obviously.

752
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,720
And on the right, you have a
much more streamlined game

753
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,410
experience on mobile.

754
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,570
Many of the user actions are
able to be taken right from

755
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,870
your thumb in a very easy way.

756
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,220

757
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,530
Now monetization &mdash;

758
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,210
Kabam really focuses on
providing visual consistency.

759
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,350
As I said, it's really important
how you ask your

760
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,760
users for payment.

761
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,500
And their case, they want to
minimize any confusion, and so

762
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,790
here through all three screens,
you can see the exact

763
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,840
identical presentation
throughout.

764
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,410

765
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,720
The final case study today
will be on Pandora.

766
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,770
Pandora's a company that's
extremely well known.

767
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,470
It hardly needs an
introduction.

768
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,160
They're the leading internet
radio service.

769
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,190
Kabam is one of those lucky few
apps that has reached the

770
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,820
top of the lists, and
so from there &mdash;

771
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,830
it's hard to get there.

772
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,260
But when you do, it's
quite powerful.

773
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,500
But what I really want to focus
on with Pandora is a

774
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,300
recent change that they've
made around monetization.

775
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,470
And so as Brahim alluded to
earlier, as you can see in the

776
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,090
chart here, something
changed in February.

777
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,290
And what was that change?

778
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,840
So the thing that changed
in February is Pandora

779
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,680
implemented our in-app billing
subscriptions.

780
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,060
Previously before that time,
while the revenue was in,

781
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,860
payments were much flatter, you
had to go actually from

782
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,650
your mobile device over to
Pandora on the web and sign up

783
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,600
for a subscription there
to be able to use the

784
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,040
subscriptions on mobile.

785
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,790
By reducing all that payment
friction, by allowing the user

786
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,350
to purchase directly from the
mobile device, they saw a big

787
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,690
bump in overall payments.

788
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,310
But it doesn't stop there.

789
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,510
It gets even better
the next month.

790
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,220
Because what happened here?

791
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,840
So at this time, Pandora still
allowed users 40 free hours of

792
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,750
mobile listening per month.

793
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,280
But for those users who reached
those 40 free hours

794
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,680
and still wanted more, Pandora
asked them to pay.

795
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,370
And that's what really
allows this.

796
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,390
And omotenashi is the theme.

797
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,850
It's funny, that mix of &mdash;

798
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,430
you have users.

799
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,810
You're providing a great
value to users.

800
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,720
For free, you're providing
40 free hours of mobile

801
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,250
listening per month.

802
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,210
But yet there's so many users
who want to help you build

803
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,130
your business.

804
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,410
They love the product so
much that they're happy

805
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,660
to pay at that time.

806
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,990

807
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,270
So in summary, when you're
thinking about acquisition,

808
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,390
think about improving your Play
Store page, and investing

809
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,630
in your Play Store page.

810
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,710
Consider cross-promotion,
especially with multiple

811
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,470
different applications.

812
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,480
For those applications that
are making money, reinvest

813
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,740
those earnings for paid
user acquisition.

814
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,935
And of course, everybody
wants to get at

815
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:54,390
the top of the charts.

816
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,520
For retention, really think
about rewarding the user

817
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,280
actions that you're trying
to promote, and consider

818
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,305
reinventing your user
experience.

819
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:06,230

820
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,770
It's really important to provide
clear objectives to

821
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,870
users, and to support those
objectives with the overall

822
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,120
user experience.

823
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,230

824
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,330
Design for mobile &mdash;

825
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,130
it's important, and
users will notice.

826
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,630
And on to monetization.

827
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,300
The way that you merchandize
within your

828
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,000
products on mobile matters.

829
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,535
If you change new gameplay
mechanics, users will notice,

830
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:35,410
and you can drive
huge success.

831
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,470
Present a consistent
visual experience.

832
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,680
And finally, there's developers
that have charts

833
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,210
like this, and we're looking
forward to even more of these

834
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,260
in the coming year.

835
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,330
And so that concludes the
prepared part for our talk.

836
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,790
As we mentioned, following this
talk we'll be taking Q&A

837
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,310
in the office hour areas.

838
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,210
But I'd also like to point
out a few other &mdash;

839
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,720
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: We have
time, we'll do questions.

840
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,470
BOB MEESE: Yeah, we can do a few
now, but we would like to

841
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,170
specifically point out a few
that we thought were

842
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,350
particularly noteworthy, and
valuable for your time.

843
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,300
And then most importantly, we'd
like to say thank you.

844
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,400
We'd like to thank all of
you for your time today.

845
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,295
We'd like to thank some
of the developers who

846
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:14,940
were part of this.

847
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,240
I see Kabam here in
the front row.

848
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,800
Thank you, guys, very much.

849
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,840
And then thank you to all of the
developers on Google Play.

850
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,210
It's been an amazing past
year, but the future, I

851
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,780
believe, is even better.

852
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,690
AUDIENCE: I have one
quick question.

853
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,056
Can I ask now?

854
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:35,180
[APPLAUSE]

855
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,220
You said something about the
carrier billing apart

856
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,030
from the gift card.

857
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,810
What is the carrier billing?

858
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,210
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: So carrier
billing is basically

859
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,080
the ability for the user to put
their purchases on their

860
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,220
monthly bill.

861
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,200
So the same bill you get from
your provider, you would just

862
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,790
put all your purchases
on that bill.

863
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,920
And so, it just adds
up to that.

864
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,330
AUDIENCE: Oh, so you're ordering
international calling

865
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,630
or something, is it used
for that, or what?

866
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,220
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: It's just
for buying in-app products.

867
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,330
So when you're, let's say,
playing a game, or you're even

868
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,780
subscribing to Pandora, you
can put your Pandora

869
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,095
subscription on your
monthly phone bill.

870
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:07,345
AUDIENCE: Oh, that bill.

871
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,810

872
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,110
AUDIENCE: Hello.

873
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:13,250
I'm having a little bit of time
just judging business

874
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,540
models, and evaluating business
models when I'm

875
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,250
thinking about developing
apps.

876
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,370
Like for example, you're talking
about 7x improvements,

877
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,500
5x improvements, 2x
improvements, and all that

878
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,790
sounds great but 0 times
5 is still 0.

879
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,610
So the question is, what does
it mean to be in the hundred

880
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,920
top grossing apps?

881
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,139
Is there any charts of like
revenue, actual dollars per

882
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,710
month, if you are a certain
percentile of your app in that

883
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,020
top grossing list?

884
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,780
I'm having a really hard
time finding useful

885
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,380
data in that direction.

886
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,300
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: So I would
say that's probably like

887
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,060
partner data.

888
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,600
Like we generally can't share
information like that about

889
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,989
how much revenue our
people make in

890
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,870
our different rankings.

891
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,389
It varies a lot depending
on what type of

892
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,360
application is up there.

893
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,699
Clearly, if you're &mdash;

894
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,470
if you have a $9.99 a month
subscription, and you're on

895
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,810
the top grossing, that gets
you up there faster.

896
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,110
And it just &mdash;

897
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,030
it varies a lot, so it's kind of
hard for us to give a firm

898
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,850
number there.

899
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,870
AUDIENCE: Even if it's a
completely anonymous

900
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,880
statistics, like if your app
is in the top 2%, you can

901
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,630
expect, I don't know,
$3,000 a month?

902
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,840
BOB MEESE: You want more
of just what is

903
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,660
the data behind it?

904
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just very
rough guidelines.

905
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,440
Can I expect to make $30 a
month? $3,000 a month?

906
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,720
$300,000 a month, if I
have a top 2% app?

907
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,620
It's just really hard to
get a feeling for this.

908
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:28,680
BOB MEESE: Sure.

909
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,310
I mean if you're interested
enough, there's

910
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,100
data that's out there.

911
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,550
A number of the developers are
publicly traded, and so there

912
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,840
you can get a sense of what
their revenues are.

913
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,120
As Brahim said, it's challenging
for us to share

914
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,720
our partners' data.

915
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,500
We all have confidentiality
agreements.

916
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,110
We've tried as much as
possible through this

917
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,380
presentation to be as open, and
over time we become more

918
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,020
and more open.

919
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,290
But if you want to talk
more, we can find

920
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,660
you at Office Hours.

921
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,334
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

922
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:52,590
AUDIENCE: Hey.

923
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,460
Now with the version three of
that in-app billing, how soon

924
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,440
can we expect to be able
to do multiple

925
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,170
purchases of a single item?

926
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,000
For instance, purchase 200
tokens for $200, and have

927
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,720
Google Play handle the
maintenance of that?

928
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,100
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: So that's
versus configuring one SKU

929
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,610
that equals 200 tokens?

930
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,520
It's not on the immediate
roadmap, but it's something

931
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,160
we've talked about
in the past.

932
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,490
So I'll take that back to the
team, and see if we can

933
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,870
prioritize it.

934
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,620
And the use case, is it just
a maintenance issue, or--?

935
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,780
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, I can do
it right now, but I'll have

936
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,460
to build my own server
infrastructure to manage the

937
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,800
consumption of those
200 tokens.

938
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,980
So what I'd really like to do
is I'll allow the user to

939
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,110
purchase 200 tokens.

940
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,485
And then as they use them in
game, I just tell Google Play,

941
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:43,840
you know, consumer on token,
consumer on token.

942
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,125
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: OK.

943
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:44,410
Yeah.

944
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,770
That makes sense.

945
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

946
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,900
Do you have any tip
on what's better?

947
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,650
Do a [? light ?] in the
[? pro app ?], or do a

948
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,950
[? light ?] app with
an in-app purchase?

949
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,400
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI:
I'm sorry.

950
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,180
I didn't get that.

951
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,420
BOB MEESE: You're saying whether
you should do two

952
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,290
different applications, or
whether you do a free app with

953
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,000
in-app purchase?

954
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,990
One area we found is whenever
developers have two different

955
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,120
apps, it creates a
lot of overhead.

956
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,000
So some of the general guidance
is simplifying &mdash;

957
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,200
finding one application
to invest all

958
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,510
your resources behind.

959
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,790
Otherwise, it can lead
to confusion.

960
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,580
So the general best practice is
to invest in a single app,

961
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,570
especially for small
developers.

962
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,200
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: And the
upgrade experience is not as

963
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,690
nice, right?

964
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,940
Because you have to get them to
go install a different app

965
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,150
and buy another app,
versus just in-app

966
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,895
purchase and you upgrade.

967
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:35,040
You unlock new content
immediately in the app.

968
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,670
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

969
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,620
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: Sure.

970
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
wondering if you are

971
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,750
considering doing promo
codes for paid apps?

972
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:47,120
And are you also considering
affiliate programs?

973
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: Yeah, those
are things that we've

974
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,690
looked into, as well.

975
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,180
We've launched the promotional
campaigns in terms of promo

976
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,040
codes for money.

977
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,580
So you can actually get $50, as
I mentioned, in the earlier

978
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,510
Galaxy S III campaign.

979
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,310
Or we're looking as well into
being able to allow developers

980
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,660
to issue promo codes, and have
them redeemed by whatever it

981
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,360
is &mdash; the press, or reviewers,
on whoever it is.

982
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,770
Yes.

983
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,503
AUDIENCE: And what about
the affiliate programs?

984
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:15,240
Are you going to launch
that soon?

985
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,240
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: I don't
think it will launch soon.

986
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,050
But there's differently talk
about them, especially in the

987
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,290
content side of Google Play.

988
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,330
But I will definitely take
that back to the team.

989
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,110
AUDIENCE: All right Thanks.

990
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,870
AUDIENCE: How are you defining
what is a top app?

991
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:36,090
Is it the top sales that day,
that week, that month?

992
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,970
And are you also doing any
editorializing around that

993
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,870
where you're just putting
in things that you like?

994
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,460
BOB MEESE: No, no.

995
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,880
All of the top list are straight
algorithmic in there.

996
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,460
It's revenue transacted through
Google Play, and it's

997
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,830
generally over a week
time frame.

998
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,580
AUDIENCE: One week time frame?

999
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:50,830
BOB MEESE: Yeah.

1000
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,540
AUDIENCE: The same thing across
[? pre-paid ?] apps, or

1001
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,260
free apps, paid apps,
et cetera?

1002
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,560
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: There was
talk earlier about Discovery

1003
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,040
that Ankit Jain gave.

1004
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,330
It's one of those we've
highlighted.

1005
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,250
And that was actually
all about that &mdash;

1006
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,800
all about discovery,
and top lists, and

1007
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,050
those sorts of things.

1008
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,730

1009
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,070
AUDIENCE: You had an example
about the kind of creative

1010
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,100
that works well in the Play
Store, and what your listing

1011
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,780
should contain.

1012
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,560
Do you have similar recipes or
insights about how to do paid

1013
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,090
user acquisition, which you
also briefly mentioned?

1014
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,650
What works in paid
user acquisition?

1015
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,000
BOB MEESE: We observe it.

1016
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,920
We don't make recommendations.

1017
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,160
There's a part of Google's
business which is fully

1018
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,840
separate from us, with the
ads business, which

1019
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,080
focuses more on that.

1020
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,280
For us, the conversation today
was more around observing it

1021
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,640
more so than recommending.

1022
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
But there's plenty of other
smart people &mdash; either other

1023
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,610
developers that are out there
that are doing it, or the

1024
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,035
vendors themselves &mdash; who
I'm sure would be

1025
00:39:45,035 --> 00:39:47,710
happy to educate you.

1026
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,920
AUDIENCE: If I have a paid
application with low download

1027
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,940
numbers, one way I could boost
those is to offer it free for

1028
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,300
a period of time, say a week
or a month, or even a day?

1029
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,170
Is that still not possible,
and why?

1030
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,270
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI:
Converting a free

1031
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,023
app to a paid app?

1032
00:40:07,023 --> 00:40:08,010
AUDIENCE: Other way.

1033
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,620
I have a paid app now.

1034
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,370
I want to make it free
for a day or a week.

1035
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,670
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: And
then bring it back?

1036
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,630
We'll have to take that back to
the Developer Console team.

1037
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,730
That's more of a kind of, how
do we manage the SKUs, and

1038
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,190
what types of SKUs are out
there, like each product and

1039
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,180
catagorization.

1040
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,970
But I'll take that
back to the team.

1041
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,070
BOB MEESE: And I think
that's it.

1042
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,930
Our time is up.

1043
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,245

questions. please follow up

1045
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,690
IBRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI:
Yeah, office hours.

1047
