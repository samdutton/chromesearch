1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,600
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Hi.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,060
So I'm Alex Komoroske.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,630
MAX HEINRITZ: I'm
Max Heinritz.

5
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,440
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We're two
Product Managers on Chrome's

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,920
Open Web Platform team.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,360
Now most of this session is
going to be just questions and

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,630
answers from you guys.

9
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,980
You'll see there's that Google
Moderator link up there.

10
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,170
You can leave questions on
there, or you can ask them

11
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,222
live, whichever you prefer.

12
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:25,240
But that's what we'll spend
most of our time on.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,150
Before that, Max and I are going
to talk for a couple

14
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,640
minutes about Blink and the
progress we've made in the

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,110
past month.

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,420
So it's kind of crazy.

17
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,110
But it's only been a little
bit over a month since we

18
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,520
announced Blink.

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,830
And Blink, for those who don't
know, is a new rendering

20
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,900
engine originally based
on WebKit that

21
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,200
we're using in Chromium.

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,705
The mission statement of Blink
is to improve the open web

23
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:53,270
through technical innovation
and good citizenship.

24
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,960
So I'm going to talk about the
technical innovation par, and

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,190
Max will talk briefly about
the good citizenship part.

26
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,769
So when we made the decision
to create Blink, it was a

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,750
really hard one that we had
to come to terms with.

28
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,230
But it came down to,
fundamentally, that Chromium

29
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,550
used a different multiprocess
architecture from other

30
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,980
WebKit-based browsers.

31
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,220
And that increased complexity,
not just for the Chromium

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,500
team, but for everybody
who is using WebKit.

33
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,120
So we mentioned back when we
made the announcement that we

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,300
anticipated that we could remove
about 4.5 million lines

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,370
from the codebase.

36
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,840
And that was things like build
systems for other ports,

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,960
JavaScriptCore, because we use
V8, some of the WebKit2

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,750
porting layer, and a number
of other things.

39
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,520
But the progress we've
made since then has

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,870
really blowing our minds.

41
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,350
In fact, we've removed
now, I think, $8.8

42
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,180
million lines of code.

43
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,800
So that's just a really cool
stat, I think, that shows that

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,610
we've been able to streamline
this even

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,320
more than we expected.

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,515
That's 63% of the
repo, I think.

47
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:58,340
And it's also 191 megabytes
of code.

48
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,710
So less code is better for
developers, because it means

49
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,600
that people who are working on
Blink, they can check out the

50
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
codebase faster.

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,920
They can build faster.

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,120
And of course, less code is less
surface area for bugs.

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,220
And it hasn't just actually been
us that's been able to

54
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,340
clean up like this.

55
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,960
The WebKit project as well has
really been able to clean out

56
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,130
some stuff that was really
just there for Chromium.

57
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,640
So it's been really great
for both projects.

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,290
These are just really
easy stats to pull.

59
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,330
What actually really matters is
developer productivity and

60
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,060
how much stuff we can do to
improve the stability and

61
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,770
performance of Blink.

62
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,580
But what I'm most excited about,
actually, is not just

63
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,420
the performance or the
development and productivity

64
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,490
but some of the cool new
experiments that we've been

65
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,300
able to start that we couldn't
have done before.

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,305
So one of those is a project
called Oilpan.

67
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:51,460
And this is, just again, an
experiment into seeing if we

68
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,460
can move the DOM nodes into
a garbage collected heap.

69
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,895
So today, DOM nodes, they use
a reference counting system,

70
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:02,280
and it interacts in a very
complex way with the

71
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,530
JavaScript engine.

72
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,570
And so if this works, it could
really help make that much

73
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,770
simpler and much easier
to understand and less

74
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,030
error-prone.

75
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,650
Another cool one is called
Lazy Block Layout.

76
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,780
Again, a very early
experiment.

77
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,710
The idea is, what if we could
make very large but simple

78
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,750
layouts much, much
faster to do?

79
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,760
So if you're only using a
handful of features, why can't

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,990
we make that much,
much faster?

81
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,030
And if it works, this would
allow things like infinite

82
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,550
scrolling lists to be much
easier to accomplish on the

83
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,880
web platform.

84
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,400
So those are literally just two
totally random examples of

85
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,140
experiments that we've started
in the past month or so with

86
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,470
Blink that we're really
excited about.

87
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,690
There's a whole bunch
of other ones.

88
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,580
All of the stuff about these and
the other ones are on our

89
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,980
mailing list.

90
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,450
Cool.

91
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,010
MAX HEINRITZ: Thanks, Alex.

92
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,930
So Alex talked a lot about how
Blink enables technical

93
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,730
innovation.

94
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,610
But it's important to balance
that momentum with

95
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,680
interoperability.

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,200
We want the whole web to evolve,
not just Chrome.

97
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,680
That's where the second half
of our mission statement

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,300
comes, good citizenship.

99
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,670
I'm going to talk about a couple
of our initiatives in

100
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,330
this area and how they might
be relevant to you guys, as

101
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,610
web developers.

102
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,250
The first thing I want to point
out is that all of our

103
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,290
code is open source.

104
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,550
So you can go to our project
page, chromium.org/blink, to

105
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,329
download that.

106
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,794
I'll show a link at the end.

107
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:20,120
The next thing I want to talk
about is our transparent

108
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,220
Launch Review process.

109
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,630
Launch Review process is healthy
for projects in many

110
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,800
different ways.

111
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,090
For us, it's important for
external contributors to

112
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,310
understand how they can work
with our team to lend their

113
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,740
code in the codebase.

114
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,560
It's also important to build
consensus early on in the

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,400
development process and
avoid conflicts later.

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,430
And finally &mdash; and this one is
really important for us &mdash;

117
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,430
we don't want to ship
proprietary features, and the

118
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,390
launch process helps
avoid doing that.

119
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,250
Basically, when we ship
something in Chrome on the web

120
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,346
platform, we want all browsers
to ship it, not just Chrome.

121
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:51,500
So the way this works in
practice is say you're a Blink

122
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,210
engineer and you want to a web
platform feature or somehow

123
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,450
change the behavior we expose
to web developers.

124
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,800
Before you start writing code,
we ask you to first send an

125
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,270
intent to implement email
to our public

126
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,540
mailing list, blink-dev.

127
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,240
This email follows a
template format.

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,630
We ask you to provide a link
to the specification, a

129
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,510
description of use cases and
motivation, and finally give

130
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,370
an overview of compatibility
risk.

131
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,600
And in that last section, what
we're looking for is, do other

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,080
browser vendors think this
feature is a good idea?

133
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,340
Is it making progress through
the standardization process?

134
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,990
And usually, there's some
discussion that follows about

135
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,500
whether this is something that
belongs in Blink or not.

136
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,430
Later, when the feature's ready
to ship, we ask them to

137
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,100
send another email, an intent
to ship email, which is

138
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,340
scrutinized a little
bit more carefully.

139
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,285
It's only been about a month or
so, but this launch process

140
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:36,360
seems to be working
pretty well.

141
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,570
We've had 40 of these
"Intent" threads.

142
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,630
And of those, we're proud to
say that a third have come

143
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,820
from non-Googlers.

144
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,360
We've had "Intent" threads come
from people like Intel,

145
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,480
Adobe, Opera, and, earlier
this week, Microsoft.

146
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,940
So pretty exciting stuff.

147
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,920
One thing I want to point out
before I move on is that this

148
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,060
process isn't designed to
prevent us from shipping

149
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,770
things only in Chrome.

150
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,690
It's designed to force us to
be very deliberate and

151
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,990
thoughtful if we ever
decide to do that.

152
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,480
So that's just something
to keep in mind.

153
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,320
Another thing I want to point
out is that everything I just

154
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,580
talked about is public.

155
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,010
You can participate and follow
along in our public mailing

156
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,690
list, blink-dev@chromium.org.

157
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,820
But at the same time, I
understand that not everyone

158
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,720
has the time to follow all of
the intricacies of browser

159
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,620
development.

160
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,180
And so there are a couple other
ways that you can stay

161
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,230
up to date on what we're working
on that don't involve

162
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,550
so much traffic.

163
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,150
So I'll talk about them and
order them on this slide from

164
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,990
most traffic at the top, which
is blink-dev, to the ones with

165
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,670
less noise at the bottom.

166
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,505
So in addition to blink-dev,
we have a cool site called

167
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:39,020
chromestatus.com, which I'll
show you guys now.

168
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,990

169
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,350
Ooh, the resolution isn't
very good right now.

170
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,500
Basically, this is a spreadsheet
where each row

171
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,000
corresponds to a feature that
we're currently working on or

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,340
recently shipped.

173
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,890
There's some logistical
information, like the

174
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,220
feature's name, who the owner
is, the bugs, its

175
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,640
implementation status
in Chromium.

176
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,020
And then over here, the
cells are colored.

177
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,040
And these columns correspond
to things that we think

178
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,830
reflect web citizenship, so for
example, progress through

179
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,140
standardization, the views of
other browser vendors, the

180
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,550
excitement from web
developers.

181
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,430
And our goal with this is
to have a nice visual

182
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,510
representation of how each
feature reflects our web

183
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,610
citizenship.

184
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,770
And then, as you scroll down,
you can kind of see the

185
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,110
project's overall citizenship,
just based on these colors.

186
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,370
So right now this is just an
iframed Google spreadsheet,

187
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,140
but we're hoping to make
progress here.

188
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,740
I'll point out how you can
actually subscribe to get

189
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,150
email notifications when
there's changes made.

190
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,180
Just go in here and enable
Notification Rules, and you

191
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,030
can get emails to
stay up to date.

192
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,240
I also want to point out that
we've gotten great community

193
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,370
help with this spreadsheet.

194
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,550
Is Masataka here from Japan?

195
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,780
Yeah.

196
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,580
Masataka has been an
enormous help.

197
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,110
And we actually haven't met in
person yet, so it would be

198
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,660
great if you could come
up after the talk.

199
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,510
But yeah.

200
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,230
It's really awesome to see
people coming together to help

201
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,710
build this set of information.

202
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,950
OK.

203
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,360
Back to the slides.

204
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,890
So those are two ways you can
stay up to date on features.

205
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,520
A third way is through our
Developer Relations team.

206
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,510
They have Google+ and Twitter
channels that you can follow.

207
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,250
And then finally, every time we
launch a new Chrome beta,

208
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,705
we publish a Chromium blog post
which describes all of

209
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:15,120
the web platform changes, and
that includes things like

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,660
deprecations, which might
be relevant to you guys.

211
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,410
So these are a couple ways that
you can stay up to date

212
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,400
on what's going on in Blink.

213
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,660
Again, you can get
this information

214
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,406
on our project page.

215
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:27,060
So the last thing I want to talk
about before we turn it

216
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,640
over to Q&A is web platform
feature adoption.

217
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,429
Google's in a pretty unique
place, in terms of

218
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,320
understanding how people
are using the web.

219
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,940
We want to make this information
available to other

220
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,020
people who might be
interested in it.

221
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,840
So what you're looking
at here is data from

222
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,820
Google Search Index.

223
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,920
Basically, what we did is we
ran a graph over all of the

224
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,180
pages that we have and
tried to look for new

225
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,690
HTML5 element tags.

226
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,050
And so this top line, for
example, is header.

227
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,970
And you can see that usage has
increased from something like

228
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,950
7% of web pages a couple months
ago to near 9% now.

229
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,030
So this graph is just kind
of useful information.

230
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,200
But we're trying to get the
similar data for CSS and for

231
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,840
JavaScript APIs.

232
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,070
And this could be useful in a
couple ways that I'll just

233
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,210
list out now.

234
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,650
One is say you're a browser
engineer, and you're trying to

235
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,146
optimize CSS.

236
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,530
It would be pretty useful to
have a list of all of the CSS

237
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,790
properties and their frequency
across the web so that you can

238
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,860
know which code pass would be
most efficient to optimize.

239
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,920
Another example is, say you're
a specification editor, and

240
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,460
you want to know if you can make
breaking changes to the

241
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,180
spec without breaking the web.

242
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,180
This would help you feel
comfortable doing that.

243
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,970
For web developers, it's just
interesting to see what's

244
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,430
reaching the mainstream
and what they can

245
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,210
use in their websites.

246
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,300
And finally, this is important
for us as the Blink team, is

247
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,500
that we can get information
on when we can responsibly

248
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,930
deprecate features.

249
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,800
And so a good example of this
is with prefixed versus

250
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,630
unprefixed features.

251
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,140
Oftentimes, when we release
an unprefixed version of a

252
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,170
feature, we can't remove support
for the prefixed

253
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,480
version because the
web would break.

254
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,270
And so we're stuck with this old
code path for the prefixed

255
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,820
version when we really don't
need it any more, because we

256
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,110
have the unprefixed version.

257
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,910
And so we can use this system to
track not only adoption of

258
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,390
new features, but also decline
of old features and knowing we

259
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,290
can feel comfortable
removing them.

260
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,510
So this is the project page
I was referencing,

261
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,770
chromium.org/blink.

262
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,060
Go there.

263
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,640
There's a bunch of
information.

264
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,630
And then, just to summarize real
quick, Alex talked a lot

265
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,000
about how Blink enables
technical

266
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,460
innovation on the web.

267
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,870
And I talked about how it's
important to stay good

268
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,700
citizens and make sure that
innovation goes both ways,

269
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,330
both from the community
to Blink and from

270
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,730
Blink to the community.

271
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,920
So now we have time for some
Q&A. And I'm going to invite

272
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,886
some people from the team up.

273
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:42,190
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So Darin,
Eric, and Paul, you

274
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,440
want to come up?

275
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,722

276
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:48,160
MAX HEINRITZ: Yeah.

277
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,190
So we have a Google Moderator.

278
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,340
And we're taking questions
from the audience, too.

279
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,310
So do you guys want
to introduce

280
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,970
yourselves real quick?

281
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,220
DARIN FISHER: Sure.

282
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,550

283
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,480
PAUL IRISH: My name
is Paul Irish.

284
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm a Developer Advocate
for Chrome.

285
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,370
My name's Eric Seidel.

286
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,760
I work on Blink.

287
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,240
DARIN FISHER: Hi.

288
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,330
My name's Darin Fisher.

289
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,870
I'm an engineering
lead on Chrome.

290
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,480

291
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,940
MAX HEINRITZ: OK.

292
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,370
So you guys are welcome to come
up to the microphones if

293
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,080
you have any questions.

294
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,700
Otherwise, we'll just run
through the Dory.

295
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:26,970
OK.

296
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,430
I'll start with an audience
question.

297
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,090
AUDIENCE: One thing I want to
know, please, when Blink is

298
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,160
coming to Android WebView.

299
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,550
Right now WebView classic is
there, and there's support

300
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,620
for, if you install
Chrome, then the

301
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,760
view defaults to Chrome.

302
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,690
But when will Blink
will become a

303
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,920
default WebView on Android?

304
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,630
DARIN FISHER: So actually, if
you follow the chromium.org

305
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,840
project, you can see that
there's an Android WebView

306
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,530
project being built there.

307
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,610
You can actually check out the
code and try it yourself.

308
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,260
What I can say is that it's
under development.

309
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,030
We're very interested, of
course, in bringing the best

310
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,350
of the Chromium engine, Blink
included, to Android.

311
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,280
And that includes not only
Chrome on Android but also the

312
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,530
WebView implementation.

313
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,300

314
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,270
AUDIENCE: Right now the Coda,
which is in Android underscore

315
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:25,600
WebView, there's a TestShell
there, which you can build.

316
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,080
I guess it doesn't work.

317
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,340
Or at least it's kind of
partly implemented.

318
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,590
Right?

319
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,270

320
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,330
ERIC SEIDEL: So in terms of
developing Blink on Android,

321
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,650
generally we actually
use Content Shell.

322
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,560
That's sort of a new way.

323
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,010
TestShell was the old way.

324
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,440
And you're right.

325
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,390
Both of them are under a lot
of flux right now after the

326
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,480
Blink transition.

327
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,270
And I think you'll see
those stabilize

328
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,030
in the coming months.

329
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,813
AUDIENCE: OK.

330
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,063
Cool.

331
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,270

332
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,660
My question is about
vendor prefixes.

334
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,750
So Blink won't be having them,
and instead opting for kind of

335
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,090
like a dev gate for experimental
features.

336
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,840
Now some prefixed CSS properties
are older than

337
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,800
Chrome itself and are still
prefixed in Chrome.

338
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,780
However, I've been deploying
them in apps

339
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,770
for many years now.

340
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,850
So my worry with this new policy
is that the only saving

341
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,920
grace of vendor prefixes will
be lost, that I won't get to

342
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,720
push new web platform features
to users in a

343
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,960
near-term time frame.

344
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,660
So my question is, how
aggressively is the Chrome

345
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,420
team going to be locking away
these experimental features

346
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,170
behind this dev wall?

347
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,200
ERIC SEIDEL: So I'll take the
first part of that question.

348
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,710
To start with, vendor prefixes,
as probably most of

349
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,620
you know, are when it
says WebKit-fu as a

350
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,210
property or as a value.

351
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,390
And we in Blink are trying
to avoid that.

352
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,635
We don't want to introduce
yet another Blink-fu.

353
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:10,500

354
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,220
Vendor prefixes are just like
any other API that we've

355
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,400
shipped, and we don't
want to break.

356
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,600
So we have been measuring, like
max has said, to make

357
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,180
sure that we don't break
your website as we

358
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,290
work to remove these.

359
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,840
And most of that policy is about
forward looking, that we

360
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,530
don't want to add new ones.

361
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,685
And we'll be trying to remove
the existing ones as we find

362
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:36,280
that we can, as their
usage falls off.

363
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,640
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So I think a
second part of your question

364
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,840
as well is this concern that the
prefixing system used to

365
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,260
allow new emerging web standards
or features to be

366
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,450
deployed before they were
fully standardized.

367
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,540
And that allows you to play with
all these great goodies.

368
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,530
The problem is that prefixing
was supposed to be a warning

369
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,450
to developers of don't
rely on this.

370
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,470
It might go away at any time.

371
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,920
But it's just like any other
API, where people start using

372
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,500
it, and then if you turn
it off, the web breaks.

373
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,160
And so with this process, it's
definitely something where we

374
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,440
have to push a little bit harder
and talk with people

375
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,890
like Mozilla, for example, the
guy behind you in line there,

376
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,400
to talk about features.

377
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,730
And we think this is
a great feature.

378
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,060
What are your plans?

379
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,670
If Mozilla says, yeah, we
love this too, awesome.

380
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,860
If there's a spec, awesome.

381
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,125
But it definitely will require
us to push a little bit harder

382
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,370
to make sure that other browser
vendors are interested

383
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,550
in the same things that we're
interested in turning on.

384
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,710
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
the pace of progress might

385
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,242
slow down, as a result?

386
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:37,150
DARIN FISHER: I think that's
a great question.

387
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,610
I think that we're very
fortunate that we are not

388
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,890
alone in having a six-week
release cycle.

389
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,045
If you look at Mozilla, they
also have an accelerated

390
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,330
release cycle, and they also
have a desire not to ship

391
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,325
vendor prefix features.

392
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:54,790
And since they also have a
desire to improve the web

393
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,930
platform, it seems like
we have this wonderful

394
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,110
opportunity to capitalize on
this shared ambition to

395
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,910
improve the platform and not
just litter it with a bunch of

396
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,930
Moz dash and WebKit dash or
Blink dash, to actually do the

397
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,700
right thing and move quickly.

398
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,410
And so, actually, in many ways I
feel like we can actually do

399
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,480
a better job than we
could in the past.

400
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,360
Because in the past,
what did we do?

401
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,490
We added something, and then
when another vendor came

402
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,210
along, they want to do it
a little differently.

403
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,390
And then we had another
way to do it.

404
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,710
And you end up with multiple
different ways of doing the

405
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,270
same thing.

406
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,790
For example, we had three
different ways in CSS of

407
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,220
expressing gradient.

408
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,500
That's not fun.

409
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,100
And so, it seems really
promising now that, like I

410
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,467
said, with Mozilla on the
six-week release cycle and

411
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:42,580
Chrome on a six-week release
cycle that we could be able to

412
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,700
do the right thing
and quicker.

413
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,190
PAUL IRISH: I guess I'll also
add that browser vendors and

414
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,340
sanders groups have felt a
greater urgency to get things

415
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,305
done and get it shipped and
available to users recently.

416
00:16:59,305 --> 00:17:02,490
The CSS working group, in
particular, has identified

417
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,940
that getting things to Candidate
Rec, which is the

418
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,760
point at which, basically, there
is multi-vendor interest

419
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,170
in implementations out there,
that that is a key target to

420
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,950
get done within a year.

421
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,579
And so, sanders groups really
want to make sure that things

422
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,030
are accelerated and still
everyone had a chance and

423
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,979
developers have a chance
to get feedback.

424
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:30,360
At the same time, browser
vendors don't want a bunch of

425
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,950
features to be locked behind
this one flag for years.

426
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,970
We want to make sure that
they ship out too.

427
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,690
Now I think this model's really
good, because we're not

428
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,490
able to ship a feature that just
kind of sits out there in

429
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,415
prefix land forever.

430
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:45,430
It's not shipped.

431
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,680
And so we want it to get out
there, and we're going to do

432
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,080
the legwork to make sure that it
reaches the standardization

433
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,730
goals so that it can actually
get to users.

434
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,450
But I expect that you're going
to see things quick.

435
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,830
You're going to have it
available for your users as

436
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,310
soon as we can make it happen.

437
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,310
AUDIENCE: That all
sounds fantastic.

438
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,750
Thanks a lot, guys.

439
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,856
MAX HEINRITZ: Let's do one
question from the Dory.

440
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:09,280
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's
all right.

441
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,540
MAX HEINRITZ: Go ahead.

442
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,520
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to know
what the expected user

443
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,840
flow was for enabling
these features.

444
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,690
Is there a way that we can kind
of prompt users and say,

445
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,400
hey, I'm going to use this
special feature, say, on a

446
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,130
Chrome experiment site and
I get a little bit easier

447
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,630
interaction, so they don't have
to go to Chrome Flags and

448
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,050
enable it deeper?

449
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,480
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So that's
actually intentional.

450
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,780
AUDIENCE: I know.

451
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,510
ALEX KOMOROSKE: About flags
is a little bit

452
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,270
scary for our end users.

453
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,180
And we know that.

454
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,605
And that's one of the reasons
that's the place you

455
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:34,350
go in to flip it.

456
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,660
Otherwise, you convince all
your users, all the users

457
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,020
everywhere, to flip their
experimental flags on, and now

458
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,280
that's de facto.

459
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,730
And so we are definitely trying
to figure out how to

460
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,920
balance this.

461
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,900
So you want people to be able
to use the features, to use

462
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,230
them in real life websites
and give feedback to

463
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,600
standardization to other
browser vendors.

464
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,660
But you also don't want to
get them stuck with a bad

465
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,690
implementation that
you can't change.

466
00:18:59,690 --> 00:18:59,930
AUDIENCE: No.

467
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,190
I definitely understand that.

468
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,870
With prefixes, it was a
transparent process.

469
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,340
With the notification, then
it's a user op-in.

470
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,950
And major websites aren't
going to ask the user to

471
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,790
enable 100 different
experimental things.

472
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,840
But I'm afraid that it might
change the way that

473
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,580
experimentations with the new
features are exposed.

474
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,630
If it's only developers that are
going in an changing those

475
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,080
flags, then you're not going
to get as much community

476
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,330
interest from the
non-developers.

477
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,640

478
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,240
DARIN FISHER: Here's one
way to look at it.

479
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,000
Before Blink, it was a little
bit more difficult for us to

480
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,090
experiment with web
platform features.

481
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,250
And now we have the ability to
more easily put things in

482
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,100
behind a flag.

483
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,380
And that allows us to not only
get an implementation

484
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,040
experience, but it also
allows web developers

485
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,610
to try it more easily.

486
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,570
Previously, if we wanted to do
that kind of thing, often it

487
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,790
meant doing a branch of Chromium
and then trying to

488
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,660
get somebody to download
that custom build.

489
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,450
It was a lot harder to get the
feedback that we need from web

490
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,400
developers.

491
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,630
So really, hopefully this
accelerates the feedback

492
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,505
process and improves &mdash;

493
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:07,190
That's a big part of the
standardization process is

494
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,920
getting web developers to chime
in and give their input.

495
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,290
And being able to actually try
out an implementation is key

496
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,780
to that, but also to be able
to try without making that

497
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,320
long-term commitment that
we do have when

498
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,550
we release a feature.

499
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,630
And as, I think, others on the
panel have said, when we ship

500
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,080
something with a vendor prefix,
it was just as much of

501
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,560
a commitment to the web
community as an API that was

502
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:30,985
unprefixed.

503
00:20:30,985 --> 00:20:33,590
It doesn't really matter
that it's in

504
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,610
some standard somewhere.

505
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,340
If we put it there and people
start depending on it, we're

506
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,330
stuck with it.

507
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,620
It's part of the platform,
like it or not.

508
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,990
And so we just wanted to sort of
turn that around and focus

509
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,000
on trying to do the right
thing and not creating

510
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,120
more of this mess.

511
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

512
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,516
Flexbox is a pretty good
example of that.

513
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,280

514
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,530
MAX HEINRITZ: OK.

515
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,440
Let's do one question from the
Moderator, and then we'll take

516
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,240
another audience question.

517
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,190
So the question is, "Chrome on
Windows has had issues with

518
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,410
webfont rendering for a
long time now, even

519
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,670
with Google Web Fonts.

520
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,220
Is solving these issues
a priority on Blink?".

521
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,650
DARIN FISHER: Absolutely.

522
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,410
This was specifically asking
about fonts on Windows?

523
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,500
Yeah.

524
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,190
Actually, we have work underway
to add support for

525
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,980
subpixel positioning of
fonts on Windows.

526
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,440
We have that enabled
on other platforms.

527
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,350
The challenge on Windows is just
that the GDI, the font

528
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,890
rendering system that
we have been using,

529
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,940
doesn't support it.

530
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,700
And we're working to move
to DirectWrite.

531
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,620
The challenge with DirectWrite
is our sandbox architecture

532
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,100
kind of works against the
way DirectWrite works.

533
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,720
However, there is a solution
to that, and it's in

534
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,390
development now.

535
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,770
And so it should be available
behind a flag shortly, if not

536
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,724
in a canary shortly after.

537
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:52,710
MAX HEINRITZ: Cool.

538
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,530
Audience question.

539
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,080
Let's go here.

540
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

541
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,570
In building on what you talked
about, about getting the new

542
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,815
APIs out quicker in a year, I'm
obviously familiar with

543
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:05,940
that and have worked with you
guys on several things.

544
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,890
In the future, a few years now,
lots more APIs will be in

545
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,130
the web platform.

546
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,490
And Paul, you talked
about it as the

547
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,080
platform and "The Platform".

548
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,900
I guess my question is, with
Boot to Gecko, we want to

549
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,920
start a conversation, and a
conversation with everyone.

550
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,300
And have you guys felt
internally those urges of,

551
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,350
hey, what about when we land
these powerful features that

552
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,470
give us parity with things
people are able to do on apps

553
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,200
on the phone and stuff
like that and

554
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,480
these native languages?

555
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,990
Have you talked about what
comes next outside of the

556
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,510
browser or the web being a
foundation for a device like a

557
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,880
phone or anything like that?

558
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,550

559
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,770
DARIN FISHER: It sounds like, as
you probably know, we have

560
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,700
the Chrome packaged
app system.

561
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,770
And there's a lot of overlap
there with Boot to Gecki.

562
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,760
I don't know if you were here
for the previous talk.

563
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,540
Eric answered a similar question
about Sys Apps

564
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,740
Working Group and
standardization of these sort

565
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:09,070
of web platform extensions that
are designed to allow you

566
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,330
to build apps that live in
that native apps style

567
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,100
sandbox, as opposed to drive
by web style sandbox.

568
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,040
And I think it's absolutely a
really rich area to explore

569
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,260
collaboration and finding ways
to standardize and agree on

570
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,790
what these APIs look like.

571
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,900
It's sort of the early days for
some of these platforms.

572
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,250
And I know that our team has
been talking with folks at

573
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:39,680
Mozilla and trying to find
commonalities, trying to learn

574
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,270
more about how each other's
thinking about it.

575
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

576
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,280
I just had to ask after seeing
the giant Chrome Android.

577
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,510
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We think
the web is pretty cool.

578
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,730
If that wasn't clear.

579
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,300
MAX HEINRITZ: Let's do a live
question over here.

580
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,350
AUDIENCE: Hey.

581
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,940
I'm a bit curious about
resources on the Blink team.

582
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,990
So now that you started out up
at the Blink project, the

583
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,470
upper guys have joined too, what
does this mean in terms

584
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,850
of resources on the team?

585
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,770
Are you scaling up the team
internally to invest more

586
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,390
resources into Blink and the
rendering engine, or are you

587
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,200
going to continue at
the same pace?

588
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,530
What does it mean that Opera
has joined the project?

589
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,570
ERIC SEIDEL: So I think the
bigger wins have come less

590
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,260
from us hiring more people &mdash;
because, as far as I know, I

591
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,760
haven't seen a lot of new
people being hired &mdash;

592
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,220
and more just there's a certain
budget of complexity

593
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,530
for our project.

594
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,060
There's only so many
things you can do.

595
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,610
And when we were in WebKit, we
had to do 101 things that we

596
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,150
just didn't need to do.

597
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,060
And now we just got rid of those
101 things, and so now

598
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,390
we can take that same complexity
budget and spend it

599
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,610
on much more interesting
features for you guys, on

600
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,470
getting features to you faster,
on doing interesting

601
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,780
things like runtime flags.

602
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,710
And so I don't see our team size
changing very quickly.

603
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,850
These guys would know better
than I. But we suddenly have a

604
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,080
whole lot more mind share
to spread around.

605
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,760
DARIN FISHER: I would just add
that we love to grow the team

606
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,360
with talented engineers who are
interested in improving

607
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,610
the web platform.

608
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,206

609
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:18,456
MAX HEINRITZ: OK.

610
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:20,480

611
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,790
Another live question.

612
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,320
AUDIENCE: So my question
involves the

613
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,340
divergence from WebKit.

614
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,860
Right now, when we're building
websites, you

615
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,620
check it against IE.

616
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,820
You check it against
a WebKit browser.

617
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,900
You should test events against
both Chrome and Safari.

618
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,150
But for the most part, WebKit
is WebKit, and all WebKit

619
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,380
browsers render things pretty
much the same way.

620
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,250
Moving forward, as Chrome and
Blink adds features, like the

621
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:56,850
Web MIDI API that WebKit is
opposed to, I don't want to

622
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:10,540
say fragmentation, but how can
we move forward from this

623
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,300
world we're in now, where we
have to check against all

624
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,920
these different rendering
engines, if we keep adding

625
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,200
features to some rendering
engines that other ones just

626
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,190
do not want to do at all?

627
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,230
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So to be clear
on that specific example, Max

628
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,120
was talking earlier about our
intent to implement versus

629
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,390
intent to ship.

630
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,360
So it's very different.

631
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,640
So the intent to ship is, yes,
we are ready to commit to this

632
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,130
forever, basically.

633
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,710
Intent to implement is, yeah, we
think this is interesting.

634
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,900
We think that this could
be something we

635
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,440
would want to ship.

636
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,010
It's worthwhile to get the
experience of implementing it,

637
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,280
getting it in the hands of
developers behind a flag and

638
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,050
playing around with it.

639
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,420
So Web MIDI has had its intent
to implement on blink-dev.

640
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,310
And it looks interesting.

641
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,740
We're a little bit concerned
about some of the issues that

642
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,860
you just talked about.

643
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,330
And before we'd ever ship it,
by default we'd have to very

644
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,250
carefully weigh those
kinds of things.

645
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,240
So throughout all of this,
we want to minimize that

646
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,560
compatibility risk.

647
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,210
Because every time that there's
a feature that you

648
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,060
could target in one browser
that you can't target in

649
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,740
others, that hurts compatibility
a little bit.

650
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,820
And so we're very aware of that,
and we think about it

651
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,350
basically throughout all
these decisions.

652
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,270
It's one of the primary
things in our heads.

653
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,640
One other area that we can help
address this, by the way,

654
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,620
is testing.

655
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,050
So to some extent, one of the
reasons that you have to do a

656
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,890
lot of testing is because
browsers implement different

657
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,610
standards slightly differently,
or maybe the

658
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,390
standard wasn't clear
on something or was

659
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,280
ambiguous in some area.

660
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,610
But actually, having better
testing can help the different

661
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,700
browser vendors just make
sure they work the same.

662
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,260
And if you find something
where they both work

663
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,960
differently but they both are
within the terms of the spec,

664
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,980
well, the spec has a bug.

665
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,520
Fix that bug in the spec, and
figure out what the right

666
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,630
behavior is.

667
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,150
And so we're looking into
working with a bunch of other

668
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,355
folks to improve coverage of
testing that many of the

669
00:27:55,355 --> 00:27:56,680
different browser
vendors can run.

670
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,690
I think that's a really great
long-term solution to this

671
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,820
kind of problem.

672
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,490
PAUL IRISH: And I guess the
other part of this is to your

673
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,310
question where there's
not the same feature

674
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,730
parity across browsers.

675
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,380
This has kind of been the
case for a while.

676
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,620
And even if we do have all
browsers shipping the same

677
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,070
features, there's going
to be a different

678
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,760
release schedule at least.

679
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,290
So I think feature detection
is the right

680
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,550
way to handle this.

681
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,710
There's going to be an uneven
surface if you're developing

682
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,510
against edge of the web where
there are features present in

683
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,420
some cases and not
in other places.

684
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,250
In some cases, the experience
can degrade.

685
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,420
You don't need that feature
to deliver the experience.

686
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,200
And that's awesome when
you could do that.

687
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,920
In other cases, you can
find a polyfill.

688
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,880
You can find some other
way to handle it.

689
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,065
But I guess that's kind of the
way to deal with that.

690
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:48,540
DARIN FISHER: Yeah.

691
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,790
I was just going to add that
when we forked WebKit to

692
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,990
create the Blink Project, when
it comes to new features like,

693
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,720
say, something like Web MIDI,
it's not that if we had stayed

694
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,610
on WebKit there was any
promise that Apple was

695
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,300
actually going to
ship Web MIDI.

696
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,460
We had developed many features
for WebKit that

697
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,000
Apple had yet to ship.

698
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,710
And so really we sort of feel
like the better path is, if we

699
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,290
care about a feature, we want
to get it out there and get

700
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,200
developers using it.

701
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,280
And it's really through that
excitement and energy around

702
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,350
the feature and the cool things
that people build with

703
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,650
it, that's what will convince
the other browsers to come

704
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,990
along, if they're not
already convinced.

705
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,000
So there's always this sort of
tug and pull and push and pull

706
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,480
kind of a dynamic.

707
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,880
At any rate, Blink is largely
about allowing us to more

708
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,420
efficiently move the web
platform forward.

709
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,280
AUDIENCE: All right.

710
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,200
Thank you very much.

711
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,470
MAX HEINRITZ: Cool.

712
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,640
Thanks for the question.

713
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:44,920
OK.

714
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,280
Let's do one question
from the Moderator.

715
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,870
"What change, feature, or
improvement are you personally

716
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,170
was excited about the
possibility of implementing in

717
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:58,850
Blink?"

718
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,570
PAUL IRISH: One of the ones
that I'm psyched about &mdash;

719
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,250
I think, Eric, you might have
mentioned this one.

720
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,510
I don't think it's under
development.

721
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,430
You can tell me &mdash;

722
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,980
multi-threaded style
recalc and layout.

723
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,390
It's going to be awesome.

724
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,730
I'll tell you a little
bit of background.

725
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,410
So a lot of times you'll open
up the Chrome Dev Tools,

726
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,110
you'll do a Timeline, and you'll
be identifying what

727
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,930
your bottleneck is.

728
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,380
And in a lot of cases, there's a
lot of time spent in layout,

729
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,350
sometimes in style recalc,
depending on how much heavy

730
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,380
DOM manipulation you're doing.

731
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,540
And pretty much it's
single-threaded, going from

732
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,860
style recalc out from seeing
something on the screen.

733
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,180
And it can slow down your app.

734
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,790
So being able to basically take
some of these operations

735
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,370
and throw them to a separate
thread or a separate core, I'm

736
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,283
totally jazzed about
those experiments.

737
00:30:47,283 --> 00:30:50,130

738
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,380
ERIC SEIDEL: He stole
my answer.

739
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,140

740
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,200
But I'm actually also really
excited about the Oilpan stuff

741
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,520
that you saw mentioned.

742
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,360
And that's not something I'm
personally working on.

743
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,960
I'm working more on the
rendering side of things,

744
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,040
making things really fast
for your website.

745
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,510
But Oilpan gives all sorts
of potential performance

746
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,100
benefits, all sorts of potential
memory benefits,

747
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,650
potential security benefits.

748
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,860
And it's kind of way out
there, from a feature.

749
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,030
But us being our own entity,
having our own experimental

750
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,610
branches, being able to do sort
of thing iteratively and

751
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,922
quickly is really
exciting to me.

752
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:28,830
DARIN FISHER: Yeah.

753
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,920
I totally agree.

754
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,730
I love both of those
experiments.

755
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,570
And I was just a little bit
surprised that you didn't

756
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,690
mention out a process iframes
on the slide, Alex.

757
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,710
That, to me, is one
of my most &mdash;

758
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,340
One of the dreams I've always
had for Chrome's multiprocess

759
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,880
architecture that it could not
just sandbox tabs but actually

760
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,680
sandbox origins.

761
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,190
And to me, it's just
really exciting.

762
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,500
So the idea of turning Blink
into more of a frame server,

763
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,720
if you will, like in the iframe
sense, and allowing us

764
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,800
to isolate origins to their own
processes, I think it's

765
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,510
just going to be fabulous,
especially in this Cloud

766
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,030
world, this world where most of
your data's in the Cloud.

767
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,120
The sandbox that we have in
Chrome is fabulous at allowing

768
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,430
users to be protected against
malicious web content that

769
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,120
might try to exploit
a bug to persist

770
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
malware on your computer.

771
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,030
It's great at that, protecting
against that.

772
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,630
But a lot of the viable data
that users have is right there

773
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,230
in the Cloud.

774
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:33,000
And our sandbox doesn't
do anything to help

775
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,590
protect that data.

776
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,817
But if we were able to isolate
origins into our own

777
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:39,610
processes, then, man, that would
be a huge step forward

778
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,860
for web security.

779
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,310

780
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,901
PAUL IRISH: I'm going
to do another one.

781
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:46,743
ALEX KOMOROSKE: You
can have mine.

782
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:48,010
PAUL IRISH: All right.

783
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,930
Lazy Block Layouts.

784
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,000
So it came up on the slide.

785
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,840
But I think so far we haven't
had a great explanation.

786
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,700
So stop me if I screw this up.

787
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,500
But let's say you have
a list view.

788
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,860
You have this view, especially
on mobile device.

789
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,750
You'll have a bunch of items.

790
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,670
And what you want your user to
do is be able to basically

791
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:10,820
fling it with their thumb and
it still respond great.

792
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,390
It's challenging.

793
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,830
There's been all these hacks to
make this work fantastic on

794
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,170
the web platform.

795
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,730
And Lazy Block Layout is
targeting this use case of I

796
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,190
got a lot items, I want to
fling it and it to be

797
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,520
responsive and awesome.

798
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,130
You can read about the proposal
on blink-dev, but

799
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,790
it's targeting something that
developers are dealing with a

800
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:36,358
lot and something baking into a
platform solution for that.

801
00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:37,700
MAX HEINRITZ: Do you
have something?

802
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,210
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I'll just to
say, it's not particular to

803
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,900
Blink, I guess &mdash; oh, yeah &mdash;

804
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,140
is just web components.

805
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,150
If you've seen in past years,
I'm talking about

806
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,100
those again, again.

807
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,250
And we're going to have another
session tomorrow to

808
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,880
talk about it.

809
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,510
But I think web components is
an amazing set of emerging

810
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,300
standards that are really going
to change how people

811
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,960
write web apps.

812
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,580
MAX HEINRITZ: Another thing
we're working on is web

813
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,270
animations.

814
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,580
And this is a unified animation
model for the web.

815
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,760
And it's unclear how the WebKit
community would have

816
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,500
responded to this.

817
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,550
But it's something that Blink
gives us the ability to do on

818
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,290
our own, because we think
it's a good idea.

819
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,120
And so this will make animations
much faster.

820
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,610
And the cool stuff you saw with
Maps and Google+, users

821
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,590
are really looking for a rich
interactive experience.

822
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,760
And we need to provide that
in a performant way.

823
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,730
And web animations will
make that possible.

824
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,489
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's, again,
another emerging spec that's

825
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:22,850
being worked on with
folks from Adobe

826
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,842
and Mozilla and others.

827
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,654
MAX HEINRITZ: Right.

828
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:26,110
OK.

829
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,429
Anything else?

830
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,120
Cool.

831
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,929
Let's do a live question.

832
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,414
AUDIENCE: So on deprecating
features, you guys use a

833
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:38,825
counter to measure
stats on the web.

834
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:42,280
And I'm wondering what
the usage stats

835
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,780
of the WebView apps.

836
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,150
Because the code used for
WebView apps tends to more

837
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:58,130
depend on WebKit prefix or an

838
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:02,810
Apple-specific properties methods.

839
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:07,620
So the usage stats tend
to be different from

840
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,110
the ones on the web.

841
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:15,540
Do you guys plan for
introducing a

842
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,480
use counter for WebView?

843
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,910
ALEX KOMOROSKE: One thing I
want to point out too is

844
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,410
there's lots of different
methods of trying

845
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,310
to figure this out.

846
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,050
And not one of them
is perfect.

847
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,470
And so the hope is that by doing
multiple methods you can

848
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,430
get something that an aggregate
is pretty good.

849
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,840
So if you're looking just at
something in the web index,

850
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,920
you're only going to see that
it was passed down from the

851
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,150
server originally.

852
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,870
And if you are running either
lots of other approaches and

853
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,570
techniques to get this
information, all of them have

854
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,600
some drawbacks.

855
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,440
That's a great one about
WebViews using slightly

856
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,415
different APIs in
different ways.

857
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:50,730
That's a great point.

858
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,285
DARIN FISHER: Yeah.

859
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:55,700
To answer your question about
use counter and WebView, I'm

860
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,830
not actually sure if we have
a solution for that.

861
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,970
It would be fabulous
to be able to get

862
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,820
the underlying data.

863
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,300
What we have in Chrome is a
histogram system that allows

864
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,530
us to collect usage stats
for users who opt in.

865
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,770
So when they download Chrome,
they check a box and say,

866
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,820
yeah, I'd happily allow you to
collect anonymous stats to

867
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,770
help make Chrome run better.

868
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,030
And that's the kind of system
that allows us to record

869
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,310
actual usage of features and
take advantage of that to try

870
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,320
to learn what's not actually
being used.

871
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,070
It's certainly not capturing
things like WebView apps,

872
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,070
because those apps don't prompt
their users to opt them

873
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,030
into that system.

874
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,900
There might be opportunities
to leverage into Chrome Dev

875
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:44,620
Channel, Chrome Beta Channel or
if there's ever a canary on

876
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,880
Android for that sort
of thing, but we

877
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,070
don't have that yet.

878
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,770
It is a challenge.

879
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:53,130
We also, with Chrome Apps and
the Chrome Store, we have the

880
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,920
ability to crawl that data
and find usage of

881
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,860
web platform features.

882
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,670
And we have used that in the
past to find things that would

883
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,340
be unfortunate to remove.

884
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,210
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And ultimately,
if we mess up, the

885
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,460
hope is that when it's in Dev
Channel or Beta Channel,

886
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,990
someone will say, ooh, you just
broke all these lights.

887
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,430
And whoops.

888
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,690
And we'll relay it back.

889
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,090
MAX HEINRITZ: Nice.

890
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,655
Thanks.

891
00:37:16,655 --> 00:37:17,020
OK.

892
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,816
Let's do another slide
from the Moderator.

893
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:21,735
Let's hear another question
from Moderator.

894
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:24,340
The question is, "There are
various inconsistencies in the

895
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,850
security policy enforcements
between Firefox and Chrome,

896
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,910
like with cross-domain fonts
and XHR on local files.

897
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:35,380
Will you be working together
to be more consistent?"

898
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,200
ERIC SEIDEL: Yes.

899
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,610
DARIN FISHER: Next question.

900
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,090
ERIC SEIDEL: I should also
note that before this

901
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,215
presentation, I emailed
Pamela.

902
00:37:43,215 --> 00:37:45,465
And I will get her bugs,
and I will make sure

903
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:47,750
that we work on them.

904
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,215
DARIN FISHER: Cool.

905
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:48,680
MAX HEINRITZ: All right.

906
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,880
Let's do a live question.

907
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,480
Do you know which
of you is first?

908
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:52,970
OK.

909
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,440
Go ahead.

910
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,470
AUDIENCE: Regarding the better
integration between DOM

911
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,530
elements in JavaScript, what
kind of performance

912
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,120
improvements can we expect,
especially with elements that

913
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,120
are pretty complex,
such as Canvas?

914
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,860
And what would be the
timeline there?

915
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,800

916
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,770
DARIN FISHER: Were you referring
to the Oilpan

917
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,590
project that we were talking
about with &mdash;

918
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:17,920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

919
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,070
DARIN FISHER: --memory
management?

920
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:23,710
AUDIENCE: I think I read
something about exposing a

921
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,160
thinner layer around DOM
elements to JavaScript.

922
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,050
And all the calls into those
elements would be faster.

923
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,260
And I guess that would
have improvements for

924
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,450
objects like Canvas.

925
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,060
ERIC SEIDEL: So Canvas is
drawing to the screen or

926
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,110
drawing to a buffer.

927
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:47,150
And the vast majority of that
time is all spent actually

928
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,090
blitting the pixels and
turning them red

929
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,120
and blue and stuff.

930
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,210
So the stuff where you were
referring to about making the

931
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,770
DOM be able to talk to
JavaScript faster, that all

932
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,830
effects more things like when
you're traversing your whole

933
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,780
document or you're doing
a really tight loop and

934
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,040
constantly calling
some DOM API.

935
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,530
Talking to Canvas, if we have
the performance bugs there,

936
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,660
and I'm sure we do, those are
more things that we would talk

937
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,910
to our graphics team and help
make our blurs faster and our

938
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,080
fills faster and those
sorts of things.

939
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,200
And we want to fix those too.

940
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,580
So we'd love to know
about them.

941
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,330
MAX HEINRITZ: OK.

942
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,160
Audience question.

943
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,600
AUDIENCE: Yes.

944
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,880
I just had a quick question
about the Blink Project.

945
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,430
How do you go from an
implemented feature to

946
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,090
shipping that feature,
especially if

947
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,900
you're not part of Google?

948
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,492

949
00:39:36,492 --> 00:39:38,380
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So the
intention, it's

950
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,920
all done via email.

951
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,460
There might be additional
meetings to review it, if it

952
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,850
needs more talking
back and forth.

953
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,160
And of course, in that case,
whoever's implementing it

954
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,740
would be invited to those
meetings to video conference.

955
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:55,340
And our goal is that people,
even non-Googlers, can be full

956
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,230
peers in this project.

957
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,480
And we take that
very seriously.

958
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,930

959
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,250
DARIN FISHER: I believe there's
been some intent to

960
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,860
ships from folks outside
of Google.

961
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,560
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

962
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,510
I'm pretty sure that's true.

963
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:05,810
MAX HEINRITZ: Yeah.

964
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,850
I'm not sure about the intent to
ships, but we've definitely

965
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:08,600
had intent to implements.

966
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,900
Like I said, over a third have
come from non-Googlers.

967
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,590
So we try to make everything
really well documented,

968
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,360
because we understand that this
is an important thing for

969
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,240
an open source project.

970
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,660
So our project page is
chromium.org/blink.

971
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,600
And we explain everything
on there.

972
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,540
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We keep it up
to date as we're learning.

973
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,550
Because we're only a month or
so into this, and so we're

974
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,550
trying to figure out what's
the best way to balance a

975
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,750
minimum of process so you don't
have to have all kinds

976
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,960
of crazy overhead but also be
transparent, easy to follow,

977
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,770
and allow external contributors
to be peers in

978
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,744
the process and all that
kind of thing.

979
00:40:40,744 --> 00:40:41,692
AUDIENCE: OK.

980
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:42,640
MAX HEINRITZ: Go ahead.

981
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,350
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

982
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,050
Second question, how do you
become a committer?

983
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,260
Is it just like WebKit?

984
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,000
Or is it slightly different?

985
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,530
ERIC SEIDEL: It's just like
WebKit, maybe even easier.

986
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,560
There's a Chromium Committers
Policy.

987
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,580
It's like 10 commits,
sometimes sooner.

988
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,010
AUDIENCE: OK.

989
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:58,990
Thanks.

990
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,760
MAX HEINRITZ: I think that's
all the time we have.

991
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,820
I Like I said, feel free to join
us on our mailing list,

992
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,000
blink-dev@chromium or go to
our project page for more

993
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,610
information.

994
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,380
And we'll hang out for a couple
minutes after, if you

995
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,540
have other questions.

996
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,790
Thanks, guys.

997
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:16,315
