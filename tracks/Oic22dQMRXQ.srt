00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,550

00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Good
morning, everyone.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,140
Welcome to the offline
part of the day.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,570
So my involvement with all the
offline stuff started a year

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,770
and a half ago when
I joined Lanyard.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,020
And when I joined Lanyard &mdash;

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:25,286

8
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,270
so can everyone hear me?

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:27,810
Right, OK.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,730
I'll stay at this level.

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,050
So a year and a half ago,
I started at Lanyard.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,450
When I started, they were
building an iPhone app.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,560
And they were doing this mainly
just to get a presence

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,080
in the App Store, but also
because it gave them the

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,430
opportunity to make data
available offline.

16
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,000
And offline is important to
conference delegates because

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,720
you're quite often on a plane
on the way there, so you've

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,350
mostly got no connection
there.

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,030
Or when you arrive in a foreign
country, you might be

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,280
data roaming.

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,220
So we don't want you to have to
pay a lot of money just to

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,420
find out where the conference
is or what the sessions are.

23
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,510
And even when you're at the
conference, obviously

24
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,400
conferences have Wi-Fi.

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,600
But it's a special brand of
Wi-Fi known as conference

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,440
Wi-Fi, which is like Wi-Fi,
but it doesn't work.

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,000
So you can't rely on
the connection.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,260
But obviously not everyone
has an iPhone.

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,950
People have lots of different
kinds of devices.

30
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,390
And we wanted Lanyard to
work on there as well.

31
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,960
But most of these, quite a few
of these don't have an app

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,130
platform, and we didn't have the
resource to go and build

33
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,320
apps for all of then either.

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,190
So we wanted to make a web
version of the app, and that

35
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,510
was what I was there to do.

36
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,140
And when I was given this task,
I was like, well, I

37
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,590
really want to work offline
work in the

38
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,360
web version as well.

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,970
And I had this recollection of
this thing called AppCache.

40
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,500
And I went and did some
preliminary research into it.

41
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,740
And it looked really good.

42
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,890
I could just add a
reference to a

43
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,920
manifest on the HTML elements.

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,090
And I could just list
all the stuff that I

45
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,980
want to work offline.

46
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,580
And it works.

47
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,534
And I could also capture a set
of URLs, like everything that

48
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:58,560
begins with avatars &mdash; images,
avatars &mdash; and then say, well,

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,900
if you're offline, I want you
to serve that instead.

50
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,830
And I was like, wow,
this sounds like

51
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,330
a really good solution.

52
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,330
It seemed like the API was this
big, cuddly teddy bear.

53
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,892
And I kind of ran up and I
hugged the teddy bear and

54
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:12,400
thought, together, we're going
to get through this.

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,620
We can make the web
work offline.

56
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,340
Of course it soon became obvious
that the lovely teddy

57
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,520
bear that I was cuddling
was filled with

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,970
razor blades and bees.

59
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,055
And I got stung many,
many times.

60
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:29,080
And the razor blades
dug into my skin.

61
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,800
And I got the whole alphabet
of hepatitis.

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,630
And it was a really
nasty experience.

63
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,100
So you hear the word "gotcha"
a lot with AppCache.

64
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,142
And the spec does seem
to do the unexpected.

65
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:46,100
MALE SPEAKER: I think
your mic is on.

66
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Ah, yeah.

67
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,160
That would help.

68
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,710
OK.

69
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,820
Oh, that's nicer.

70
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,330
OK, so when something is cached,
it will always come

71
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,240
from the cache.

72
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,890
If the AppCache has something to
give you, it will serve it

73
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,990
straight from the cache.

74
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,580
And so even if you're online,
you're going to get those

75
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,230
cached assets.

76
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,150
And the cache is only updated
if the manifest file itself

77
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,330
changes, just a character
changes, even if that

78
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,610
character is inside a comment.

79
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,490
And the cache only updates if
all of the things you listed

80
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,105
downloads successfully.

81
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:21,870
If one of them 404s or 500s,
then the whole thing fails.

82
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,290
I started drawing this diagram
to try and make sense of what

83
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,970
AppCache was actually doing,
what the flow of information

84
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,240
was, how it worked.

85
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,130
And I did some talks based on
this, and I'm showing this

86
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,350
diagram, going, look &mdash;

87
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,670
look how terrible
that cache is.

88
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,440
Look how complicated it is.

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,700
But if you think about some code
you've written recently &mdash;

90
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,950
even something fairly simple,
like, I don't know, form

91
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,720
validation &mdash;

92
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,940
if you drew it as
a flow chart, it

93
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,160
would look like this.

94
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,330
It would look this complicated,
probably more

95
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,800
complicated.

96
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,260
And that doesn't
make it wrong.

97
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,100
And that doesn't make it
difficult to read.

98
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,820
And that doesn't make
it hard to maintain.

99
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,110
A lot of the gotchas that
AppCache has are actually

100
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,870
quite sensible.

101
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,930
So the cache is used even if
you're online, and that

102
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,985
happens because it's really,
really fast.

103
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,640
The exception is in fallback.

104
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,050
So if it tries to request an
avatar, it's going to go to

105
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,730
the network.

106
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,500
And it's only going to
serve this if the

107
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,950
network request fails.

108
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,975
And that's really quick, in this
case, because you can go

109
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:19,570
and get the avatar from the
network, and that's going to

110
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,500
be really fast.

111
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,520
It's even faster in this case
because it's going to fail

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,840
really, really quickly.

113
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,760
And you'll get the fallback
avatar instead.

114
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,860
The problem case is this,
which I like to

115
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,630
call the real world.

116
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,080
And when your phone's in this
kind of state, it's like a

117
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,670
one-legged dog.

118
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:44,010
It thinks it can still play
fetch, but it can't.

119
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,790
And you have to watch it drag
itself along the floor with

120
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,750
its one leg.

121
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,160
And it's heartbreaking.

122
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,850
And with your phone it's really,
really irritating.

123
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,800
Because you know that on the
device, on there is the data

124
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,100
that is good enough
for you right now.

125
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,110
But it won't give you it.

126
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,620
It has to wait for minutes
before it decides it really

127
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,630
can't make this connection.

128
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,990
The spec doesn't really mention
offline very much.

129
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,970
It only talks about connections
that succeeded or

130
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,450
failed, all past tense.

131
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,000
It doesn't try and predict
the state of the network.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,540
So cached data at first is good,
because it doesn't have

133
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,730
any expectation of the network,
and that's great.

134
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,660
And that's how apps behave.

135
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,060
If you open Twitter on
your phone, you've

136
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,200
got old data there.

137
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,850
And then it goes and fetches new
data if it can, if there's

138
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,950
a network connection.

139
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,660
So complexity isn't
the problem here.

140
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,340
What is the problem?

141
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,260
Well, what is the AppCache
made of?

142
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,090
There's a request cache.

143
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,160
And we can add, remove, and
update items from this.

144
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,410
And those updates are
transactional.

145
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,060
It's all atomic.

146
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,750
And it's pretty sensible.

147
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,850
There's also a router.

148
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,870
The router takes a network
connection and decides what it

149
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,030
should do with it.

150
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,180
So it can just serve stuff
straight from the cache

151
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,410
without going to network, or
it can go to network, give

152
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,860
that a go, and serve something
from the cache if that fails.

153
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,515
And that's all quite
sensible as well.

154
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:03,242
But what's our API into this?

155
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:06,040
Our API is the manifest.

156
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,980
So if I do this, I add
an empty manifest &mdash;

157
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,870
well, just with the words
cache manifest &mdash;

158
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,360
what this will do is it'll take
index.html and it will

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,460
put that into the cache.

160
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,970
And it will set up a routing
rule that says if that page is

161
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,090
requested, serve it straight
from the cache.

162
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,430
Really?

163
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,460
Did I just tell it to
do all that, just

164
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,650
with this empty file?

165
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,910
Here I'm adding a lot more
static routes, and here I'm

166
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,910
saying, hey, with this one line,
take fallback PNG, make

167
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,930
that a cache entry, put
that into the cache.

168
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,910
And if any of these URLs are
requested, set up a routing

169
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,500
rule, try and fetch it from the
network first, and if that

170
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,150
fails, then use this instead,
fallback PNG.

171
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,630
And a failure means any HTTP
status code that starts with

172
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,580
4, 404, anything that starts
with 5, or if there's a

173
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,290
redirect to another domain.

174
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,710
Did I really tell it to do
that with this one line?

175
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,870
That's a lot of assumptions
to make.

176
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,200
And if I, say, have on my HTML
page a link, an image to a

177
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,630
picture of your cat from
Flickr &mdash; do you have a cat?

178
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,480
Who has a cat?

179
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,910
Your cat &mdash; good, Bruce's cat.

180
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,330
What happens to the
image of that cat?

181
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,220
OK, so an index.html file
is a get request.

182
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,780
That's fine.

183
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,960
Is it associated with manifest?

184
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,530
Yes it is.

185
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,670
We're going to use that.

186
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,740
Is the URL AppCached?

187
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,690
Yes it is.

188
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,570
So it comes straight
from the cache.

189
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,140
That's fine.

190
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,820
Is it HTML?

191
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,790
Yes it is.

192
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,150
So for each get request on
the page, we're going

193
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,860
to go back up here.

194
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,810
And that's going to include
the picture of your cat.

195
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,830
So is the URL AppCached?

196
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,840
No.

197
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,660
Is the URL in the network
section of the manifest?

198
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,800
No.

199
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,790
Does the URL match a
fallback prefix?

200
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,490
No.

201
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,100
We've got one for avatars
but not one for

202
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,280
Bruce's cat, so no.

203
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,900
Is there a star in the
network section?

204
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,000
No.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,790
So the image will fail.

206
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,040
And the picture of Bruce's
cat will not appear.

207
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,850
It will appear as if there
was no network.

208
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,470
Even if you're online, the
picture of that cat will fail

209
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,570
to download.

210
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,840
There is nothing here to me that
suggests that picture of

211
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,250
Bruce's cat should not load.

212
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,930
I don't know what the AppCache
has against Bruce's cat, but

213
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,120
even online it's not
going to work.

214
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,620
This is a downfall API.

215
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,660
And by downfall, I don't mean
the shouty Hitler thing.

216
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,670
I'm not suggesting AppCache
is like Hitler &mdash;

217
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,820
although it is a bit.

218
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,140
No, I mean the old board game.

219
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,570
I don't know how people have
played this, but this is what

220
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,140
I feel like when I'm dealing
with AppCache.

221
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,510
I know what I'm trying to do.

222
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,539
I'm trying to get my pieces
to the bottom.

223
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,970
And I have a very limited set
of controls for that.

224
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,060
But when I'm doing this, all
kinds of shit's happening in

225
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,270
the background.

226
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,940
And I don't know what's going
on until bits start falling

227
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,020
out of the bottom that
I didn't expect.

228
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,640
And I don't know which of my
actions actually contributed

229
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,000
to that happening.

230
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,400
I know the last one that
happens, but I don't

231
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,790
everything that happened
before that.

232
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,330
The manifest is simple in terms
of the character count,

233
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,450
but there's too much implicit
going on here.

234
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,000
A better API may involve more
typing but might set out

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,870
exactly what's supposed
to happen.

236
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,990
What if in your HTML you could
say, I want to register a

237
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,050
JavaScript controller.

238
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,010
This controllers going to take
care of all URLs on the

239
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,590
origin, just slash-star.

240
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,490
And here's my JavaScript file.

241
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,050
And that was going to run
in some kind of worker.

242
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,770
And here I could just say, so
for all these files, when the

243
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,130
cache is supposed to update
itself, I want you to define a

244
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,510
cache called static, and I want
you to cache all of those

245
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,990
static URLs and do
it atomically.

246
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,040
And then when there's a request,
I want you to have a

247
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,970
look and see in the static cache
if there's something

248
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,520
that matches the incoming URL.

249
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,560
And if there is a resource,
prevent default.

250
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
Don't do the default
browser action.

251
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,160
Respond with that resource
from the cache.

252
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,075
This is a lot more typing than
the equivalent that you did in

253
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,250
the manifest, but it's
really explicit.

254
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,070
You're setting up exactly
what you want to happen.

255
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,180
There's no magic here.

256
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,960
You can define your own magic.

257
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,950
This is a bring your
own unicorn API.

258
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,580
You do all that stuff
yourself.

259
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,040
What if I could say, OK, I'm
going to set up a route for

260
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,130
get requests.

261
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,670
Anything that starts with
avatars, prevent the default.

262
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,610
I want you to try and get
it from the network.

263
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,860
But on an error, I want you to
see if we've got something,

264
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,220
the fallback PNG in
the resource.

265
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,700
And if there is, I'm
going to serve it.

266
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,200
So that's the equivalent of
your fallback, but you're

267
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,580
telling it exactly what to do.

268
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,000
What if I could listen to
messages from the web page

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,640
that's happening?

270
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,210
So imagine something like DFT,
where there's issues.

271
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,760
And the user might have said,
I want to cache this issue.

272
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,140
So he posted a message saying,
cache the issue.

273
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,740
And [INAUDIBLE]

274
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,240
receives that, caches define
issue, and then the issue

275
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,620
number, and the URLs
to cache for that.

276
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,280
And then when those requests
come in, anything that's URL

277
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,440
issue and a number, we're
going to deal with that.

278
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,080
We're going to say get me the
cache for that issue.

279
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,240
If we have that cached and we
have a URL inside that cache

280
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,950
that matches what's being
requested, serve it.

281
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,820
Otherwise, if the request type
is a navigate, as in, someone

282
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,490
is changing page, it's going to
be a full reload, prevent

283
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,220
the default.

284
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,850
Respond &mdash;

285
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,570
try and fetch it from the
network as normal.

286
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,820
And if that fails, and the
status code was zero, which

287
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,380
suggests a lack of network
connection, then serve a thing

288
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,880
from the cache saying, no, I'm
afraid you don't have that

289
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,520
issue cached, here's why.

290
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,800
And that's something we can't
do with AppCache now.

291
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,810
Maybe you could do stuff like
get stuff from local storage

292
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,170
and then use Mustache to
render it, or whatever

293
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,840
templating language
you included.

294
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,470
We could just completely build
an app up from this experience

295
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,560
and completely define how
it should behave.

296
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,690
So even someone who is
unfamiliar with the API would

297
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,370
have a good idea of
what it's doing.

298
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,910
They wouldn't have to read a
whole spec to understand

299
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,990
what's going on.

300
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,960
What if we could do that?

301
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,650
And I think that's what we're
going to discuss, or

302
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,840
things around it.

303
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,854
I don't how this transition &mdash;
you have to clap.

304
00:11:53,854 --> 00:12:10,270
[APPLAUSE]

305
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,175
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Watch
out, watch out.

306
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:13,012
I think that's Andrew's
seat, isn't it?

307
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:21,880

308
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,230
ANDREW BETTIS: Right.

309
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,440
So I realized when Jake started
that I completely

310
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,100
forgot to big up all
the people on the

311
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,150
panel before we started.

312
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,640
So we have Jake, who's obviously
just given his talk.

313
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,000
He's now developed relations
for Google,

314
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,820
formerly from Lanyard.

315
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,090
Mark Christian from Twitter,
who also created one of the

316
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,986
first informative sites about
AppCache, appcachefaqs.info.

317
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:54,860
Alex Russell, also from Google,
who is co-author of

318
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,080
the proposal that Jake was just
talking about, with the

319
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,210
navigation controller.

320
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,350
And Jonas Sicking from Mozilla,
who has very kindly

321
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,310
signed up at the very last
minute to replace [INAUDIBLE]

322
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,850
Tobie Langel, who's
unfortunately unable to make

323
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,020
it because he's ill.

324
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,600
So let's get started.

325
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,430

326
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,980
So we have loads of questions
in moderator about offline.

327
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,590
And I think the most burning
one for me, and I think the

328
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:28,900
one that's most relevant to
DFT is why is there such a

329
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,830
constraint on what we
can do offline?

330
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,340
Why do we have such tiny limits
on what we can store?

331
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,490
And is this a problem that we
need to solve at the spec

332
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:44,830
level, or do we need an entire
new technology to solve it?

333
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,520
Jake, why don't you start?

334
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,730
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK, so if you're
building something,

335
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,490
it's going to be running
on multiple devices.

336
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,040
So you can't make too many
expectations of the amount of

337
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,660
data that you would be able to
store on a particular device.

338
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,260
That said, one of the things
we were looking at is the

339
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,330
ability to request a
permanent cache.

340
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,920
Because one of the problems
we've got with the current

341
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,968
cache is the browser may
object at any point.

342
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:14,844
Has my microphone
gone off again?

343
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:15,782
Oh, whatever.

344
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:18,000
So the browser can just get
rid of it at any point.

345
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,250
Oh, hello.

346
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,680

347
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,920
So what AppCache gives you is
it says, one of these assets

348
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,560
is not going to be ejected
from the cache.

349
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,540
If anything's going to be
ejected, they're all going to

350
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,670
be ejected together.

351
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,620
And the spec doesn't say that
this stuff's going to be

352
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,980
around forever.

353
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,740
So the idea is if we could
make it where you would

354
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,550
request a permanent cache, maybe
of a particular size,

355
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,250
then you could do
that and that.

356
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,340
And because a user would agree
to give you that, they are

357
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,700
also now in control of
uninstalling something.

358
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,210
So if there is a lack of space,
like they run out of

359
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,090
space on their phone, then it's
down to them to decide

360
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,910
what to keep and what to lose.

361
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,930
So they might go and say, well,
this small FT app is

362
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,970
very important to me, whereas
these big game apps are not.

363
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,000
And it's their decision
of what to do?

364
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,870
ANDREW BETTIS: So what's the
limit on what's reasonable?

365
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,490
What's reasonable for an app
to acclaim for its own

366
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,770
exclusive use?

367
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,650
ALE RUSSELL: How is
that a question

368
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,631
for the app to answer?

369
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,940
It's usually a question for
the user to answer.

370
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,950
This is about the user agent
mediating the conversation

371
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,972
between the app developer and
the user, who is the owner of

372
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:26,880
the device.

373
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,670
And so you're trying to enable
that conversation to happen in

374
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,340
an informed way.

375
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,960
And usually that doesn't
mean, can I

376
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,010
have some bit of storage.

377
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,810
It's usually did I mean
to install this thing?

378
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,810
Did I mean to turn this into
a real thing that's not an

379
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,942
ephemeral page that I happen
to load and unload.

380
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,380
The question is, have my
expectations been violated by

381
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,475
navigating naked
to a web page.

382
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:50,455
Did that imply that
100 megabytes was

383
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:53,010
taken on disk per page?

384
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,948
If I'm going to Facebook every
day, maybe it does.

385
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:57,065
Maybe that's a reasonable
thing to do.

386
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:59,310
If I go to Twitter and I like
to see all my history, maybe

387
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,680
that's the most reasonable
thing I

388
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,780
could possibly imagine.

389
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,670
But that's a decision that
I as a user should be

390
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,790
at least part of.

391
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,000
And so today we don't have
that way to mediate it.

392
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,810
And so I [INAUDIBLE]

393
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,892
there was an additional proposal
yesterday that Jonas

394
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:18,625
and others at Mozilla were
working on to layer on top of

395
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:24,360
this API that we have shown a
little bit of, the idea of a

396
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,550
more declarative manifest that
has more to say about what the

397
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,910
thing is that you would
take an action on.

398
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,300
JONAS SICKING: There's
a few things here.

399
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,131
First of all, you shouldn't
think of the web as being

400
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:41,600
different from native
applications.

401
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,170
Native applications, once you
install a native application,

402
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,803
it can write as much
as it wants.

403
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:48,885
Why should the web not be able
to do that, assuming the

404
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:49,850
user's fine with it.

405
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,852
So we need to have some way of
communicating between the

406
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:59,540
application and the user that
the user thinks this website

407
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:05,858
is important and then wants to
enable it to store data on the

408
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,490
local device.

409
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,539
So that is really something
we would need to enable.

410
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:17,510
Google actually has some
interesting ideas here in the

411
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,970
[INAUDIBLE]

412
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,329
API, where they have this
concept of temporary storage

413
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,609
and permanent storage.

414
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,770
That concept is something we
are working on expanding so

415
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,665
you can use that storage area to
store essentially anything

416
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:31,915
that you can store locally, you
can choose to [INAUDIBLE]

417
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:33,650
store permanently
or temporary.

418
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,750
And the user can then
be involved.

419
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,980
And we can also use heuristics
in the browser.

420
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,405
Like, if we know that the user
is using a website a lot, we

421
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:45,145
can grant that website more
implicit storage, and we can

422
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:48,250
be more careful about when
we eject that data.

423
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,180
Or we can also enable the
website to say, I want to

424
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,610
really lock this down.

425
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,080
And then once the user's OK with
that, we can guarantee

426
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,014
that certain data is
available offline.

427
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:01,970
So the goal should really be
that anything that native

428
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,590
applications can do when it
comes to sorting data locally,

429
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,520
the web should be able to do.

430
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,640
And that shouldn't be
hard to accomplish.

431
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,310
ANDREW BETTIS: Is it currently
a problem that a user giving

432
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:18,170
explicit consent to store
something as an explicit

433
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,090
intention to store, but
then the browser can

434
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,660
implicitly purge it?

435
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,340
Is that a bug, do you think,
currently in implementation?

436
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,900
Should it be the case that
anything that's explicitly

437
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,665
given permission to be stored
should be explicitly removed

438
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,300
by the user?

439
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,280
JONAS SICKING: I think we need
to enable the scenario where

440
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,000
you're guaranteed that
something is wrong.

441
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,940
The only way to guarantee that
something is wrong is to take

442
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,322
up storage on the user's device,
which means taking

443
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:50,830
resource away from the user.

444
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,180
And so the user needs to be
involved in that decision.

445
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,370
But in many cases, you don't
need that level of guarantee.

446
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,730
And you could probably build
pretty good heuristics so that

447
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,230
things mostly work without
the user being involved.

448
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,760
But I also think that we need
to enable websites to say,

449
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,780
hey, I really want to be able to
guarantee this to the user,

450
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,230
in which case we can
have interaction.

451
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,090
We can have a security
dialogue.

452
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,710
But as long as we make that
flow nice and don't ask &mdash;

453
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:24,340
like Firefox currently does,
asks you three times before it

454
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,400
grants you that permission.

455
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,570
It should be within the control
of the website when to

456
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,420
ask the user.

457
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,250
And it should only
be one question.

458
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,773
The user should just say, yeah,
I'm OK with giving this

459
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,551
website a little bit
more information.

460
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,240
And we shouldn't need to ask
about individual [INAUDIBLE].

461
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,450
ANDREW BETTIS: So can
I just a quick poll?

462
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,130
Who here has run out of space
when they were building an

463
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,840
offline app?

464
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,670
So we have a few
people who've &mdash;

465
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,630
OK, interesting.

466
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,880
ALEX RUSSELL: I think it's
also a UX issue.

467
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,670
There's the what is it
that I'm doing here?

468
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,790
Are we going to ask users
honestly to go reason about

469
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,070
their storage independently of
what the application is?

470
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,530
I don't think that people,
generally speaking &mdash; certainly

471
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:13,220
not the app platform models
that we have today &mdash;

472
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,690
I don't think people reason
about them independently.

473
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,390
You have an application, and
that means that you have its

474
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,320
data as well.

475
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,300
And we don't really have a
reified idea of what an

476
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,990
application is.

477
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,180
That's the thing that we don't
have, as a unit of something

478
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,130
that we can communicate
to end users today.

479
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,680
And Mozilla's building an app
platform, and we're building

480
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,480
an app platform.

481
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,990
And they helped unify
that concept.

482
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,420
And it feels to me like
helping to make that

483
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,600
transition from I've got a page
to look, it's also an

484
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,160
application &mdash;

485
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,840
I think that's really the big
transition for everyone who's

486
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,060
building apps, both conceptually
as you're

487
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,230
building them and for users
who are consuming them.

488
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,200
I'd like to talk more at some
point about what it means to

489
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,780
transition as a builder thinking
about an app &mdash;

490
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,080
ANDREW BETTIS: Well, your
microphone's not working.

491
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,510
So next time you want to speak,
just let me know.

492
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,940
And you can speak into mine.

493
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,850
MALE SPEAKER: His
mic works fine.

494
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,666
But he can't talk over his
shoulder to Andrew.

495
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,940
He's got to talk directly
[INAUDIBLE].

496
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,840
ALEX RUSSELL: Sorry
about that.

497
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,500
MARK CHRISTIAN: So I think that
part of the problem with

498
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,150
the situation right now is that
web applications feel a

499
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,990
little bit different than
websites, but they're all

500
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,440
running in the same universe.

501
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,270
And when you're building an
application, you want to have

502
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,090
quite a bit of control over
how you're storing your

503
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,710
resources and managing the
user data, whereas

504
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,460
historically, web APIs have been
more like suggestions to

505
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,180
the user agent.

506
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,940
It's up to the user agent to
interpret what's going on and

507
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,840
deal with it appropriately.

508
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,230
AppCache demonstrates that
there's a lot of assumptions

509
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,040
built into that that don't
always work, and it makes it

510
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,995
difficult to have a consistent
experience.

511
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:41,880
So I think part of the problem
is actually philosophical.

512
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,220
As we go forward and build a new
API, how much control do

513
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,300
we want to let these
applications have?

514
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,420
And it's a trust
issue as well.

515
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,610
Going to a random website, how
much trust does that actually

516
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,630
imply that user has?

517
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,120
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think we could
spend the whole of today

518
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,000
trying to work out what the
difference between a website

519
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,730
and a web app is.

520
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,270
And I think at the end of it,
we'd say, well, does it

521
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,150
actually matter?

522
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,480
Once we've made that decision,
what would we do differently?

523
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,560
So I think this API we're making
now would work fine for

524
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,540
sites and work fine for apps.

525
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,430
What do you see as the
difference between the two?

526
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,130
MARK CHRISTIAN: Probably
persistence of storage and

527
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,600
amount of storage.

528
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,690
Those are the characteristics.

529
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,870
Do you want a random website to
be able to dump a gigabyte

530
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,580
of data onto your hard drive?

531
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, I might
if it's Wikipedia.

532
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,015
I might want to download
Wikipedia as a site.

533
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:36,060
MARK CHRISTIAN: Yeah,
I might too.

534
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,390
But there's no good model for
letting a user illustrate that

535
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,868
that's actually what
they really wanted.

536
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:43,485

537
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:46,680
JONAS SICKING: I think one
problem we have is that

538
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,869
historically websites have been
these things where, as a

539
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,720
browser, we treat them as &mdash;
we have no idea if this is

540
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,280
something that the user
actually likes.

541
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,540
It might be just some random
website that the user found

542
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,520
through a link in
a spam email.

543
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,820
And so we have this very
distrusting relationship of

544
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,700
the website.

545
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,915
And as we're trying to expand
the web into being able to do

546
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:14,810
more things, we have to enable
the user to indicate, I

547
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,510
actually trust this website.

548
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,440
I actually enjoy this website.

549
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,750
I want this website to be able
to do things that [INAUDIBLE]

550
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,160
shouldn't be able to do.

551
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,780
So we need some way, some
UX to enable the user to

552
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,670
communicate to the browser that,
hey, it's OK for this

553
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,550
website to get some extra
capabilities.

554
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,960
So one way of doing this is
app platforms that both

555
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,290
Firefox and Chrome OS is having,
which enables the

556
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,905
users to go through this install
flow, at which point,

557
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:54,760
you indicated that yeah, I trust
this website enough that

558
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,490
I have installed it.

559
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,560
We should enable those
capabilities not just through

560
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,892
install flow but also through
other means where it's still a

561
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:07,150
website, UX-wise, but you've
indicated some other way that

562
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,160
it's OK for this guy to
use more resources.

563
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,290
The two things in Firefox OS
that we're giving a website

564
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,535
once it's installed is ability
to use resources and ability

565
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:18,760
to annoy the user.

566
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,140
So on the web, we built
pop-up blockers.

567
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,400
We tried to disable this ability
of disabling the

568
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,380
context menu.

569
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,790
And a lot of the things that
it's really nice if the good

570
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,120
guys can do but we don't want
the bad guys to do.

571
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:38,030
And so if we can have some way
to use UX to indicate that

572
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,100
this website should be able to
do things, then we can enable

573
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,650
much more [INAUDIBLE].

574
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,130
ANDREW BETTIS: Do you think that
using app runtimes as a

575
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:51,230
solution to offline problems
is good enough?

576
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,940
Or do you think that we ought
to be able to solve these

577
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,680
problems without using
app runtime?

578
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,290
JONAS SICKING: I think app
runtimes is a good way for us

579
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:03,100
to experiment, but
it's an easy out.

580
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,390
We have this traditional sense
of what an application is.

581
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,320
And traditional users know what
it means to install an

582
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,525
application, as far as I know
that this enables this

583
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:17,120
application to do more things.

584
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,080
I shouldn't install
it if I hate it.

585
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,520
So it gives us an easy
out, but it's

586
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,415
definitely not good enough.

587
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:29,430
There needs to be a fluid
transition from being a

588
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,760
potentially evil spam website
that the user has navigated to

589
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,100
being a fully-trusted
installed app.

590
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,330
It's a smooth transition.

591
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,580
And the user, as you're slowly
getting more and more familiar

592
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,990
with the website, it shouldn't
be a hard path.

593
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,980
It should be, you trust it more
and more, and it gets

594
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,002
more and more capabilities as
the user gives it more and

595
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:49,591
more trust.

596
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:53,430
App runtimes is definitely
not enough of an answer.

597
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,760
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, we've been
through that same problem

598
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,490
before with Flash.

599
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,060
I mean, we went for so long with
not adding these APIs to

600
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,840
HTML, saying, oh, if you want
those kind of capabilities, do

601
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,900
it in a plug-in.

602
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,970
And we're seeing the same again
with, oh, if you want

603
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,040
those kind of things, just
do it in an app.

604
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,340
We shouldn't let that stop us
making the platform better.

605
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,080
ANDREW BETTIS: Jake and Alex,
you're proposing actually a

606
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,460
controller that gives the
developer a lot of flexibility

607
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,953
over how they respond to
offline situations.

608
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:24,530

609
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,320
There's a great question in
Moderator which is, how would

610
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,280
you propose to use that
to handle the

611
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,266
one-legged dog scenario?

612
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:37,910
ALEX RUSSELL: So I think
the answer to this is &mdash;

613
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,850
it's a little bit circuitous,
so stick with me.

614
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,100
The way AppCache works,
generally speaking, when it

615
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,500
works, is to help you take the
shell of an application, the

616
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,640
thing that will load content
and then display it to you

617
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,730
while your offline, package that
up, and make it available

618
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,390
to you at all points.

619
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,920
What Jake showed you was a great
way for you to package

620
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,890
up the shell of a content
application using AppCache.

621
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,910
There's a related question,
which is inflated by the API

622
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,520
of AppCache, unfortunately,
which is, how do I then deal

623
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,010
with the content that I'm
loading inside this shell?

624
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,850
Because every app you
load in native

625
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,995
environment has this duality.

626
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:15,520
I've got shell, and I've got a
library of content that I'm

627
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,400
navigating.

628
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,730
And if you think about the way
you're building things on the

629
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,680
server, you do exactly
the same thing.

630
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,120
You've got this node graph of
content that you're allowing

631
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,890
users to transition through,
and they're

632
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,510
all mapped to URLs.

633
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,400
But you usually take the little
bit of content that's

634
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,670
unique to that URL, and you
smash a gigantic template

635
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,610
thing around it, and you spit
it all out as a string, and

636
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,160
then you rehydrate it
on the client side.

637
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,185
But that isn't what the URL
is really addressing.

638
00:27:39,185 --> 00:27:41,500
The URL addresses that little
bit of content, that unique

639
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,640
bit of indivisible content
that you're

640
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,700
serving at that URL.

641
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,390
And it may be multiple nodes all
joined into one particular

642
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,020
serialization.

643
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,610
But that's sort of the idea.

644
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,530
So the question is, how do
we enable people to build

645
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,650
application architectures
offline, which easily give you

646
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,080
that shell and the ability to
cache resources which you will

647
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,140
load inside that shell, so that
you can discover them, so

648
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,580
you can load them, you can
provide the fallback

649
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,060
experience if you
don't have them.

650
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,560
Today, AppCache rolls them
all into one manifest.

651
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,190
Because today, if you actually
take the AppCache to its

652
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,350
logical conclusion, what you
realize at the end of this

653
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,870
long, painful journey &mdash; which
Jake took, and which the Gmail

654
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,160
team took, and which a lot of
people who have been building

655
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,130
offline apps have taken
independently &mdash;

656
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,900
is that AppCache is the
thing that you use

657
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,000
to cache the shell.

658
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,920
And for all other content, which
you would have liked to

659
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,650
have given a nice URL, what you
do is you build an ad hoc

660
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,410
synchronization protocol, you
put it in Web SQL Database or

661
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,120
IndexDB or local storage.

662
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,620
And then every time someone
navigates to that URL, you try

663
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,280
to override what the browser
was going to do to navigate

664
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,120
you, go get it out of the local
storage if you have it,

665
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,600
and then perform your
own synchronization

666
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,450
on that data model.

667
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,930
So you have a data model which
is not represented at those

668
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,100
URLs anymore.

669
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,020
So the default model is
effectively URL hostile.

670
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,730
And the only thing that's helped
by having it at a URL

671
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,040
is loading the initial shell,
which is the least meaningful

672
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,840
thing in terms of URL space.

673
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,330
So what you'd really like to
do in all this is to help

674
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,000
application owners understand
through the API that your

675
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,050
caching two separate
sets of things.

676
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,640
There's a shell, which is your
browser for your content.

677
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,530
There's the browser that
you browse to different

678
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,610
sites and apps with.

679
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,210
But there's the browser that you
build for the content that

680
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,290
you're surfacing inside
your app.

681
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,190
And then there's the
content of the app.

682
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,990
You need to treat them
independently, but you'd like

683
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,490
them both to be cacheable
as HTTP resources.

684
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,710
So the way to get there is
to change expectations.

685
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,480
There's no app that you're
going to build that's

686
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,150
meaningful that's not
offline by default.

687
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,100
AppCache gets you part of the
way there, because it makes

688
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,330
the resources for your app
shell offline by default.

689
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,710
But it doesn't necessarily do
anything particular for the

690
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,400
resources that you would like
to load inside that shell.

691
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,880
So we have to make this
transition in thinking about

692
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,950
building apps in this world,
which is, we're not building a

693
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,500
series of HTML pages that you're
going to serialize at a

694
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,390
URL fully formed from the server
side as strings that

695
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,990
you're going to put back
into the cache.

696
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,900
It's nonsensical.

697
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,110
It doesn't work.

698
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,570
Instead what you're going to do
is you're going to assume

699
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,720
that there's a shell that's
booted, and you're moving

700
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,110
between the cached resources,
and if you can get to them,

701
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,820
the uncached ones.

702
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,260
And that means that you're
always working from this local

703
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,900
store of your shell and your
content in order to do

704
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,690
everything.

705
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,300
And that's the big transition
that has been conflated with

706
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,330
the use of AppCache over time.

707
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,970
And everyone discovers that
that's what AppCache implies,

708
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,710
but it's not clear.

709
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,370
And it's not clear that that's
how you have to build your

710
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,940
application to be successful.

711
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,850
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I would see
the model working if you

712
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,600
imagine an app &mdash;

713
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,490
I think I'm all right.

714
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,710
If you imagine an app &mdash;
no, I'm not.

715
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,410
If you imagine an app where it's
a series of messages from

716
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,750
people you're subscribed to &mdash;

717
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,440
basically Twitter &mdash;

718
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,230
if you visit the page and you
don't have a controller

719
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,200
installed, and you don't have
JavaScript, the server is

720
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,690
going to construct all
of this stuff.

721
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,520
You'll have to wait for a
network who responds, and

722
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,490
you'll get it how internet
should work today.

723
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,860
If you have a controller
installed, it's going to

724
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,710
respond with an empty content
shell of the UI, it's going to

725
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,730
kick off an XHR or request on
your page, but it's going to

726
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,980
have a header or query
strings saying, I'm

727
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,280
OK with cached data.

728
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,112
The controller is going to
see that and return the

729
00:31:15,112 --> 00:31:16,300
last data you saw.

730
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,500
You're going to build
up the page.

731
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,270
And that's going to
happen instantly.

732
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,710
But then it will set off another
XHR, something in a

733
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,370
query string, saying, I want
this data to come from online.

734
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,600
And that connection will either
succeed, in which case

735
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,120
you'll replace the content on
the screen with the new stuff,

736
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,865
or it will fail, and you'll
fail silently.

737
00:31:32,865 --> 00:31:35,900
And that's your offline
experience.

738
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,730
ANDREW BETTIS: Can I pick up &mdash;

739
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,960
you were talking about the
failure scenario of trying to

740
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,750
load content and then it failing
and falling back to

741
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,940
content from cache.

742
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,140
So the biggest problem we have
with AppCache with the

743
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,840
fallback is that you can't
control that timeout.

744
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,850
You can't determine how long
that's going to be, and it's

745
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,990
usually longer than a user
is prepared to wait.

746
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,230
So in the scenario of using a
navigation controller, in

747
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,750
which you'd be able to configure
what that timeout

748
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,376
is, how long are you
prepared to wait?

749
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,520

750
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,550
ALEX RUSSELL: You have explicit
control under the

751
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,700
controller scenario over
the loading process.

752
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,730
So you are able to make
a decision when you're

753
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,180
dispatching the request in the
first place, do I know that

754
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm offline?

755
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,480
The only thing that we can
actually tell you from the

756
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,020
browser's perspective about
your online versus offline

757
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,460
state is that you are
definitively not connected to

758
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,280
any network.

759
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,150
We can't tell you whether or not
you can hit your server.

760
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,900
We can't tell you anything about
what's reasonable in

761
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,830
terms of expectation for
hitting your server.

762
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,800
We can tell you if you're behind
a hostile proxy or

763
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,080
inside of a captive portal
from some Wi-Fi thing.

764
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,330
We can't tell you any of that.

765
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,740
That's going to be up to
your application to

766
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,690
have to figure out.

767
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,080
And the way you do that is by
making one these requests and

768
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,550
then watching what happens.

769
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:45,450
So yes, you'll be able to cancel
the request and respond

770
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,040
with I have no idea
what's going on.

771
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,410
And it's going to be explicitly
under your control,

772
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,550
which is to say that you'll
explicitly have to provide

773
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,630
that functionality.

774
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,030
But that's a damn sight better
than trying to have to figure

775
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,360
out a way to make AppCache
do it right now.

776
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,040
ANDREW BETTIS: And here's
another quick

777
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,520
question from Moderator.

778
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,100
Is there scope for a standard
way of synchronizing content

779
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,710
from server to client
and vice versa?

780
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,800
JONAS SICKING: So

781
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,920
synchronization is really hard.

782
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,205
Once you get into two-way
synchronization, which is what

783
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:21,970
you often get into, there's
no standard way of

784
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,080
synchronizing data.

785
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,750
It's very, very application
specific, how you deal with

786
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,000
merged conflicts.

787
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,930

788
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:36,050
So one answer is simply no,
we can't solve this.

789
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,020
There are some interesting
approaches that may work.

790
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,016
So Couch, for example, does this
thing where it allows you

791
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:44,170
to synchronize data, but
it doesn't actually

792
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:44,990
deal with the merging.

793
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,770
So you can pull down data, and
the local data that you end up

794
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,460
with explicitly contains
the conflict.

795
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,810
And then after the fact, once
you run code, then you can

796
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,770
deal with that conflict.

797
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,220
And so potentially we can build

798
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,270
something around that model.

799
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,255
But I think dealing with
synchronization is really,

800
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:06,940
really hard.

801
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,409
I think in the beginning
we need to just.

802
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,980
ANDREW BETTIS: Are we just
asking for trouble here?

803
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,030
I mean, are we just asking
to build something that

804
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,610
developers will say, that
doesn't quite work the way I

805
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,380
want it to, so I'm going
to build my own?

806
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,909
ALEX RUSSELL: I think the thing
that will get you in

807
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,449
trouble is making assumptions
about the developers' data

808
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,239
model, which were not
collaborative.

809
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:31,280
So if we provide developers a
data model which we constrain

810
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,760
tightly, like, if we provide
a straight transition chart

811
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,239
system that you can then speak
in high-level terms about the

812
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,330
changes between the states of
your applications, and then we

813
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,139
can watch those in a way that,
say, a SQL database watches

814
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,469
the SQL queries that come in and
the transactions and the

815
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:49,830
commits and you can then make a
binary log of them, then you

816
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,370
can start to do something about
the synchronization of

817
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,150
the high-level application
semantics.

818
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,090
But as much as people would like
to pretend that HTML is

819
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,450
semantic, it ain't.

820
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,040
HTML today, in most of its use
cases, ain't semantic.

821
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,690
You're not saying anything more
meaningful than div, div,

822
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,290
div, div, div.

823
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,320
And your mutations of HTML are
no more meaningful that show

824
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,950
or hide this particular
piece of UI.

825
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,700
They don't relate specifically,
in most cases,

826
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,960
except in a tangential way, to
I'm changing this particular

827
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,530
piece of state in my data model,
which is what you're

828
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,540
trying to synchronize.

829
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,390
And so we don't have a local
idea of a data model.

830
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,670
Therefore we can't really cons
up the idea of a local

831
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,090
synchronization store.

832
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,530
I think that the next iteration
of the library wars

833
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,610
will be about data models
locally and synchronization.

834
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,470
My guess is that people are
going to start doing

835
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,900
operational transform libraries
out of the woodwork.

836
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,010
It's going to be amazing.

837
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,720
We're starting to see this a
little bit with Meteor and

838
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,360
some other libraries that are
starting to apply some good

839
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,200
computer science to the
question of how do I

840
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,590
differentiate what's happening
when I change it?

841
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,230
How do I prevent merge conflicts
in the first place,

842
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,090
by dealing in high-level
operations, and not in, oh

843
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,770
look, some field was
added or removed?

844
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,070
And we're starting to add good
support for being able to

845
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,020
build these libraries into both
the language and the DOM.

846
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,260
There's something called
object.observe and mutation

847
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,740
observers, which are way of
observing those changes as

848
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,600
they happen and responding to
high-level events and not the

849
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,150
low-level primitives changing
out from underneath you.

850
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,060
But we've got a very long way
collectively to go to get to

851
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,410
an agreement whereby we as
browser vendors would feel, I

852
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,460
think, reasonably comfortable
in blessing one particulars

853
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,740
strategy for describing your
data and then another strategy

854
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,100
for synchronizing it.

855
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,550
ANDREW BETTIS: So has anyone
here implemented any kind of

856
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,250
offline sync, any kind
of ability to

857
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,530
synchronize data to browser?

858
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:38,910
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

859
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,090
ANDREW BETTIS: OK, so what's
your use case?

860
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:50,480

861
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,560
MALE SPEAKER: It's exactly how
you just described it.

862
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,920
The AppCache hosts the shell,
and everything else comes from

863
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,070
local storage.

864
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:04,470
So local storage is the user
data, AppCache is the shell.

865
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,910
And it assumes from the
beginning that the user is

866
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:12,760
going to have no data and then
tries to fetch over an AJAX

867
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,625
request and feeds into
local storage.

868
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:18,910

869
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,110
MARK CHRISTIAN: I think most
of the problems with

870
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:24,830
synchronization are less data
model than we would think.

871
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,260
I feel like it's actually
a feasible problem.

872
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,980
If you look at stuff like
iCloud, you can offer a couple

873
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,360
of pretty basic data
strategies.

874
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,115
Like, I've got a key value
store, or I've

875
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:36,260
got a record store.

876
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,840
You don't need to build up
particularly complex models in

877
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,170
the browser to actually
be able to support &mdash;

878
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:47,160
there's this thing, it has a
GUID, and you can say whatever

879
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,050
the most recent changed
version is works.

880
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,640
ALEX RUSSELL: So you're positing
that one default

881
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,880
strategy across multi-tenant
synchronization will work,

882
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,090
that there's only a single user,
and that user's last

883
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,970
change is going to be
synchronized and timed

884
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,100
correctly across multiple
systems.

885
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,840
And you're saying that there's
a closed form over the

886
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,250
operations that I can take.

887
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,990
You do need the closed form, but
you need the ability for

888
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,440
applications to specify the
operations that they will

889
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,420
allow on their data and what it
means for them to change a

890
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,610
piece of data.

891
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,980
Yes, you can bring users down to
one model of mutating data

892
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,180
and what that semantic
is for mutation.

893
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,230
And you can constrain the set of
things that they will then

894
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,680
reasonably be able to do in
the app without hitting

895
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,970
synchronization issues
based on this policy.

896
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,710
You could do that, but I don't
feel like it's our job as a

897
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,570
platform right now to make that
kind of a call in quite

898
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,280
such a closed way.

899
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,930
Because I don't think that we've
got the experience in

900
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,730
our community for that's
the right thing to do.

901
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,055
I can tell you right now that
that would not work for Gmail.

902
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:47,880
It honestly would not
work for Gmail.

903
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,850
It wouldn't work for Sync.

904
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,050
It wouldn't have worked
for Wave.

905
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,420
It doesn't work for Plus.

906
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,120
It won't fly.

907
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,220
ANDREW BETTIS: Mark, can you
tell us why Twitter doesn't

908
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,770
currently use offline?

909
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,974
MARK CHRISTIAN: Well, Twitter's
web platform is in a

910
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:01,320
bit of flux.

911
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,660
We're moving towards
a server as the

912
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,660
ultimate source of truth.

913
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,730
So we actually don't do any
client side rendering at all.

914
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,400
So any navigation event, even
though it's happening AJAXly,

915
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,090
is actually just injecting a
response from the server.

916
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,070
So you can't really cache that
nearly as efficiently as you

917
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,550
could a series of JSON
responses, for example,

918
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,460
because they're full-page
responses.

919
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,630
So not every AJAX model is going
to work as well with

920
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,480
that sort of a strategy.

921
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,280
Whether that changes
in the future, TBD.

922
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,670
But basically, two competing
styles of how you want to have

923
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,780
a fast responsive app, you have
something that lives on

924
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,940
the server, something that lives
entirely on the client.

925
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,790
And having something that can
react to both is actually a

926
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,420
messy, terrible proposition
right now.

927
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,270

928
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,090
JAKE ARCHIBALD: The way we did
that at Lanyard was we were

929
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:55,590
rendering on the server with
Mustache and some data.

930
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,320
And then when we were doing the
same on the client with

931
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,170
offline, we were using the same
Mustache templates, and

932
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,180
we were caching the same data
model in local storage, the

933
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,870
same as you were.

934
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,850
And obviously we'd rather be
doing that in AppCache.

935
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:12,170
So yeah, you can still do the
progressive enhancement thing

936
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,650
and have a client-based
app, and you're not

937
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,260
duplicating too much data.

938
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,940
And did anyone see the "B&B"
article recently where they

939
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,270
were talking about, hey, we've
decided to try this new,

940
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,150
exciting idea.

941
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,900
And what we're going to do is
we're going to render content

942
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,810
on the server, and we're
going to send out an

943
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,170
HTML string of content.

944
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,710
And it's amazingly fast.

945
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,960
You guys should all
be doing this.

946
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,470

947
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,320
Yeah, we've been calling that
progressive enhancement.

948
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,340
MARK CHRISTIAN: Well, that's
sort of our model too.

949
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,145
Twitter's famously, remember,
the hashbang website a couple

950
00:40:46,145 --> 00:40:47,010
of years ago.

951
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,750
It was actually pretty speedy
if you were on a MacBook Pro

952
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,940
with the latest version
of Chrome.

953
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,335
But if you were using IE7 in
Bangalore, it was actually an

954
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:56,310
atrocious experience.

955
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,600
And so the server side model
ends up working a lot better

956
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,700
on the low end.

957
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,080
And the problem with having two
rendering stacks, even if

958
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,120
they're sharing templates, is
that you've got quirks between

959
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,380
your view implementation.

960
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,700
And that is a great way to kill
yourself with 1,000 paper

961
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,210
cuts, especially if you're on
a large dev team with a few

962
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,006
dozen developers trying to
keep it all in sync.

963
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,210
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, I completely
agree with that.

964
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,190
Because we were using Mustache,
and we ended up

965
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:22,610
pretty much owning, or making
massive contributions to about

966
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,950
four different implementations
of Mustache the Python one,

967
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:30,150
the Java one, the IOS one,
and the JavaScript one.

968
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,090
MARK CHRISTIAN: There's one
developer at Twitter who's

969
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,180
single-handedly written
two from scratch &mdash;

970
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,590
Hogan and Eckersley &mdash;

971
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,310
just because most of the
implementations had

972
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,240
some sort of issue.

973
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,910
ANDREW BETTIS: So are you
saying, then, that the only

974
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,150
real use case for offline
technologies is when you

975
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,320
actually want to build an
offline app rather than to

976
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,970
improve the performance
of your app?

977
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,220
MARK CHRISTIAN: Well,
application versus website &mdash;

978
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,210
it's the same thing I
mentioned earlier.

979
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,060
I feel like the offline
technologies are really good

980
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,410
for building an app, like
the Lanyard thing.

981
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,530
But they don't really map very
well towards a Twitter or even

982
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,490
a Wikipedia kind of example.

983
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,140
They just don't feel like a very
good fit for something

984
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,840
where you're always pulling
in new data, and it's an

985
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,990
unbounded amount of content
that you might

986
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,300
want to pull in.

987
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,270
JAKE ARCHIBALD: If you're
just looking to improve

988
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,860
performance, that's what
the HTTP cache is for.

989
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,740
The application cache is for
caching applications &mdash;

990
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,630
it's for making it
work offline.

991
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,160
If you can get a performance
benefit out of using it, then

992
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,800
fair enough.

993
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,822
But you are buying into making
an offline-first experience.

994
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:31,960
ALEX RUSSELL: To be clear,
though, the new proposal would

995
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,720
be a reasonable accelerator.

996
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,870
If you don't ever handle any
navigation events but only

997
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:40,130
resources, you could certainly
build a local high performance

998
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,260
cache system to improve website
performance without

999
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,240
biting off any offline
capability at all.

1000
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,680
ANDREW BETTIS: In what situation
would you want to do

1001
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,790
that versus using
the HTTP cache?

1002
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,410
ALEX RUSSELL: We've had good
input from the folks at

1003
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,610
Facebook that this is their core
use case for AppCache, is

1004
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,015
actually making things &mdash;

1005
00:42:59,015 --> 00:42:59,880
or not a core.

1006
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,430
One of their most important use
cases was making things

1007
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,090
available faster.

1008
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:10,570
And at Google, I know that our
global teams have had similar

1009
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,660
needs, and AppCache
hasn't met them.

1010
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,505
So hopefully this new API
will meet those two.

1011
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:18,610
JONAS SICKING: Yeah, I think the
mental model that I've had

1012
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:23,340
recently is that it would be
great if we can make it work

1013
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,640
so that the online case
is very similar

1014
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
to the offline case.

1015
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,830
It's more a difference between
are you seeing controller

1016
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,710
slash app cache or you're not.

1017
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,950
So if we can make it so that
when you are using these new

1018
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,710
features for enabling offline
but you happen to be online,

1019
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:49,310
you can still download the data
and just download the

1020
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,300
data part and not the template
and the static content and use

1021
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,160
that cached version of that
increase performance.

1022
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,040
I'm definitely hoping that that
is a model we can get to,

1023
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,770
to basically make the online
application experience be more

1024
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,740
competitive with native &mdash;
where on native you're

1025
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,220
downloading your shell once.

1026
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,610
And then as you're using it,
you're just downloading the

1027
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,140
incremental data.

1028
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,920
We should be able to make the
same thing possible on the web

1029
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,170
to increase performance.

1030
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,220

1031
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So the HTTP
cache is like this really busy

1032
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,700
room, and everyone's in there.

1033
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,840
And the browser's having to be
the bouncer at the door.

1034
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,430
And when other people want into
the room, the bouncer's

1035
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:34,020
going, look, you've had
too much to drink.

1036
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,220
You should get out.

1037
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,670
And then what Facebook have done
is gone, ah, but there's

1038
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,580
this quieter bar around
the corner.

1039
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,160
We're going to go there.

1040
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,920
But the thing is, if everyone
starts doing that, then that

1041
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
bar is going to have to hire a
bouncer, and they're going to

1042
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,000
start kicking people
out as well.

1043
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,260
It seems like a nice performance
enhancement now.

1044
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,922
But I think if everyone started
using it, we're going

1045
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:56,180
to get the same issues where if
everyone's stuffing fonts

1046
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,080
and images into local storage,
there's going to have to be a

1047
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,630
bouncer there that kicks
people out &mdash; unless the

1048
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,190
website asked for a
permanent cache.

1049
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,030
But I don't think we want a
web where you just visit

1050
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,570
Facebook because you want to
look at a thing, and it's

1051
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,370
saying, Facebook wants to
install 5 megabytes worth of

1052
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,330
stuff just so you can see it.

1053
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,630
It's not for an offline
experience, it's just to look

1054
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,710
at the site.

1055
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,750
MARK CHRISTIAN: The interesting
characteristic

1056
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,330
about using AppCache for storing
the outer shell is

1057
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,640
that it lets you have a cache
where it's totally happy to

1058
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,680
start rendering the page with
the old version, without even

1059
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,140
going to see if there's
a new one.

1060
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,890
And that's something that HTTP
caching could theoretically be

1061
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:33,150
modified to have but doesn't.

1062
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,740
And it's an interesting
characteristic all its own.

1063
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,750
HTTP caching in general is best
described as bewildering.

1064
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,940
There's just so many options,
and it never quite does what

1065
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,910
you expect.

1066
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,340
And with all of AppCache's
problems, one thing that we

1067
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,790
can say is at least we can
expect that the data will be

1068
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,394
there when we ask
for it again.

1069
00:45:49,394 --> 00:45:54,010

1070
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,510
JONAS SICKING: I don't think the
bar around the corner is

1071
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,350
necessarily going to get
as packed as the

1072
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:01,210
initial HTTP cache bar.

1073
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:05,770
Because if we are good enough
at building the heuristics

1074
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,470
where maybe we don't download
AppCache the first time you

1075
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,250
visit a website.

1076
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:13,000
But if we see that you visit a
website every day, then we'll

1077
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,260
download the AppCache and we'll
keep it more tightly.

1078
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,820
So I think if we're more clever
than we are with HTTP

1079
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,840
cache, then I think we
can keep the good

1080
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,950
people in that bar.

1081
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,110
ANDREW BETTIS: Why do we need
another bar at all?

1082
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,800
Just hypothetically, why do we
not just have an extra cache

1083
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,450
control directive that gives
enhanced persistence within

1084
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,970
the HTTP cache?

1085
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,735
ALEX RUSSELL: I try to rephrase
this as, why is there

1086
00:46:38,735 --> 00:46:39,985
no priority system?

1087
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:42,630
Why is their no user expressible
and collaborative

1088
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,770
priority system?

1089
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,730
So many of the cases where we
wind up fighting the browser

1090
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,590
as developers are cases where if
we could express our intent

1091
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,120
more clearly to the browser, the
browser could collaborate

1092
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,150
with the user to have
a better experience

1093
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,010
provided in many cases.

1094
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:00,180
We could then use the browser
to help express to the user,

1095
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,850
hey, this is what we're
trying to do here.

1096
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:05,460
And if you say to the browser,
listen, these resources are

1097
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,720
really dear to me, these are
slightly less dear, and these

1098
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,800
are totally ephemeral, I don't
really need them &mdash;

1099
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:19,160
the work that the folks are
doing on Quota API for the

1100
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,370
file system points in this
direction, where you're

1101
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:24,300
getting to a point where you can
start to collaborate with

1102
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,300
the system and say listen, these
are really important to

1103
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,515
me, these are less important.

1104
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:30,190
And I don't think we need to
back ourselves into hard

1105
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,780
guarantees, as long as we're
able to say that, by default,

1106
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,910
you're in the less privileged
group until you ask for a

1107
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,600
privilege, in which case you
take on responsibility to

1108
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,840
collaborate.

1109
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,690
You might be evicted.

1110
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,520
You might get events about
whether or not eviction is

1111
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,620
about to happen, and maybe you
should offer up some other

1112
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,050
thing to remove or try to remove
stuff for yourself.

1113
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,430
This is a well-worn path in
a lot of other operating

1114
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:55,330
systems, where you'll say,
hey, dear plug-in or dear

1115
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,240
application, we're running
low on storage.

1116
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,010
Can you please clean
some stuff up?

1117
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,570
Or where the OS tries to clean
things up for you if it winds

1118
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:03,710
up under pressure.

1119
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,250
At that point, you have to
have a conversation.

1120
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,480
And today we have no way to
have that conversation.

1121
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,620
So it's not that we necessarily
need a different

1122
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,420
bar or a different bouncer, but
I think those are just one

1123
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,070
way of saying we need multiple
levels of collaboration and

1124
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,520
cooperation, and we don't have
any of that right now.

1125
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,900
MARK CHRISTIAN: This goes to the
philosophical web idea of

1126
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,070
the user agent knows best.

1127
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,110
Even when we talk about some
of the new ideas, there's

1128
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,960
these heuristics on caching.

1129
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,780
And we've never really decided
to empower the app developer

1130
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,240
to have much of a say in this.

1131
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,145
ALEX RUSSELL: Well,
let's be clear.

1132
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:33,640
The user agent is in control.

1133
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,930
It may not know best, but it's
certainly in control, because

1134
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:38,400
we're putting users in control
of their system and their

1135
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,150
experience.

1136
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:44,250
So the imperative for the user
agent to have the last say is

1137
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,980
all about giving users
the last say.

1138
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,660
And so that's an inviolable
principle of a safe web.

1139
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,210
The answer was, well, shouldn't
we just count on

1140
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,030
everyone being nice?

1141
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,992
And the answer is,
no, advertisers.

1142
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:57,770
Duh.

1143
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,520
MARK CHRISTIAN: It's still a
very different model than

1144
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,500
native apps, though.

1145
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,940
And I'm not saying it's a
bad model, but it's just

1146
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,040
interesting that native apps
don't have the same set of

1147
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,700
constraints on them.

1148
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,500
Once they're on the app, then
they can do all of these

1149
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,510
things within the sandbox.

1150
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,520
And in general, the sandbox that
you'll get on a native

1151
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,030
platform is very much wider than
the sandbox that you'll

1152
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:16,830
get as a random website.

1153
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,240
JONAS SICKING: Yeah, but there's
still a very big

1154
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,770
difference from a random website
and a native app.

1155
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:25,630
Within a native app, the user
has made a decision that I

1156
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:30,410
care about this app, at the very
least enough to bother

1157
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,300
with download time.

1158
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,220
But it's even more to the point
that the user has said,

1159
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,560
I trust this website to
do a lot of things.

1160
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,640
Most native apps can take
over your system.

1161
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,970
So the user has clearly
indicated that there's some

1162
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:46,460
amount of trust.

1163
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,560
And so we can't really ever give
the random website that

1164
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,390
the user's visiting the first
time the same amount of trust

1165
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,830
as a native app has.

1166
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,570
But this is where I think this
smooth transition from going

1167
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,790
from untrusted to trusted
needs to happen.

1168
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,380
ANDREW BETTIS: Is it ever
reasonable that you could

1169
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,410
visit a random website and it
could prompt you saying, this

1170
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,350
website wants to completely take
over your computer, do

1171
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:08,360
you want to allow this?

1172
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,880
ALEX RUSSELL: Sure, we
have that today.

1173
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,370
JONAS SICKING: I don't think we
should have the question to

1174
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:19,450
the user, click the yes button
if you want your system

1175
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,340
entirely taken over, click
the no button if not.

1176
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,520
Because some people will click
the yes button not knowing

1177
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,010
what their doing.

1178
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:28,520
So we need to be more
careful than that.

1179
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,840
ALEX RUSSELL: I like to think
about this as what are you

1180
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,050
getting back for friction?

1181
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:35,350
So in native apps, there's
much more friction to

1182
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:37,120
discovery and use.

1183
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,360
I have to know that I want it
or be told that I want it or

1184
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,120
be advertised to as something I
should want and then go buy

1185
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,140
it off the friction of
finding this thing.

1186
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,370
Whereas the web has this amazing
model where there's a

1187
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:52,490
zero friction to navigate
and use a new thing.

1188
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,590
Identity is a problem.

1189
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,920
We've got a lot of other things
which add incidental

1190
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,700
friction over time, but
generally speaking, we have

1191
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,020
paid application developers back
1,000 fold for putting

1192
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,480
something on the web by reducing
the friction to using

1193
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,090
to almost nothing.

1194
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:09,310
And native app models induce
this friction.

1195
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,850
And I think that Jonas is
entirely correct that that

1196
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,620
smooth transition needs to get
you to a point where in order

1197
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,520
to get the same capabilities
that you would give to a

1198
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,560
native app, you have to have
the same level of friction.

1199
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,020
Because the constraints that you
impose at those points are

1200
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,010
reasonable, and both sets of
system authors have made

1201
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,810
choices about which constraints
are going to

1202
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:34,190
impose at each level of friction
under all the same

1203
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,070
considerations.

1204
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:38,990
They're saying, if you browse to
an ephemeral web page, then

1205
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,120
you get whatever level
of effort you put

1206
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,220
into browsing there.

1207
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,630
And if you install something,
you get maybe more privilege

1208
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,970
and more process available
to you.

1209
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,360
And I think that's
the right model.

1210
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,210
And so yeah, I think that's
going to be the endpoint, is

1211
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,760
well, it will have that
much friction.

1212
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,820
And having that much friction
will get you that much.

1213
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:56,850
MARK CHRISTIAN: The smooth
gradient's a really

1214
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:57,660
interesting model.

1215
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,620
But I just think that as we're
designing new APIs, we should

1216
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,780
make sure that we actually try
to figure out, what does that

1217
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,750
smooth gradient look like?

1218
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,980
And how can we make the APIs
flexible enough to have a

1219
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,210
difference between it's either
working completely or it

1220
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,010
doesn't work at all?

1221
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,840
ANDREW BETTIS: I think we should
probably move on and

1222
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,190
talk about what we can do today
rather than what we

1223
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:16,990
should be doing tomorrow.

1224
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:22,030
So one of the most popular
questions we have is &mdash;

1225
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,730
a lot of people are stuffing
fonts, images, and JavaScript

1226
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:26,660
in local storage for
fasting loading.

1227
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:31,590
Should we be discouraging
this, which is something

1228
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,160
[INAUDIBLE]

1229
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,460
was saying at [INAUDIBLE]

1230
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,810
and us as well.

1231
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:38,340
So what would you say
to that, Alex?

1232
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,400
ALEX RUSSELL: Is it
working for you?

1233
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,410
If so, go for it.

1234
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,750
I mean, I come from a dirty
JavaScript hacker background.

1235
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,170
Man, if it works, run.

1236
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,100
Run with it as far as it goes.

1237
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:48,590
But measure.

1238
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,390
Measure, measure, measure.

1239
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:52,030
If it's actually faster,
heck yes.

1240
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:52,890
Make the web faster.

1241
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,600
Go, do it.

1242
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,020
ANDREW BETTIS: So do we need
to be aware of what pain

1243
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,620
that's storing up for
us in the future?

1244
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,850
And how much pain is that
storing up for us in future?

1245
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,280
ALEX RUSSELL: A lot.

1246
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,490
So let me tell you
all about it.

1247
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:11,630
So you'll notice if you're
stuffing a lot of stuff into

1248
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,960
local storage that you'll see
some really strange behavioral

1249
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,110
differences between IE9 and 10,
and Firefox and Chrome,

1250
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:23,100
with regards to potentially
getting out of sync across

1251
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,050
tabs or across Windows with
regards to try to communicate

1252
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,120
over a local storage.

1253
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,300
Well, why is that?

1254
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,460
Local storage is a
synchronous API.

1255
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,510
This is generally speaking in
terms of web API design a

1256
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,960
terrible, terrible thing.

1257
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,010
This is a bad thing.

1258
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:39,450
It's the reason that IndexDB
is coming along &mdash;

1259
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,790
which is available, I think, in
IE10 and it's available in

1260
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,187
Chrome and it's coming along
in other places, too.

1261
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Another
terrible, terrible thing.

1262
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:45,660
ALEX RUSSELL: I know.

1263
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,230
It's harder to use, right?

1264
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,310
So that was the pain.

1265
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:55,190
So that pain generated this new
system which isn't widely

1266
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,860
enough deployed yet.

1267
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:02,090
And so folks find out that
there's an implicit cross tab

1268
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:05,765
synchronization issue with local
storage because the API

1269
00:54:05,765 --> 00:54:07,890
is synchronous for all the tabs
that can see the same

1270
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:08,740
local store.

1271
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,730
This isn't great.

1272
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,010
This is actually relatively
terrible.

1273
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,920
So we need an asynchronous
version of local storage.

1274
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,720
So one of these you're biting
off is a huge performance

1275
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,420
issue because you'll start
loading your web page, you'll

1276
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,900
ask local storage early in the
document load to go grab you

1277
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,770
some resource, and you
think it's fast.

1278
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,040
Except we're brand
new to this.

1279
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,630
We might have put this in a
SQLite database on a per local

1280
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,540
store or per origin basis.

1281
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,350
We have to go do synchronize IO
to go load that database,

1282
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,790
block that web page, by the way,
while we're doing this,

1283
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:38,250
block the main thread, go do a
bunch of IO, and then give you

1284
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,780
the answer.

1285
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,040
This is terrible for
performance.

1286
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,910
ANDREW BETTIS: OK, so I get it.

1287
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:42,195
I get it.

1288
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:42,690
It's painful.

1289
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:46,030
So should we just not do it
and wait for this amazing

1290
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,450
navigation controller
to appear?

1291
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,590
ALEX RUSSELL: No, you
should measure.

1292
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,920
You should measure,
measure, measure.

1293
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,950
And once you've measured, you'll
have an answer about

1294
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,960
whether or not it's
better or worse.

1295
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,210
But you won't until
you measure.

1296
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,550

1297
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,390
JONAS SICKING: So I
think there's two

1298
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,430
separate questions here.

1299
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:05,010
Taking resources and storing
them locally on the client

1300
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,790
side, I think, it's a good
workaround to do until we get

1301
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:14,990
things like this controller
thing, until we fix AppCache,

1302
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,800
until we get other mechanisms in
place that actually make it

1303
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,610
a pleasurable experience to
develop these solutions.

1304
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:25,970

1305
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:30,850
So the local storage issue of
being asynchronous API &mdash;

1306
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,840
please to measure it, but it's
actually really, really hard

1307
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,230
to measure.

1308
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:39,030
The problem is that what a lot
of asynchronous IO, which A,

1309
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,320
is very, very dependent
on a device.

1310
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,460
You can't measure it locally.

1311
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,700
You need to measure it on
your users' devices.

1312
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:51,850
The other problem is that it's
not a performance hit that

1313
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,100
happens every time you
use local storage.

1314
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,650
It happens probably the
first time you see it.

1315
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,370
And even just like calling &mdash;

1316
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,270
we've had some benchmarks that
the first thing it does, it

1317
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,480
calls localStorage.clear
and then it

1318
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,875
starts using local storage.

1319
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:07,020
But at the time you called the
localStorage.clear, that's

1320
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,920
actually when the performance
hit happens.

1321
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,030
Local storage, I would say,
is hard enough to measure

1322
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,970
performance of that
you probably

1323
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:13,940
will not get it right.

1324
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:18,540
What we're doing in Firefox at
22, 21 or something is we're

1325
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,880
actually going to pre-load local
storage before we're

1326
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,310
even running scripts.

1327
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,790
So that performance hit
is not something

1328
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,410
you can't even measure.

1329
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,320
And the reason we're doing that
is because hopefully in

1330
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,800
those cases, we can do this
IO before we're even

1331
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,200
attempting to use it.

1332
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,130
It does have the effect that
we're going to do more IO for

1333
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:43,330
each and every page on your
website as soon as you use

1334
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,540
local storage.

1335
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:49,860
But that's to avoid halting
the thread and having your

1336
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,700
site look up while you're
doing this IO.

1337
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,890
So local storage's performance
is really, really tricky.

1338
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:00,350
So IndexDB has issues.

1339
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,040
Those are, in big
part, my fault.

1340
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,130
I'm one of the editors
for that spec.

1341
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,650
We do need something like
asynchronous local storage,

1342
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,520
which is as simple as local
storage but doesn't have the

1343
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,190
synchronous problem.

1344
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:15,480
So that hopefully
will come soon.

1345
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,600
ALEX RUSSELL: I'm hoping
for that, too.

1346
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,260
ANDREW BETTIS: OK, so in the
meantime, do you think that

1347
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:28,380
the fact that developers love
local storage and don't like

1348
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,730
APIs like IndexDB is an
indication that we need to

1349
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:39,035
simplify IndexDB and Web SQL
and those sort of APIs?

1350
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:40,010
ALEX RUSSELL: Yes, absolutely.

1351
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,800
So one of the things that I've
been working on over the last

1352
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,540
couple of months is to add
a futures primitive.

1353
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,740
So you might have promises
in your libraries.

1354
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,980
We're just going to ignore the
fight over what it means to

1355
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,530
have a promise.

1356
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,490
We're going to call
it a future.

1357
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:53,410
It's a different thing.

1358
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,160
Same API.

1359
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,010
.then, and then you can add
whatever callbacks you want to

1360
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,520
success and failure,
accept or reject.

1361
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,060
OK, cool.

1362
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,010
So we're building a spec for
futures for DOM, so we can

1363
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,460
start to reinterpret a lot of
these asynchronous things in a

1364
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,490
more unified way.

1365
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,760
Because events aren't really the
right model for something

1366
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,170
that is a single request.

1367
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:14,390
If I get one thing out of local
storage, I'm only asking

1368
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,040
for one thing back.

1369
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,940
I'm not asking for a potential
stream of things to happen

1370
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,750
zero or more times in
the future, which

1371
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:20,540
is the event model.

1372
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:25,370
So I have hope that we'll be
able to build a saner version

1373
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:28,090
of a lot of these APIs to stop
using events and stop using

1374
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:32,810
implicit asynchronicity and end
of term behavior and make

1375
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:36,440
it much more explicit in the
APIs, do an asynchronous local

1376
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,820
storage on top of something like
this, and then Web Crypto

1377
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:45,700
and IndexDB, I think all these
APIs can be retrofitted with

1378
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,240
this model so that we get a
much more rational API.

1379
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,620
I think a lot of this is down to
the APIs not really having

1380
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,090
great idioms baked into them.

1381
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:55,330
And it's one of these
traditional DOM versus the

1382
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:58,000
rest of the JavaScript world
discussions, which I'm happy

1383
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,440
to talk to you about over
beer endlessly.

1384
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,840
ANDREW BETTIS: So how long
until we get navigation

1385
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,090
controller?

1386
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:07,510

1387
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,770
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm not taking
responsibility for that.

1388
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:14,510
JONAS SICKING: So the space of
fixing the AppCache where

1389
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:19,770
navigation controller is a very
interesting proposal is

1390
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:24,200
something that for some reason
we had a very, very hard time

1391
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,940
actually getting to the point
of having proposals.

1392
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,810
I would say we've been working
on this for well over a year

1393
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:33,390
and a half, probably two years,
on just people ranting

1394
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,820
about how much AppCache
sucks, but there has

1395
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:36,870
not been any proposals.

1396
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,180
There are now two proposals.

1397
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,700
There's the controller thing.

1398
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,760
Mozilla also has a proposal that
we're hopefully going to

1399
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,660
present very soon.

1400
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,930
And I think that's an enormously
good first step.

1401
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:52,550
What we need to do once we have
these proposals is to get

1402
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,370
feedback from everyone
that has been

1403
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,620
complaining about AppCache.

1404
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,180

1405
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,810
The two proposals are actually
very complementary, so they

1406
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,980
actually combine very well.

1407
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,530
If you had these two
things, would

1408
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:07,930
that solve your problems?

1409
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:11,670
Or would this just be
a less sucky way?

1410
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:15,080
So we have a very
good first step.

1411
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,930
It will take a little bit to
get this stuff implemented,

1412
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:22,530
but I think it'll take a lot
less than the well over a year

1413
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:26,050
that we've been complaining
about AppCache.

1414
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:29,470
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So on the
simple APIs, do we build

1415
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:32,060
something really low level and
maybe a bit more complicated

1416
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,475
to deal with, or do
we just try and go

1417
01:00:33,475 --> 01:00:35,660
as simple as possible?

1418
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,850
We want something as simple
as possible, but look what

1419
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:39,950
happened to AppCache.

1420
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,440
They made something that was
really, really simple, but

1421
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,830
they didn't know what people
really wanted to do with it,

1422
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:46,295
so they made some things
simple and useless.

1423
01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:48,980

1424
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,847
Whereas with local storage, that
was the simple and easy

1425
01:00:52,847 --> 01:00:55,290
to use but had massive
performance problems.

1426
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:58,150
So I like the world where you
might have something like

1427
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:01,130
IndexDB, where it's what you can
do with it &mdash; there's loads

1428
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,090
you can do with it &mdash;

1429
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,000
but then have a look at what
the use cases are.

1430
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,570
See what code you see people
repeating over and over.

1431
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,790
What are people using libraries
for, and how can we

1432
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,910
get that into the problem?

1433
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,730
You see that happening
with the DOM now.

1434
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:13,960
querySelectorAll was one
of those things.

1435
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,010
We see jQuery doing it.

1436
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:17,930
We can make jQuery faster by
having that on the platform,

1437
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:20,370
and people maybe wouldn't
have to use jQuery

1438
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,570
if that's the case.

1439
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:24,580
So that's what I see going
with the navigation

1440
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,290
controller.

1441
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:28,920
Some of the code that I showed
on there was stuff I made up.

1442
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,460
There was a routing function,
which is something that

1443
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,800
probably won't be there in the
initial spec, but it's

1444
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,420
something you can create
yourself or something a

1445
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,380
library can give you.

1446
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:43,110
And we'll be able to see what
people are doing and if

1447
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:45,950
there's common patterns or a lot
of repeated code, then we

1448
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,150
can put that in the platform and
make it quicker and make

1449
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,406
it less typing.

1450
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,600
MARK CHRISTIAN: Yeah, we can
trust that libraries will come

1451
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:52,790
into existence.

1452
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:54,920
It's something that we can
rely on on the web.

1453
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,310
So we should build for
flexibility instead of stupid

1454
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:00,600
simplicity.

1455
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,760
ANDREW BETTIS: Well,
we're out of time.

1456
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,000
So thanks, everyone.

1457
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,900
And that's the end
of the panel.

1458
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:10,500
[APPLAUSE]

1459
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,233
