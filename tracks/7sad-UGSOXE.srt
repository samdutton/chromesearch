00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040

00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,740
Hi, welcome to the WebGL
debugging screencast. In this

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,400
screencast, I'm going to go
through the basics of

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,900
debugging your WebGL
applications.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,010
To get started, I have here the
Khronos WebGL wiki page

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,580
about debugging.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,105
This is a nice source
of links.

8
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:26,270
It links you to WebGL Inspector,
which is nice for

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,320
WebGL debugging.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,950
It also has a link to the WebGL
debug scripts, which is

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,400
a little piece of JavaScript
that gives you tools to debug

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,500
your WebGL applications.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,010
In particular, it has got a
WebGL debug context, which is

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:55,930
a special wrapper for a WebGL
context that makes all GL

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,990
errors show up in the
JavaScript console.

16
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:06,290
So you can also customize
it to do

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,110
JavaScript style error handling.

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:14,120
So that instead of getting back
an error number, you can

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,250
make it actually throw an
exception when you get an

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,330
error on a GL call.

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,740
And what the debug context does
is after each call to GL,

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,570
it calls gl.geterror to
get the error code.

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:37,200
This causes a performance
penalty if you use it in your

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,060
production code.

25
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,045
But for debugging, it's great.

26
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:43,550

27
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,290
It also has this little
function,

28
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,915
WebGLDebugUtils.glEnumToString,
which lets you take one of

29
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:58,980
those cryptic error codes and
gets the name for the error.

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,230
Very useful.

31
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,990

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,420
Next, I'm going to show you
the WebGL Inspector.

33
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,610
So the WebGL Inspector
is a little Chrome

34
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,380
extension by Ben Vanik.

35
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,750
And it's probably easier to
show you what it does.

36
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,390
So it is on GetHub,
benvanik.gethub.

37
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,640
com/WebGL-Inspector.

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,740

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,220
I'm going to show you the live
demo of the WebGL Inspector.

40
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,430
So here we have a WebGL demo
running on the screen.

41
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,430
And click on the UI button, we
get the WebGL Inspector.

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,200
And now I'm going to go through

43
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,720
some of the easy features.

44
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:58,800
So Programs tab, you have got
the shaders and the GL

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,530
programs. And these have the
uniforms, the attributes, the

46
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,970
shader sources, the status
for the shaders.

47
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,480
So if you've got problems
with your shaders,

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,610
you can see it here.

49
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,770
Then there's a Buffers pane,
which shows you all the

50
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,092
buffers used in your
WebGL program.

51
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:28,750
And here you can see what is
inside of buffer, what is the

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:35,980
size of the buffer, and
what has been done

53
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,430
to the buffer recently.

54
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,610
If we look up &mdash;

55
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,380
I think it's this one.

56
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:49,160
Yeah, here we have
an 89k buffer.

57
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,180
And here is a 600k buffer.

58
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,070
And with these, you don't see
the buffer contents directly.

59
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,770
But you have to click on this
link to show them, which I'm

60
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,230
not going to click, because I
think it's going to crash the

61
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,900
browser if I do that.

62
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,716

63
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,410
I'll do that anyway.

64
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,740
Let's see what happens.

65
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,570
Yeah.

66
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,700
OK, well, that was surprisingly
fast. So 89k

67
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,870
buffer, perfectly OK.

68
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,120
No problem.

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,130

70
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,040
You also have a Textures pane
that shows you all the

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,900
textures in your WebGL
application, texture settings

72
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,550
and what has been done
to the texture.

73
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,190
And in the Textures pane, you
can see all the textures in

74
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,830
your WebGL program.

75
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,250
And you can see the texture
parameters for each texture

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,170
and the texture content.

77
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:59,090
Because this is a texture that
was passed as a null texture &mdash;

78
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,460
that is it is a GPU site texture
that the WebGL program

79
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,610
is editing in the GPU &mdash;

80
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,430
we don't see anything in
the texture contents.

81
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,780
This is one problem with WebGL
Inspector at the moment which

82
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,186
I think could be fixed.

83
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,910

84
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,950
But if you have a normal
texture, you should see the

85
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,210
contents of the texture A-OK.

86
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,000

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
In the State panel, you get a
state snapshot of the current

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
WebGL context state.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,660
It has all the blending and
the blend colors, color

90
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,563
values, maximum attributes
and such like.

91
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,710

92
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,490
In the Timeline pane, you can
see what's happening in your

93
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,160
WebGL program.

94
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,480
The timeline view shows you what
you are doing with WebGL.

95
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,080
So it shows you how much time
it takes per frame to render

96
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,230
your WebGL scene.

97
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,670
And it shows you how many
textures you are allocating,

98
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,244
how many programs you are
using, and so on.

99
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,350
Now If we go the Trace panel &mdash;

100
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,010
this is the first panel, but
I'm taking the class.

101
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,660
So the Trace panel is the last
panel that I'm going to go to.

102
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,610
And when I click on the Capture
button, what I get

103
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,350
here is what happened
during this frame.

104
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:43,710
Here's the image that was drawn,
and then all the DL

105
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:50,610
calls we did to draw
that frame.

106
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,430
Very useful, very nice.

107
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,670
Let's move on.

108
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:01,550
So for Unit Testing GL, the Maps
GL team here at Google

109
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,280
built this little thing,
glsl-unit, which is a unit

110
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,530
testing framework for GLSL
code in the WebGL.

111
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,910
And &mdash;

112
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,505
testing frameworks that allows
you to write and run Unit

113
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:19,000
Tests for your WebGL
GLSL code.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,560
GLSL units will run your test
code on the graphics card and

115
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,030
extract the results.

116
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,910
So it will be identical to the
execution environment of your

117
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,170
shader coding production.

118
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,850
And that is the great thing
about GLSL units.

119
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,110

120
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,080
If you want to hear more about
GLSL units and how the Maps

121
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:47,240
team was developing WebGL, you
can go to this YouTube talk

122
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,460
from GTAC 2011.

123
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,680
It's Developing and
Testing WebGL.

124
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,690
It's by Roy Williams, one
of the MapsGL engineers.

125
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:05,540
And GTAC stands for Google Test
Automation Conference.

126
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,750
And this is a great talk for
real-life WebGL use in a

127
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,950
non-game setting.

128
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,240
So go there and check it out.

129
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,650
This is about all I have
to say about WebGL

130
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,840
debugging for now.

131
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,110
So thanks for watching
and get hacking.

132
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,767
