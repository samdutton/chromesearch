00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,690

2
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,970
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, guys.

3
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,710
You don't know the amount of
trouble that we've had trying

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,450
to get this ready.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,870
I'm here with one of
my friends and

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,510
colleagues, Ian Barber.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,920
So I hope this is working.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,840
If not, then we're just doing
this for no reason as well.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,860
However, let's get started
properly, shall we?

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,220
My name is Paul Kinlan.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,670
I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,120
And I can't say advocate
at all properly.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,830
I'm an advocate, apparently.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,140
And I work on the Chrome Team,
and we're here to talk about

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,730
Chrome apps.

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,470
So just before Christmas, we did
a whole series, about 12

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,260
different episodes about what's
happening inside of

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,190
Chrome and Chrome applications
and all that type of stuff.

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,010
And we had a little break
over Christmas.

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,180
We came back today.

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,600
This is our very first one,
we came back today.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,770
And we've decided to show you
what's happened since

23
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,530
Christmas, I think is the
best thing to do.

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,550
When I say since Christmas, I
think to put in context, the

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,800
best thing to say is that we've
had two hackathons.

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,370
We've actually had
more than that.

27
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,720
We've had three hackathons
overall.

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,460
We had one in London, which
was, I think, October,

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,200
November time.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,520
And then we were going to plan
one in Boston and one in New

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,920
York, and one in Mountain
View as well.

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,580
But for scheduling conflicts
and some other reasons, the

33
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,660
Boston and New York hackathons
got put back.

34
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,420
But we've done them.

35
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,400
We have a whole load of
great guys come along.

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,950
Some of the people on the Chrome
Apps Community Group on

37
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,400
Google+, they came
along as well.

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,080
And we showed some really cool
stuff, and we did some really

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,420
nice things.

40
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,580
I think today is going to be
just really us showing you

41
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,340
what the community, what people
inside the Chrome Apps

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,220
Community have built.

43
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,140
So I think we should start.

44
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,840
Should we start?

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,890
I think we're good.

46
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,750
Yes, we got a nod from my
co-producer at the back.

47
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,610
So let's go from
the beginning.

48
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,230

49
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,820
Boston was our first
one, I think is the

50
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,330
easiest thing to say.

51
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,380
It was based in the
Bocoup Loft.

52
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,590
They let us host there,
and I think about

53
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,120
30 developers came.

54
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,280
It was quite cool, and we got
quite a lot of good apps.

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
I got the first one, actually.

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,995
So I basically prepared this
whole list of applications

57
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:24,370
that we're OK to talk about
a little bit more

58
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,470
publicly, at least.

59
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,190
And the first one, I can't
really show you because I

60
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,660
haven't got my credit card
ready to go and buy it.

61
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,840
But it was called Mad Dash.

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,550
Basically, it's not a horse
racing simulator, but you can

63
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,230
basically place fake
bets and see which

64
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,690
horse is going to win.

65
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,260
The interesting thing,
actually &mdash; and I'm going to

66
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,710
shift off this one a little
bit sooner than I planned,

67
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,645
because this actually
wasn't a V2 app.

68
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:49,910
So we have these two different
models at the moment.

69
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,870
We have packaged apps and
packaged apps V2.

70
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,370
We haven't got an official name
for the apps V2 just yet.

71
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,390
And the main difference is that
the original packaged

72
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,370
apps live entirely inside
the browser.

73
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,170
So they live inside
the window Chrome.

74
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,840
You probably can't see on my
desktop at the moment because

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,700
I don't think it's
being shared.

76
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,470
Now it's being shared.

77
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,600
Awesome.

78
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,480
So Mad Dash, this is the one
here, and I was showing you

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,350
the screenshots before.

80
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,620
This is Mad Dash.

81
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,110
It's actually a V1 app.

82
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,550
And the thing about V1 apps,
it's like TweetDeck.

83
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,420
TweetDeck is a V1 app
where it lives

84
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,610
entirely inside the browser.

85
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,430
So it'll live here, basically.

86
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,960
And there's actually quite a lot
of things that we learned

87
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,900
from Chrome OS, is that people
want applications.

88
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,610
They want their web
applications, but they want

89
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,200
them to live outside
the browser.

90
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,050
And this application is a V1
app, so it lives inside the

91
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,630
browser still.

92
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,340
But actually when they demoed
it, it was actually still a

93
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,960
pretty good app.

94
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,630
It was still pretty cool,
but it was a V1 app.

95
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,540
So I should close that
one, and I will show

96
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,810
you a V2 app, Trail-app.

97
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,080
So this is one of
the contestants

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,120
from the Boston hackathon.

99
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,400
And basically, if we launch the
app &mdash; we can launch from

100
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,960
the Chrome Web Store &mdash;

101
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,460
you should see the fact that
it's actually outside the

102
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,700
browser at the moment.

103
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,160
Now, it's a little bit
wobbly because I'm

104
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,060
moving it around loads.

105
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,910
But the idea is that
you can get full

106
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,030
control of the canvas.

107
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,100
You can control the entire UI
that's presented to your user.

108
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,020
And in this case, they've
chosen just to go with a

109
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,380
normal title attribute, like
a title bar, so it's like a

110
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,250
basic window without any extra
little bits on it.

111
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,959
You could launch different
types of applications.

112
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,220
You can have applications which
don't even have this

113
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,240
little white bar across the
top where you control and

114
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,210
minimize, maximize, and close,
and the ability to drag the

115
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,080
window around yourself.

116
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,630
So you could have a Drag button
right in the middle of

117
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,530
the application.

118
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,380
But essentially, this was a
thoughtbot trail maps app.

119
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,075
It was kind of cool.

120
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,340
From what I understand, they
basically ported a traditional

121
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,890
web application into the
offline kind of model.

122
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,720
And that was actually one of the
things that we found from

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,860
quite a lot of applications, a
lot of developers at least, is

124
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,770
that they quite often had a
web application that they

125
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,410
already had on the web, but they
wanted to move it into

126
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,760
this native wrapper.

127
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,790
And the thing about this native
wrapper is actually,

128
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,820
it's offline first.

129
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,890
It's offline throughout the
entirety of the application.

130
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,700
And you basically try
and integrate online

131
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,920
functionality in.

132
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,960
And the reason why we do this
is because we want our

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,880
applications to work when
the user is offline.

134
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,630
You've got a Chromebook, or
you've got your Mac or your

135
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,010
Windows machine, and you want
your application to work

136
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,010
wherever you are, regardless
of connectivity.

137
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,680
Or at least maybe not work
completely, because obviously,

138
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,120
if it's a Twitter app and you
have no internet connection,

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,395
you can't go and get
your tweets.

140
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,865
But you should be able to at
least see all the tweets that

141
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:31,330
have come back in the past.

142
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,530
You should be able to reply to
a tweet and, say, queue it to

143
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,760
be sent later on.

144
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,500
And if you're on the web, you
press Refresh or try and

145
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,800
launch a bookmark when it's
not on the web or not

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,270
connected, you're up a stream
without a paddle.

147
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,230
I have to be really careful
how I say that one.

148
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,680
But you're in not a great
situation, and that's one of

149
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,590
the big things that a lot of
people found when they tried

150
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,925
to port their applications to
this platform, at least, is

151
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:03,250
that you have to think
differently.

152
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,480
You have to think in much more
of a native app kind of

153
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,100
developer mindset, where
online functionality is

154
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,170
integrated into your app and
not offline functionality.

155
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,780
This is a nice app.

156
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,030
It's basically a tutorial.

157
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,480

158
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,950
It's kind of a code quiz, from
what I remember, that lets you

159
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,360
basically learn about different
technology,

160
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,270
understanding the fundamentals
of JavaScript.

161
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,960
And then by the end of it, you
should be able to understand

162
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,130
that you can iterate
over collections.

163
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,200
For a day's worth of work and
getting it from a complete

164
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,830
online website into an offline
packaged app is really good.

165
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,600
So that's the Trail-app.

166
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,150
We have the next one,
the VideoPlayer.

167
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,610
I'm pretty sure I'm allowed
to show this one.

168
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,370
They said yes next to it.

169
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,600
But we have the ability to play
videos, and there we are.

170
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,210
It's playing a video.

171
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,542
It's kind of cool.

172
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,526
I think we can go more
full screen.

173
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:53,764
This is the full full
screen API.

174
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:57,610
And I'm hoping that we're
allowed to show this video.

175
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,930
I'll get into trouble.

176
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,400
But the idea behind it is that
you could have a full

177
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,980
canvassed canvas
video element.

178
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,430
So this area here is just a
custom HTML5 video player.

179
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,440
It's nothing extra
and special.

180
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,290
That's all it is, right?

181
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,960
I mean, you might sit there and
go, well, what's the use?

182
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,920
Well, some of the really cool
things that you can start to

183
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,450
do with this is that you have
access to TCP and UDP sockets.

184
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,730
You could create a local
network for local media

185
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,480
servers and then pull the list
in off there via the

186
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,200
[INAUDIBLE], essentially.

187
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,420
So you can go to your Xbox Media
Center and pull in the

188
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,540
videos and play it.

189
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,415
And then once you can play it
on your desktop, or whether

190
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,580
it's your Chromebook, well, what
happens if you wanted to

191
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,360
go on an airplane?

192
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,050
Well, the really cool thing was
you could basically say,

193
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,280
well, I want to take this video
that I've got on my

194
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,170
Media Center, and then bring
it onto my Chromebook or my

195
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,770
MacBook or whatever machine that
you have, and then play

196
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,980
it when you're offline
as well.

197
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,950
So I think that's quite a
powerful demo, and to get this

198
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,560
integrated in one day
was pretty cool.

199
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,260
The things that we would like to
see off these type of demos

200
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,240
is, for me at least anyways, the
removal of this title bar

201
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,110
across the top.

202
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,060
I want it to be full canvas,
full screen video from edge to

203
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,350
edge regardless.

204
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,350
And then when you go for the
Full Screen button, is

205
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,610
actually to use the
Full Screen API.

206
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,070
That should work and you should
be able to take that

207
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,740
window and make it a proper full
screen like you'd expect

208
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,990
from a native application.

209
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,630
So that's pretty cool.

210
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,890
We have Happy Friday.

211
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,645
Now this was in Boston, I
believe, and this was actually

212
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:22,470
a really good app.

213
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,170
So basically, Happy Friday is
a game that they have been

214
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,840
working on already.

215
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,500
So it's not a brand new game
from the day, but they got it

216
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,600
to work offline.

217
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,650
And it basically is
an SVG-based &mdash;

218
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,140
I believe it was SVG &mdash;

219
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,500
SVG-powered game.

220
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,690
So we launch it.

221
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,080
Again, you can see this
nice window that's

222
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,539
not part of the browser.

223
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,070
And we have this little dude.

224
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,350
And I got confused with this.

225
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,295
It's not press Right to start,
it's actually press D. So we

226
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,560
can go through, start level.

227
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,370
Let me see if there's
any sound.

228
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,250
No audio at the moment.

229
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:53,970
Oh, there is.

230
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,120
[ELECTRONIC SOUNDS]

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,610
PAUL KINLAN: Pretty cool.

232
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,060
[SHEEP BAAS]

233
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,040
[LAUGHTER]

234
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,270
PAUL KINLAN: Did not realize
that was on.

235
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,010
Sorry, hoping the sound's on,
but there was a sheep in the

236
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,620
background.

237
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,310
But you can at least jump.

238
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,770
You can do these cool
things, collect.

239
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,850
And you know, this is the thing
that we want to try and

240
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,700
get from this platform &mdash;

241
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,810
wow, oh, he died &mdash;

242
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,190
is the ability to have games
that work offline, games that

243
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,390
you install, games that users
think are games on their

244
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,440
platform, not just these games
that live inside a full web

245
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,980
page, inside a Flash kind
of container in the

246
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,420
middle of the screen.

247
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,190
We want these games to
be immersive, right?

248
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,270
And to get this in one
day was pretty cool.

249
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,900
I'm really pleased
with this app.

250
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,790
I think this should sell it.

251
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,780
I think it's a game that you
could sell quite easily.

252
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,030
Whee!

253
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,504

254
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:48,110
It might use Box2D to actually
do all the physics, but it's

255
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,850
powered, I believe, by SVG.

256
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,232
And I think these guys won, as
well, won the best app or the

257
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:57,250
best looking app in Boston.

258
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,400
It was a really good effort
from the guys.

259
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,800
So let's have a look at the
next one, LetterBrush.

260
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,490
This was Boston as well.

261
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,500
So this one I had
no idea existed.

262
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,710
I didn't even know that this
was a thing, but basically,

263
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,940
when you're creating a 2D game,
you want these maps.

264
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,750
You want the ability to
basically construct a map so

265
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,990
you can do certain things.

266
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,480
So I press on the keyboard F
and C. And I can build a 2D

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,800
map quite quickly.

268
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,020
I can say, this is a line.

269
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,850
I'm going to go from here, and
I can build across that way,

270
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,600
and I'm going to square.

271
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,040
This is my 2D map, right?

272
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,210
That's what you want.

273
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,580
It's pretty cool.

274
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,580
Now this actually is an existing
web application.

275
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,380

276
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,180
It's not a brand new app for the
day, but what they've done

277
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,100
again is they've taken this web
application and ported it

278
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,470
into a native container.

279
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,820
And it works completely
offline.

280
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,810
I mean, you don't have to think
about App Cache and use

281
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,000
all these are other things.

282
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,380
But the really cool thing that
I like about this was that

283
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,910
they actually let you save using
the Export button and

284
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,320
then Save to File, and you could
save directly to the

285
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,110
user's desktop.

286
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,730
So that's my web server,
so that's OK.

287
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,830
So Save, done.

288
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,480
Now I believe what basically
happened in the background is

289
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,350
it basically did Auto Save
all the way through.

290
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,500
And then the thing that you
don't get on the web right now

291
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,090
is the ability to do an Auto
Save, so you can't save a file

292
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,710
and then keep a reference to
that file and then keep

293
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,760
writing and writing
and writing to it,

294
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,390
whereas you can in this.

295
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,520
And that was pretty cool.

296
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,720
I believe this might have won
one of our best apps.

297
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,850
A lot of people really liked
this application in Boston,

298
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,315
just because they took it from
a completely online app and

299
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:42,900
brought it offline.

300
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,360
Pretty cool.

301
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,200
Now this one.

302
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,680
Let me refresh this page
because it's installed.

303
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,470
This is called Chompy Ball.

304
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:58,290
I've only played it briefly
inside New York, but I watched

305
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,597
one of the developers,
and I can't remember

306
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:00,350
his name at the moment.

307
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,680
Let's see if he's got
it on there &mdash;

308
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,930
Raheel Khalid.

309
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,570
And basically, this is
a really good app.

310
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,010
Basically it's a 2D canvas.

311
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,650
The entirety of this surface
is a 2D canvas.

312
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,800
Let me just play it.

313
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,900
I like playing games, so
I'm not going to pay

314
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,480
attention to you guys.

315
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,300
Here we go.

316
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,870
And so he built this game in a
day at the New York hackathon.

317
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,230
And the entire thing
is just a canvas.

318
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,290
And it's a relatively
simple game.

319
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,610
But the really cool thing was he
actually built it with just

320
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,580
a Chromebook entirely.

321
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,450
So he didn't have
a normal PC &mdash;

322
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,620
or what we'd say a
normal PC, as a

323
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,880
Chromebook is a normal PC &mdash;

324
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,370
a traditional desktop or a
traditional laptop, right?

325
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,240
He built this thing with
just Chrome OS.

326
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,190
And the really cool thing
was he used a &mdash;

327
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,860
let me just go to
gethub.com/chromeappsamples &mdash;

328
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,090
Mini Code Edit.

329
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,720
I believe he used this
tool here, which is

330
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,970
called Mini Code Edit.

331
00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:00,330

332
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,710
Essentially, Mini Code Edit is
just a normal code editor

333
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:07,110
using the Ace Syntax highlighter
done by the guys

334
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,000
who do Cloud9, I believe,
Cloud9 IDE.

335
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,680
So he basically just used the
Ace Editor inside this Mini

336
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,920
Code Edit, could save files out
to his desktop, open them

337
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,340
back up again, and made this
entire game in one day just

338
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,310
using the Chromebook, which I
think is quite impressive.

339
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,850
There was a another guy from &mdash;

340
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,840
actually, his tab is
here, Joe Sullivan.

341
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,460
He built this thing.

342
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,870
I can't demo it today, because
I can't just get it working.

343
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,490
And I need some apps to show
it working properly.

344
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:40,650
But Joe Sullivan actually did a
whole lot of stuff around a

345
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,250
clone of the Web Intents API.

346
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,720
Because obviously,
we've removed Web

347
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,970
Intents from Chrome.

348
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,120
We have people who still want
to use basically an

349
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,790
application discovery mechanism
so that they

350
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,200
communicate between apps
without having

351
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,180
to know each other.

352
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,330
And he built this thing called
Spoke, which is an API,

353
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,730
basically, to emulate Web
Intents inside Chrome Apps.

354
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,960
And he built that in a day.

355
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,260
He actually did that using
the Chromebook as well.

356
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,000
So that was really cool.

357
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,560
I think we had two guys in New
York use Chromebooks, and one

358
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,570
guy in Boston who's
used a Chromebook.

359
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,860
But the game was particularly
impressive, Chompy Ball.

360
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,280
It was pretty cool just
for that one day.

361
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,000
And finally, I can't remember
the guy's name now, but he

362
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,130
actually did two apps.

363
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,430
And he's only listed one
of them at the moment.

364
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,530
But Paycheck Calculator
was pretty cool.

365
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,170
And again, this was, he
says, pretty much a

366
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,440
ripoff of this one.

367
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,350
It's kind of cool.

368
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,260
But the thing about this, it's
a simple app for working out

369
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,180
basically tips and keeping
track, in a more textual

370
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,152
format, of expenses.

371
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,290
And we had to do some things.

372
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,730
The interesting thing
about this was &mdash;

373
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,966
we'll launch it first &mdash;

374
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:57,910
dinner for 12 at $12, maybe, and
then I bought an Android

375
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:05,070
Nexus 4 for $250.

376
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,310
I don't know the price.

377
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,110
Multiplying by four &mdash;

378
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,800
Nexus 4.

379
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,910
I've done something wrong.

380
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,730
My demos are failing.

381
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,030
There we are.

382
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,410
Basically, he actually
explained some of the

383
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,080
algorithm of this.

384
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,360
It basically picks the numbers
up and then tries to work out

385
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,860
whether you should multiply.

386
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,130
You might say, well, I gave
the clerk a 10% tip.

387
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,110
So yeah, it's worked out.

388
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,260
26.2 is the tip that
you should do.

389
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,390
Now, I thought that
was pretty cool.

390
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,660
I thought it was a
pretty nice app.

391
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,800
You got it working in a day.

392
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,850
Interestingly, we had a lot of
problems with this because as

393
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,770
you've seen, if we type text
in, see the thing?

394
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,450
A lot of it kind of
expands and moves

395
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,930
about the actual surface.

396
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,300
Well, this didn't work at all.

397
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,800
So this is like a content
editable area.

398
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,630
And the very first time that you
start this application, it

399
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,770
starts out with this.

400
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,770
We had two problems, actually.

401
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,300
First, we couldn't
select any text.

402
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,240
We couldn't actually start
typing in, because it's a

403
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,270
content editable div &mdash;

404
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,940
it's a pre or a div.

405
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,130
But it's not a text area.

406
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,870
It's just something that's
content editable.

407
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,950
And content editable itself
doesn't accept user clicks.

408
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,440
So the thing about apps is that
you can't select stuff

409
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,080
all the time.

410
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,900
This is the thing you see about
the web at the moment.

411
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,170
You're in Gmail, and you double
click on something

412
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,260
that's not quite the actual
email document, it might be a

413
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,880
part of a button, and then all
of a sudden, the entire user

414
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,670
interface is selected.

415
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,490
So what we've done with apps
is we've inverted the

416
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,940
selection model so only text
boxes and text input areas and

417
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,470
places like that, where you
expect to actually input text,

418
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,540
are things that will actually
start to receive text input.

419
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,510
It sounds a little bit silly,
but that's what's happened.

420
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:54,170
So content editable items aren't
in the actual style

421
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,520
sheet to have the ability
to actually do

422
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,130
user selectable text.

423
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,000
But that wasn't too bad.

424
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,810
We fixed that.

425
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,850
It's just a CSS attribute,
WebKit Text

426
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,310
Select, I think it is.

427
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,400
And then you can start
to type stuff in.

428
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,250
And I think the other
interesting thing about this

429
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,599
was we have &mdash;

430
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,730
I think it's a bug, but
it might not be.

431
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,339
We have this issue where you
might set your window to 500

432
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,990
pixels by 500 pixels, however,
the HTML element is 0 by 0,

433
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,400
until you start filling it with
content, so that actually

434
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,170
wraps the content rather
than fills the window.

435
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,340
So you have to basically put a
CSS attribute on your HTML

436
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,710
element and your body element if
you want it to also fill to

437
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,060
be width 100%, height 100%.

438
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,440
And sometimes you can also put
Position Absolute, and that

439
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,010
kind of fixes it.

440
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,250
One big bit of feedback that
we did get, and let me just

441
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,130
see if I can test this.

442
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,970
See that?

443
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,520
This is kind of interesting,
is that

444
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,270
there's no scroll bars.

445
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,480
Now, we need feedback from you
guys as developers to actually

446
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,130
say whether we should have
overflow auto straight on this

447
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,660
thing, or whether you
want to control

448
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,320
that yourself manually.

449
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,100
I think it's a little bit
of a user nightmare.

450
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,510
I can't scroll back up.

451
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,690
You can get around if you just
put overflow call on Scroll X,

452
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,170
or Overflow X Scroll, for
instance, or Overflow Y

453
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,510
Scroll, and then you can get
the scroll bars back on.

454
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,260
But we need to know from you
guys whether you should

455
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,490
actually have this as a default

456
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,120
feature inside the platform.

457
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,790
So anyway, that was the
Paycheck Calculator.

458
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,050
Let me see if he actually
put his other app in.

459
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,060
No, he didn't put his
other app in.

460
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,820
I can't see it there at least.

461
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,135
So it was a color picker, so it
let you basically just have

462
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:30,480
a color picker.

463
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,790
You expect color pickers to be
part of the web, not as a web

464
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:38,180
page, as a separate app,
and that's what it was.

465
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,840
And that was it, right?

466
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,790
So we had quite a lot of
developers come in.

467
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:45,030
I think there was 50 or 60
overall in both hackathons.

468
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,710
Obviously, some people didn't
want us to talk about and show

469
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,440
off their applications,
so we haven't done it.

470
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,740
But if we get some permission,
we'll ask the guys to come in

471
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,960
as well and show some
really cool stuff.

472
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,010
The new things that have
happened since Christmas is

473
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,110
kind of interesting.

474
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,820
We've got a couple of things
that we're going to talk about

475
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,160
over the next couple of
weeks on the Chrome

476
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,340
Apps side of things.

477
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,850
So we have rich notifications.

478
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,160
So some of you guys might have
seen a Rich Notification Panel

479
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,525
happening Chrome OS, and some
things on Google+ by a guy

480
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:18,560
called Francis who's found
some of the stuff that's

481
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,240
happened inside Chrome.

482
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,610
So we're going to show off the
Notification API, essentially.

483
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,560
The Notification API is kind of
interesting because we had

484
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,640
an HTML5 Notifications.

485
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,110
It wasn't HTML5 Notifications.

486
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,180
It was a specification that's a
SubSpec of the broader HTML5

487
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,770
specification, which is a
notification specification,

488
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,670
and it had two components.

489
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,910
We had one component, which was
Create Notification, and

490
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,040
then we had a second proprietary
one, which was

491
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,690
called HTML Notification, where
you could basically

492
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,590
create an iframe that would
appear as some part in the

493
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,220
application.

494
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,700
A lot of user agent vendors
didn't like it.

495
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,600
We liked it.

496
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,090
TweetDeck used it like crazy.

497
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,560
We liked it, but a lot of other
user agents didn't like

498
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,970
it because it didn't integrate
with the native system

499
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,270
notification providers.

500
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,430
So you're Android kind of thing
that you bring down at

501
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,780
the top, that's not HTML.

502
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,695
That's just basically strings
of some images, and likewise

503
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:12,270
with iOS as well.

504
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,940
So we've still got HTML
Notification in Chrome Apps,

505
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,590
but we're going to encourage
people to use the Rich

506
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,170
Notifications.

507
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,310
So I think Joe Marini, I
believe, is going to show you

508
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,100
that demo at some point
in the near future.

509
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,490
We also have push messaging,
which I can talk about,

510
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,125
because it's on the Docks, make
sure it's not secret.

511
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,920
But we have this idea of push
messaging, basically, where

512
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,710
you should be able to basically
send a notification

513
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,650
to a server, and then any one of
your connected applications

514
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,530
should be able to receive that
notification and display

515
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,160
something to the user.

516
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,070
So we're going to have that.

517
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,940
That's kind of interesting.

518
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,130
We're also going to talk
about alarms as well.

519
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,390
Some people tried to use alarms
at the hackathons to

520
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,110
varying degrees of success.

521
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,370
And the idea of an alarm is it's
kind of like Set Timeout

522
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:05,940
on Set Immediate where you
provide a function, tell it

523
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,420
when in the future it's going
to be called, and then the

524
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,400
system will notify your
application when it should

525
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,750
wake up and process that code.

526
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,380
The interesting thing about this
is that it's not exactly

527
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,230
like set Timeout.

528
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:22,390
Set Timeout will do one second
or a couple of milliseconds,

529
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,380
you set days, right?

530
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,010
But if your application's not
running, it'll never get

531
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,430
registered and handled
when your

532
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,560
application's not running.

533
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,700
The idea behind Set Alarm
is that in theory, your

534
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,080
application could not be
running, and because Chrome is

535
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,190
keeping track of the
registrations, you could say

536
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,060
in five days' time,
pop up this alert.

537
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:47,780
And your application code will
be brought back to life and

538
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,740
called and executed, and then
you can do something with the

539
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,530
application, maybe show a richer
notification, those

540
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,020
types of things.

541
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,370
So that's the summary
of what's happened.

542
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,700
We're going to have a lot more
things to talk about over the

543
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,810
upcoming weeks.

544
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:08,780
As always, we want you guys to
tell us what you know you want

545
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,160
to hear about, we can try
and start to talk to.

546
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,640
The best place to go and contact
everyone is either the

547
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,630
group Chrome Maps
@googlegroups.com.

548
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,840
I haven't got any placeholders
to overlay at the moment,

549
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,900
because we had such a &mdash;

550
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,960
I won't tell you how much effort
we had to do to get

551
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,380
this video working, but it
involved reinstalling a lot of

552
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,630
things in the last
two minutes.

553
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,450

554
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,900
We also have a Google+
community, which I believe is

555
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,780
called Chrome Apps
and Extensions.

556
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,210
There's about 500 people
involved there.

557
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,220
If you have any questions, any
feedback or things that you

558
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,740
want to see, either leave them
on the event post that we've

559
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,660
done, or just leave
it in that group.

560
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,300
We are pretty active
there as well.

561
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,940
We're all members of
that community.

562
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,040
It's run by an external
moderator called Bruno.

563
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,770
So yes, leave all the
feedback there.

564
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,080
And I'm not going to
say we're done.

565
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm going to jump to
some questions.

566
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,710
I know there's some things
that have come in.

567
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,210
So let me just switch to
some of these now.

568
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,300
None on the Moderator.

569
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,620
10 votes for one question
from 12 people.

570
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:11,980
Brilliant.

571
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,850
So we've got one question
in the Moderator.

572
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,470
So the question, shall
I read it out?

573
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,710
I'll read it out.

574
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,080
The question about publishing
packaged apps are still in

575
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,500
developer preview and because of
that cannot be published in

576
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,950
the Chrome Web Store.

577
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,520
Are there plans of releasing
packaged apps anytime soon?

578
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,790
From Oleg in Toronto.

579
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,890
Really great question.

580
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,370
Obviously, we never
comment on actual

581
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,030
physical launch timelines.

582
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,210
The interesting thing is that
these, you can actually put

583
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,710
applications inside the store
today, they just can't be

584
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,410
discovered.

585
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,570
So all the apps that we
showed you before &mdash;

586
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,850
let me jump through here &mdash;

587
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,580
these are actually all inside
the Web Store today.

588
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,060
Paycheck Calculator, Chompy
Ball, LetterBrush, they're all

589
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,000
inside the Chrome Web Store.

590
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,020
It's just that when you search
for LetterBrush, you won't be

591
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,930
able to find it in Search.

592
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,430
So if you want to make something
now, you can start

593
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,360
pushing it off.

594
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,140
I know one of the really big
things at the moment is you

595
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,550
want to get that discovery, and
the funnel of the Chrome

596
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,770
Web Store driving traffic
to your app.

597
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,990
Right now, it's not there.

598
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,940
You'll have to actually
basically direct

599
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,310
the user to the app.

600
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,300
It's the only thing that
we can say right now.

601
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,120
So that's the question.

602
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,200
We don't have any kind of solid
time on that I can tell

603
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,320
you right now, but we're working
on it like crazy.

604
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,092

605
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:32,260
What's this?

606
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,690
Silver onion, cool.

607
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,410
Let me just jump to see.

608
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,660
No, that'll be it, I think.

609
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,800

610
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,870
I'm going to check
one more thing.

611
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,310
I won't share my screen.

612
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,890
I have some G+ notifications.

613
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,060
Anyone asked any questions?

614
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,310
No questions.

615
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,400

616
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,650
No questions.

617
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,600

618
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,250
No questions.

619
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,830
I think we're done.

620
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,780
If you do have any questions
in the intermedium period,

621
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,480
please put them on the
group or email me,

622
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,610
paulkinlan@google.com, or
actually go on our Google

623
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,870
Group as well.

624
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,810
And with that, I thank you
very much and goodbye.

625
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:29,867
