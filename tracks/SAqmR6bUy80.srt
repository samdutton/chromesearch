00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,020
CLANCY CHILDS: Hello.

3
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,625
Thank you for attending.

4
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:07,060
In this session, we're going
to be speaking about two

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,430
Google products, Google AdSense
and Google Analytics,

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,620
which are now integrating with
Google BigQuery, Google's big

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,060
data analysis and
query engine.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,160
My name's Clancy Childs.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,220
I'm a product manager for
Google Analytics.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,593
LOUIS COLLARD: I'm
Louis Collard.

11
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm a software engineer
on AdSense.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,290
DUNCAN MCKIE: And I'm
Duncan Mckie.

13
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,540
I work for Gumtree.com.

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,980

15
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,750
CLANCY CHILDS: A key design
principle for all Google

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,370
products is to make sure that
they are easy to use by the

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,700
average user.

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,880
This means that for reporting
products, like Google

19
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,780
Analytics and AdSense, we really
focus on making sure

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,570
that users can get to the data
very quickly, with very low

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,840
latency, and don't require a lot
of deep domain knowledge

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,420
about the data that's contained

23
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,840
within those reports.

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,460
Really, the idea is that we want
these users to quickly

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,470
get to the data and get some
insights out of it and then go

26
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,110
and take action.

27
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,880
However, we also know that
there's a lot of users at our

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,770
clients &mdash; a lot of our clients
have in their teams data

29
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,050
scientists, data-savvy analysts
and developers, who

30
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,020
really want a much more granular
access to the data

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,740
within these products.

32
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,360
So for instance, some of the use
cases that we see here are

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,400
the developers that want a
SQL-like query interface so

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,940
they can actually get into the
granular data and really make

35
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,070
complex queries on the data
within there to sort of solve

36
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,060
specific problems or optimize.

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,980
They also tend to do things like
use some of the business

38
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,030
class, the enterprise class
visualization tools, things

39
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,420
like Tableau, which some of
you may be familiar with.

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,900
What they look for is getting
this data into Tableau and

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,780
doing things like building
enterprise-wide dashboards so

42
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,590
that a company can see at a
glance how their business is

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,260
doing using data from
different data sets.

44
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,650
And a lot of times, what we've
heard is that these companies

45
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,860
want to get their AdSense and
Analytics data into those

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,940
visualization tools as well.

47
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,580
These users also tend to really
rely on their own data

48
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,590
warehouses, so in many cases,
what they would like to do is

49
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,140
join up data from different
data sources

50
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,420
into a single place.

51
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,560
So for instance, an online hotel
booking site may have a

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,360
database that contains all of
their profit margins for each

53
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,170
online booking.

54
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,910
And what they would like to do
is join that with data from,

55
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,440
let's say, Google Analytics and
be able to say not only

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,150
what are my most profitable
transactions, but actually

57
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,970
what were the online user
behaviors that led to those

58
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,600
transactions?

59
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,000
So they want to be able to join
this data all together in

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,450
the data warehouses.

61
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,080
Likewise, they may want to use
this granular data as an input

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
into other business
applications

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,910
that they may have.

64
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,270
For instance, an online
retailer may have a

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,970
personalization engine
application that they've built

66
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,300
for their home page.

67
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,080
And they want to take data from
Google Analytics and from

68
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,170
their CRM system, join that data
together, and when a user

69
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,450
lands on their home page, have
that application display to

70
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,600
that user a personalized view
of particular products that

71
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,770
that user may be interested
in purchasing.

72
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,790
So all of these different use
cases really require a very

73
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,140
deep access to the data
contained within these

74
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,540
products for these data
scientist users.

75
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,230

76
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:43,930
LOUIS COLLARD: Thanks, Clancy.

77
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,540
So this is where BigQuery
comes in.

78
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,600
It's Google's big data
analysis engine.

79
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,960
And it's been designed from the
beginning with these kinds

80
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,970
of use cases in mind.

81
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,310
So we decided the best thing
to do would be to leave our

82
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,650
existing interfaces as they
are for standard users and

83
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,010
make our data available in
BigQuery so that data

84
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,450
scientists can get the access
they need and take advantage

85
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,170
of BigQuery's existing
functionality.

86
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,050
So there's a few features I'd
like to call out which we

87
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,740
think make this a
really good fit.

88
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,790
So firstly scale, you can query
billions of rows of data

89
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,430
interactively.

90
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,839
So you can type an SQL-like
statement into your browser

91
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,620
and watch the results come
back almost straightaway.

92
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,690
You can also query from the
command line or from the API.

93
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,350
And as Clancy mentioned, you're
probably going to want

94
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,790
to join the Google data we're
making available with some of

95
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,020
your own data.

96
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,500
And Big Query gives you a
couple of options here.

97
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,400
You can either upload your data
into BigQuery and do all

98
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,440
your analysis in the cloud,
which can be pretty

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,200
cost-effective as it saves you
having to own and maintain an

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,770
equivalent hardware and
software stack.

101
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,700
Or if you are already using
some third-party data

102
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,730
warehousing and analysis
solution, then BigQuery

103
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,710
already has good integration
with a number of them.

104
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,010
So if you're using one of those,
you can just import the

105
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,510
data from BigQuery into your
existing solution.

106
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,770
If you are going to do that, you
can still take advantage

107
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,220
of BigQuery to reduce the volume
of data that you have

108
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,076
to import, either just by being
selective about the rows

109
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:08,730
that you import or by
performing some

110
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,130
pre-aggregation in BigQuery.

111
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,770

112
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,265
So I'm going to talk now
about the AdSense data

113
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:18,020
we're making available.

114
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,590
Hopefully, this looks familiar
to some of you.

115
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,830
It's the same data which
is available in

116
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,670
the UI and the API.

117
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,460
And we've got this split
into five tables.

118
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,380
The basic DailyReport table
exposes all of the common

119
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,930
dimensions.

120
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,750
And then the AdUnit,
CustomChannel, and UrlChannel

121
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,480
dimensions are each available
in their own respective

122
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,350
tables, which all expose
all of the common

123
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,990
dimensions as well.

124
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,490
And lastly, we've got the Domain
table, which exposes

125
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,740
Date, Ad Client, Product,
and Domain.

126
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,870
So all of these tables expose
the same five raw AdSense

127
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,960
metrics that you see here.

128
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,820
You'll notice that CPC,
CTR, and RPM are

129
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,720
missing from that list.

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,700
That's because those are all
derived from these metrics,

131
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,870
which is something you can do
easily as part of your query.

132
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,920

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
So compared to the UI, this
gives you quite a bit of extra

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,740
flexibility, in that you can
request any combination of the

135
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,990
dimensions and metrics that are
available in those tables.

136
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,540
And you can run much
larger reports than

137
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,750
you can in the UI.

138
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,700
The data is still retrieved
live, so if you're watching

139
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,350
for updates throughout the
day, you'll see those

140
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,370
reflected in BigQuery.

141
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,010
And the data will match
what you see in

142
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,850
the UI at all times.

143
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,765
And obviously, it's still free
to query this data, so you

144
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,170
won't be charged by BigQuery
for querying these tables.

145
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,220

146
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,280
I've got here a very simple
query, just to retrieve your

147
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,110
top channels by earnings, just
to give you an idea of what it

148
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,750
would look like, really.

149
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,340
You can see in blue where it's
selecting and grouping by

150
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,580
custom_channel_id.

151
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,160
And then in green, we're
retrieving and

152
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,290
ordering by the earnings.

153
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,380
You probably already know your
top five custom channels, so

154
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,540
more interesting might be
channels that have grown the

155
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,830
most month-on-month.

156
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,680
This is something that's not
readily available in the UI,

157
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,600
but in BigQuery is quite
easy to retrieve.

158
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,640
We've got here a query which is
joining the results of two

159
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,830
subqueries.

160
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,460
In blue, we're retrieving
a customer

161
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,180
channel report for January.

162
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,550
And then in green &mdash; this is
truncated so it fits &mdash;

163
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,910
the same thing, but
for February.

164
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,950
Then the outer query in red is
joining the results of those

165
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,990
two subqueries on
custom_channel_name, then

166
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,780
calculating the delta on
the number of clicks

167
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,330
and ordering by that.

168
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:46,540
So if I switch to the BigQuery
browser tool, you can see I've

169
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,110
got the full query here.

170
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,400
If I just press Run on that, we
should pretty quickly get

171
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,650
back an answer.

172
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,820

173
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,720
And here we've got some
helpfully named custom

174
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,500
channels and the number of
additional clicks they got in

175
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,870
February compared to January.

176
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:12,400

177
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,620
Lastly, we mentioned third
party integration.

178
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,190
I'm going to show you a few of
the kinds of things that you

179
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,050
can do using Tableau, which is
one of the products that

180
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,300
already integrates
with BigQuery.

181
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:28,360

182
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,670
On the left-hand side here,
we've got the dimensions and

183
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,110
metrics that are available
in the BigQuery table.

184
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,980
And we're looking here at
a graph of earnings from

185
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,630
November to end of January.

186
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,760
So you'll notice there's
a fairly strong weekly

187
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,750
seasonality to the data.

188
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,750
And then we've got a much bigger
dip here, which turns

189
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,350
out to be Christmas.

190
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,240
Interesting, nothing
particularly actionable at

191
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,320
this point.

192
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,080
So let's dig a bit deeper.

193
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,780
If we add, say, platform, then
we can very quickly see an

194
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,900
interesting trend pop up after
Christmas, which is that the

195
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,610
orange and red sections, which
are mobile and tablet devices,

196
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,920
show quite a noticeable uplift
in revenue after Christmas.

197
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,095
So that would seem to indicate
people got some new devices

198
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:12,140
for Christmas, so that
kind of makes sense.

199
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,090
So we could decide to stop here
and go away and optimize

200
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,440
our site for mobile.

201
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,400
In this example, we actually
have different sites for

202
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,650
different countries.

203
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,290
So it's probably worth checking
if all the countries

204
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,590
are showing the same trends.

205
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,570
So if I just exclude desktop for
now, seeing as we're not

206
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,770
interested in that at the
moment, and then if I merge

207
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,800
these two together, seeing as
they're behaving roughly the

208
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:45,812
same, change this to a line, and
then add Country, then we

209
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:47,700
see another interesting trend.

210
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,790
So our two main earners here are
Australia in brown and the

211
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,120
UK in gray.

212
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,130
And it looks like it's
been a pretty good

213
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,650
Christmas for the UK.

214
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,420
The uplift in earnings there is
a lot more noticeable than

215
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,040
for Australia.

216
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,720
So at this point, we can go away
and optimize our UK site

217
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,140
for mobile first, knowing
that that will

218
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,390
have the biggest impact.

219
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:12,350

220
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,650
We're pleased to announce that
there's a beta version of this

221
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,720
integration available for all
AdSense publishers from today.

222
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,900
All you need to do to get
started is sign up for a

223
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,170
BigQuery project using the same
Google login as you use

224
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,800
for your AdSense accounts.

225
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,410
And that's it.

226
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,020
Then you can go and start
querying the tables.

227
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,440
We've got step-by-step
instructions on all of this on

228
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,290
the AdSense Developer site.

229
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,980
As I said, it is a beta,
so there probably

230
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,840
will be some bugs.

231
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,060
If you find them, please let
us know so we can fix them.

232
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,150
And the best place to do
that is on the forum.

233
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,730
Thanks very much.

234
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,929
I'm going to pass
back to Clancy.

235
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:45,402
CLANCY CHILDS: Cool.

236
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:49,670
[APPLAUSE]

237
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,210
CLANCY CHILDS: Thanks
a lot, Louis.

238
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,460
Similar to the AdSense
integration with BigQuery,

239
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,140
we're here today to announce
what we're doing with Google

240
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,990
Analytics and BigQuery.

241
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,770
So what are we announcing?

242
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,950
We are targeting in September
of this year a public launch

243
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,340
where Google Analytics Premium
clients will be able to have

244
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,870
their data from Google Analytics
Premium imported

245
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,120
into BigQuery.

246
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,710
What we're doing today is
we're also opening up a

247
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,610
developer group for developers
that may be interested in

248
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,990
working with this BigQuery
integration.

249
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,240
So I'll give you in a few
minutes a link that will take

250
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,980
you to a form where you can
register your interest in this

251
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,030
particular integration.

252
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,130
What are we actually
exporting?

253
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,500
It's a daily export of all of
the data within a Google

254
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,830
Analytics profile into
BigQuery, so

255
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,190
it's a daily export.

256
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,070
And the schema, which we'll be
sharing on the developers

257
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:52,070
group shortly, takes the shape
of every row in BigQuery in

258
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,630
this integration corresponds to
a session or visit in the

259
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,570
Google Analytics profile.

260
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,110
And so it will have information
on there like any

261
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,580
sort of visitor or visit-level
custom dimensions or

262
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,260
variables, things like
traffic source.

263
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,040
All of that visit-level
information is in each row.

264
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,920
But also within each of those
rows is a nested sequence of

265
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,630
all the hits that happened
in that visit.

266
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,180
So this would mean that, as
it's in a sequence, in the

267
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,595
order that they occurred,
every page view, event,

268
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:28,880
e-commerce transaction, and if
you're using the mobile SDKs

269
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,170
for Google Analytics,
things like

270
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,240
exceptions and screen views.

271
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,990
So you really actually get the
hit-level data, as well as the

272
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,800
session-level data in each
of these rows in

273
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,460
the BigQuery export.

274
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,370
Where possible, we are using the
same dimension and metric

275
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,460
names that we use for
the Core Reporting

276
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,050
API in Google Analytics.

277
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,280
We're using those as the column
names in BigQuery.

278
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,650
So if you already use the Core
Reporting API for Google

279
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,320
Analytics, you will have a
certain amount of familiarity

280
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,300
with the dimension names and
metric names in BigQuery.

281
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,140
One important note is that at
launch, this is going to

282
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,110
contain first-party data.

283
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,500
That means any of the data
that's actually collected by

284
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,540
either the Google Analytics
measurement protocol or any of

285
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,930
the tracking code or the
SDKs for mobile apps.

286
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,310
There's some data in Google
Analytics, for instance, GOIP

287
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,780
lookup, so the geography data,
that's actually post-processed

288
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,100
into Google Analytics.

289
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,590
And that data might
not be available

290
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,410
at launch in September.

291
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,090
However, we're going to
continually look to expand the

292
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,170
number of dimensions and metrics
that we can pass

293
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,330
through in this export
into BigQuery.

294
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,910

295
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,710
Starting today, if you're
interested in learning more

296
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,220
about this integration, you can
go to this short link or

297
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,550
scan the QR code.

298
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,780
There will be a form there.

299
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,990
And that form, if you just
explain to us what you're

300
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,710
hoping to do, we're just trying
to collect some data

301
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,520
about exactly how people are
looking forward to using this

302
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
integration.

303
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,850
And we'll add you to the
group, where we will be

304
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,420
sharing things like the schema
when it's ready to be shared,

305
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,440
things like a sample data set,
and all that sort of

306
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,990
information especially as we
come up to launch on this.

307
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,960
Please join.

308
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,530
And we'll be posting everything
there shortly.

309
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,190
But I can talk about all the
things we're going to do.

310
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,930
What makes a lot more sense
is for me to invite

311
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,340
Duncan McKie up.

312
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,490
Duncan is a senior &mdash;

313
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,740
[INAUDIBLE].

314
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,680

315
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,570
DUNCAN MCKIE: I like
to make a bang.

316
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,890
CLANCY CHILDS: So Duncan is a
senior business analyst for

317
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,700
eBay Classifieds Group.

318
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
EBay Classified &mdash;

319
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,680
are you done?

320
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,540
DUNCAN MCKIE: I think
I'm done.

321
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:52,970
I think I'm done.

322
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,160
Sorry guys.

323
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,740
CLANCY CHILDS: EBay Classifieds
Group is a Google

324
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,210
Analytics premium client.

325
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,160
They're also one of our larger
AdSense publishers as well.

326
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,770
So we've given Duncan early
access to both of these

327
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,760
integrations.

328
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,800
And he's been able to run a
bunch of queries and do a

329
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,220
bunch of really interesting
things with this.

330
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,500
And he's going to take us
through now some of the demos

331
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,910
that he's prepared.

332
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,420
DUNCAN MCKIE: Thank
you, Clancy.

333
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,840
Sorry, everybody,
for the bang.

334
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,490
Before we get started,
can I just get a

335
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,680
quick show of hands.

336
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
How many people managed to
attend the Big Data Mashup

337
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,533
session earlier?

338
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:24,340
OK.

339
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,420
So we've got quite a
few in the room.

340
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,480
How many people managed to
attend the cross-platform GA

341
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,260
optimization earlier?

342
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,860
OK.

343
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,030
So it's good to see there's
not too many people here.

344
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,800
We'll have lots of new content
for you, then.

345
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,050
OK.

346
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,280
So I'll start off just talking
about who I am.

347
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,250
I work for Gumtree.com,
which is part of

348
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,010
eBay Classifieds Group.

349
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,020
And we had probably
around 42 million

350
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,060
users in the last month.

351
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,015
That's across 27 countries
across the globe.

352
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:58,290
And unlike other e-commerce
websites, although we connect

353
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,090
our buyers and our sellers
together online initially, a

354
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,460
lot of those actually go
on to transact offline.

355
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,020
So for us, we like to think of
ourselves as a local company

356
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,110
even though we are global.

357
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,990
Now, every time one of our users
interacts with us, be

358
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,040
that on a website, on one of our
apps, or even through one

359
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,880
of our sales teams, that
generates data.

360
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,420
We have petabytes of the stuff
that's in MySQL, Postgres,

361
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,760
Salesforce.

362
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,700
It all gets pulled together
into a massive Teradata

363
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,080
warehouse, which I think at the
last count was round about

364
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,690
10 petabytes.

365
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,540
And we also have an awful lot
of external data as well,

366
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,670
things like Analytics and
AdSense that we'll talk about

367
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,200
today, and a lot of other stuff,
like DFP, Paypal, loads

368
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,460
of different sources of data.

369
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,570

370
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,710
Now we also have a lot
of different brands.

371
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,630
We have a lot of different
sites across the globe.

372
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,800
And that means that each of
our sites and countries

373
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,620
operates independently.

374
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,180
And we have a lot of these
different stores of data.

375
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,690
So all of our challenges
are kind of

376
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,020
magnified by about 30 times.

377
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,450
We have all of our data in
different locations in

378
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,480
different formats.

379
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,640
And the real challenge here is
how do we pull that together

380
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,430
and make it useful?

381
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,599
How do we turn data
into insight?

382
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,349
Now for some of our pro users,
these guys who know how to

383
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,400
connect to the different
systems, they know how to go

384
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,599
in and get this data themselves,
it's fine.

385
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,690
It's a little bit of a
challenge, but it's possible.

386
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,530
However, for our non-power
users, people like our

387
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,620
marketeers, our project
managers, the people who need

388
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,310
the information to be able to
make data-driven decisions,

389
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,450
it's not so easy.

390
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,110
We really want to be able to
pull all of this together and

391
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,690
put it in one place so it's
accessible for them and as

392
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,940
useful as possible.

393
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,320

394
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,230
Now how does BigQuery
fit into this?

395
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,960
Well, I'd like to talk about
how we use Analytics and

396
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,560
AdSense and pull these into
BigQuery, and we can use that

397
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,880
as a central location for some
of our users to get the data.

398
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,160
I'd like to take you through a
couple of different examples.

399
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,330
The first one is this.

400
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,330
We all hate it when this
happens, right?

401
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,320
So picture the scene.

402
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,550
Imagine me as a hipster.

403
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,020
I've just seen this awesome
new blue single-speed bike

404
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,780
that I really want to buy and
make all the other hipster

405
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,360
kids jealous.

406
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,500
And I'm just about to reply to
Clancy, who's selling it, when

407
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,940
I see one of these arrows.

408
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,170
And the worst case is I think,
I'll reply tomorrow.

409
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:31,970
It'll be fine.

410
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,650
And then the next day, I see
some other kid riding around

411
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,500
the neighborhood on my bike.

412
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,470
The worst case scenario is that
makes me never come back

413
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,180
to Gumtree.

414
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,230
And these kind of issues
actually cost us users.

415
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,600
It's a bad user experience.

416
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,190
And we want to stop it
as much as possible.

417
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,720
Unfortunately, it's not always
simple to do that in the

418
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,230
current Google Analytics user
interface, although there are

419
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,340
some excellent navigational
tools that help us page

420
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,010
backwards and forwards
through pageviews.

421
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,070
Some of our errors are actually
caused by things that

422
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,500
are not pageviews, things like
AJAX requests, things like

423
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,700
events that we're tracking.

424
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,390
Now that we can actually get
the hit-level data in

425
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,160
BigQuery, we can page backwards
and forwards through

426
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,640
these user journeys and really
start to examine them So let's

427
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,890
talk through how we
might do that.

428
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,940

429
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,010
Here you can see a query that's
just requesting some of

430
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,630
our Analytics data.

431
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,550
And in red, you'll see that
we've identified our errors

432
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,170
using a custom variable.

433
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,590
And we're doing a REGEXP_MATCH
on that at the bottom.

434
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,720
Also, you can see in green,
we're pulling out the hit

435
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,130
number for where the
error occurs.

436
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,920
And the information about
the session is in black.

437
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,990
The next step then is to do a
self-JOIN back on this data.

438
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,350
And I'd like to show you a
few things about this.

439
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,700
First of all, in blue you can
see that we're JOINing on the

440
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,020
session data.

441
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,730
Slightly on top of that, you can
see that we're using the

442
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,610
word EACH here.

443
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,820
Now the reason why we're doing
that is because this is a very

444
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,600
big data set.

445
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,880
We're talking millions
of rows.

446
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,330
If it's just a smaller
data set, you

447
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,330
don't need to use EACH.

448
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,160
The final thing I'd
like to show you

449
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,860
is the use of FLATTEN.

450
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,610
Now, because this Analytics
data is in a nested JSON

451
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,650
format, if we want to be able
to JOIN on these repeated

452
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,410
fields, we need to flatten it
out and turn it into a virtual

453
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,860
flat format.

454
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,510
The final step then is to
do one more self-JOIN.

455
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,960
We can use the hit data that
we've pulled out and the visit

456
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,530
data and then pull out all of
the meta-information about

457
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,550
this, things like the hour when
it occurred, the page

458
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,640
name of the hit that directly
preceded our error, and the

459
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,890
number of issues that
we're seeing.

460
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,910
And if we can just switch over
into BigQuery, we can give

461
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,160
that a run.

462
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,670

463
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,590
Now this is scanning through
approximately 14 million rows

464
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,680
just for one of these
derived tables.

465
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,770
We've done that three times,
so that's 42 million rows.

466
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,460
And that takes 10 seconds.

467
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,710
It's blindingly fast.

468
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,370

469
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,660
So having a table of
results is useful.

470
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,200
But the great thing is being
able to plug this into one of

471
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,530
our BI tools, something like
Tableau, which we're seeing a

472
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,880
lot of love for at the moment,
and being able to track this

473
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,000
over time and automate the
reporting process.

474
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,070
From the table, we can just see
that Search has given us

475
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,700
1,775 errors.

476
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,730
But if we actually map this over
time, we get a much more

477
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,020
interesting picture, and we can
see how these errors have

478
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,945
evolved and which of the
different pages have caused

479
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:39,195
the most errors.

480
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:43,330

481
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,340
Now we're showing an example
of using errors here.

482
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,390
But the great thing about having
all of our hits in

483
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,810
BigQuery is that we can
investigate any sequence.

484
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:58,480
So if you were wanting to look
at a conversion funnel, for

485
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,030
example, started with a
pageview, and then the user

486
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,480
goes on to fill in a form and
then later makes a purchase,

487
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,650
we can do that.

488
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,920
It's not currently possible
in the user

489
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,170
interface in Google Analytics.

490
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,280
We can only do a pageview
funnel.

491
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,160
So being able to get that kind
of visibility is really,

492
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,420
really useful.

493
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,540
And the even better thing about
it is we can look at

494
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,280
that historically.

495
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,655
We don't have to apply
this in advance.

496
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:23,630

497
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,080
The next use case I'd like to
talk about is how we segment

498
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,330
our onsite activity
at Gumtree.

499
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,660
Now whenever an ad is posted,
it has a number of different

500
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,830
attributes.

501
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,920
Some of those are simple, such
as the category and location.

502
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,360
Some of them are a little bit
more complicated, such as

503
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,580
whether it was paid for.

504
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,870
Most of these attributes,
they're fairly static.

505
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,820
They're directly related to the
user experience, and they

506
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,720
don't change too
much over time.

507
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,440
However, our business needs can
be a lot more changing, a

508
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,860
lot more dynamic, be that for
strategic purposes, for HR

509
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,110
reasons, many other reasons.

510
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,810
To illustrate this, let me
give you a quick example.

511
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,190
Let me tell you about
my colleague Ron.

512
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,530
Now Ron's a marketing analyst.

513
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,850
He's a great guy.

514
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,640
I have to say that in
case he's listening.

515
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,590
He's a great guy.

516
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,380
And when we started a couple of
months ago, he came up to

517
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,470
me and said, Duncan, why isn't
all of your traffic organized

518
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,180
by ISBA regions?

519
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,720
Ron, what the heck is
an ISBA region?

520
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,050
I've never heard
of that before.

521
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,340
So he explains to me it's a
non-overlapping television

522
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,280
broadcasting region.

523
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,040
And apparently, it's very
important in allowing us to

524
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,990
assess the online impact of
our offline marketing.

525
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,050
Now, if I wanted to query that
in the user interface, what

526
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,440
I'd have to do is create an
advanced segment and a custom

527
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,300
filter for every
single region.

528
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,840
And then I'd have to query
every one of those

529
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,500
individually every time
Ron wanted this data.

530
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,240
So you may ask, why don't
we just stick

531
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,470
another tag on the site?

532
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,350
Well, we're trying to put down
the amount of data that we're

533
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,300
sending backwards and forwards
to our mobile users.

534
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,300
And if we just aggregated it
up to these regions that he

535
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,110
wants, that might
change in time.

536
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,200
And we're going to lose some
of the granularity that we

537
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,420
really want.

538
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,370
So now that we have BigQuery,
how do we deal with this?

539
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,850
Well, I just say to Ron,
make me a lookup table.

540
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,800
And he'll get Excel out, he'll
type in a load of values, and

541
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,130
he'll make me a lookup table,
which I can then upload into

542
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,850
BigQuery in CSV format.

543
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,860
And we tried to be a little
forward-thinking here, so

544
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,400
instead of just uploading all of
the lookup details for our

545
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,460
ISBA regions, we'll just upload
all of our metadata,

546
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,774
because we've got plenty of
space to play with, right?

547
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,330

548
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,900
So once we've done that,
we need to query

549
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,030
our Analytics data.

550
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,900
So here we're using
a custom variable.

551
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,550
And we're going to call that
location_level_2, because

552
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,530
that's the level that
we want to look at.

553
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,680
And we're just pulling out,
again, the session data and a

554
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,990
little bit of aggregation
just relating to our

555
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,900
pageviews and bounces.

556
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,960
These are the metrics that we
can sum up with, so we can

557
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,290
aggregate them at this stage.

558
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,990
The next step, then, is to
aggregate our lookup table so

559
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,140
that we're only pulling out
the data that we need.

560
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,355
So again, we've got
location_level_2.

561
00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:10,950
But we're also taking
location_level_1, which is our

562
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,130
TV regions that we're
looking at.

563
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,840
We've also applied the filter,
so we're only getting back the

564
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,640
data that we're really
interested in.

565
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,430
Once we've got these two queries
together, we just do a

566
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,450
simple JOIN.

567
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,710
And you can see in red at the
bottom, we're JOINing on

568
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,740
location_level_2 from both
tables and then pulling out

569
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,970
the TV region from
our lookup table.

570
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,280
And in blue, you can see that
it's only at this stage, the

571
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,160
final stage, that we're actually
aggregating that.

572
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,350

573
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,860
So if we just switch over
to BigQuery again,

574
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,110
and we'll run that.

575
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,960

576
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,560
Again, this is running through
millions of sessions.

577
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,720
And it only takes 4
and 1/2 seconds.

578
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,040
So if we switch back to our
presentation, you can see the

579
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,440
results that we've
got back here.

580
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,720
We've managed to pull back all
of our regions that we're

581
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,580
interested in in one query.

582
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,930
It was very quick,
very easy to run.

583
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,930
And we've saved ourselves
a lot of time here.

584
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,660
The great thing about this as
well is we can connect this to

585
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,680
our BI tools.

586
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,560
And as we're only aggregating at
the final point, our users

587
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,560
can then use an interactive
dashboard and cut and slice

588
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,190
this data as they want.

589
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,440
And it will never be sampled.

590
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,260

591
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,800
The final use case I'd like to
talk about actually brings the

592
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,560
AdSense data and the Analytics
data together.

593
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,380
Now for those of you who aren't
familiar with A/B

594
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,570
testing, it's just the practice
of releasing two or

595
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,690
more variants of a particular
development at the same time.

596
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,460
And then we evaluate their
performance according to a

597
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,010
particular metric, a
particular goal.

598
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,130
This helps us to actually
improve our implementation

599
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,550
incrementally.

600
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,700
Now when we're doing that for
AdSense, we're not just

601
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,810
interested in the metrics
that relate to AdSense.

602
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,410
We're not just interested in
clickthrough rates or revenue

603
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,890
or whatever else.

604
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,950
We're interested in how these
ads actually impact on our

605
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,160
overall user experience,
whether it impacts on a

606
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,300
downstream conversion, for
example, or it affects user

607
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,070
engagement.

608
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,660
As a result, some of our
optimization metrics can be a

609
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,060
little bit complicated.

610
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,700
And they have to be derived
from various sources.

611
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,770
Usually this means that we have
to go into the different

612
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,290
user interfaces, query things
separately, and then put them

613
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,910
together in Excel.

614
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,640
It's a little bit long-winded.

615
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,240
And I don't like doing that.

616
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,087
I don't like doing anything
that I can't automate.

617
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:36,070

618
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,370
Now that we have BigQuery,
we can just automate

619
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,280
the heck out of it.

620
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,660
It's great.

621
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,080
So we'll just write a
quick query on our

622
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,990
AdSense data here.

623
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,060
You can see that we're using
custom_channel_name as our

624
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,680
AdSense group.

625
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,690
And we've just applied a little
tag onto all of our

626
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,810
users in AdSense so that we
can identify them from the

627
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,010
DailyCustomChannelReport.

628
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,750
We've also done that in
Google Analytics.

629
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,830
And we've used a custom variable
again this time.

630
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,800

631
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,160
The final step then, we just
do a very simple query that

632
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,580
JOINs together on those values
of our AdSense test groups.

633
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,100
So if we just switch over again,
jump back into BigQuery

634
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:24,880
and give that a run, how
long do you think

635
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,400
it's going to take?

636
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,450
5.7 seconds.

637
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,450
That's brilliant.

638
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:36,740
So if we load up the results
from that, now here we have

639
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,110
our three test groups.

640
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,450
And if I was to just look at the
AdSense metrics, I'd see

641
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,010
that the click-through rate
for testGroup3 is slightly

642
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,535
higher than the others.

643
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:48,780
And I may stop there and
just pick this group.

644
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,900
However, if we start to combine
our AdSense metrics

645
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,840
with the Analytics metrics,
we can see that actually,

646
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,870
testGroup2 has a higher
number of matched ad

647
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,260
requests per visitor.

648
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,900
That means that these guys are
actually being shown more ads,

649
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,850
and they're possibly
more engaged.

650
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,550
But it could be that actually,
these guys are just coming

651
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,400
back more often, and in a
particular session, they're

652
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,730
seeing less.

653
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,490
So if we also look at our
purely Google Analytics

654
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,840
metrics, our pageviews per
visit, we see that testGroup3

655
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,290
also has a higher value of
pageviews per visit, which

656
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,050
would suggest that these
guys are more engaged.

657
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,310
And then, by being able to look
at the bigger picture and

658
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,390
look at all of our metrics
together, we'd actually picked

659
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,610
testGroup2, which would be
different from the group that

660
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,860
we might have picked
otherwise.

661
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,150

662
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,790
Now this makes it really easy to
get all of the information

663
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,880
that we need in one place.

664
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,930
And the super-awesome thing
about this is if we use the

665
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,630
same Custom Dimension for every
single AdSense test that

666
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,070
we do, we only ever need to
set it up once, and we can

667
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,490
just sit back and be
lazy and be happy.

668
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:51,860
OK.

669
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,160
Thanks for listening,
everyone.

670
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,340
I'll hand you back to Clancy.

671
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:54,600
CLANCY CHILDS: Great.

672
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,470
Thanks a lot, Duncan.

673
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,410
I really appreciate that.

674
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,700
[APPLAUSE]

675
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,900
CLANCY CHILDS: So that shows us
the power of what this tool

676
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,010
can do when put in the capable
hands of a data

677
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,340
scientist like Duncan.

678
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,690
And this was actually &mdash;

679
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,740
he didn't have much time
to prepare for this.

680
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,730
So it's amazing that just with
this short amount of time,

681
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,510
he's able to start running
really interesting queries

682
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,470
that can actually really help
optimize some of the things

683
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,570
that they're working
on at Gumtree.

684
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,070
So thank you very much
for showing us that.

685
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,370
The next steps for everyone are
if you would like to get

686
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,570
started with BigQuery and
you haven't already,

687
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,080
bigquery.cloud.google.com.

688
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,150
Set up an account.

689
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,520
There's a lot of a public data
samples there already, so if

690
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,450
you just want to start playing
with data in BigQuery, it's

691
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,920
very easy to do.

692
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,630
For Google Analytics and
BigQuery, please register on

693
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,450
this form at this URL.

694
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,650
Or if you want to come by the
Ad Sandbox on the second

695
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,480
floor, we have this information
available as well,

696
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,270
the URL and the one-sheeter.

697
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,250
And again, we're launching this
in September for everyone

698
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,700
in Google Analytics Premium.

699
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,400
For the AdSense and BigQuery
integration that Louis

700
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,630
demonstrated, the beta
is available now.

701
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,100
And there's instructions at this
URL, where you can go and

702
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,710
actually start accessing AdSense
data in BigQuery.

703
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,730
So we're really excited
about this.

704
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,360
This is really a step forward
for getting more granular data

705
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,640
from both of these products
into the hands of data

706
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,770
scientists who are using
the BigQuery tool.

707
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,800
We're looking forward to see
all the really cool things

708
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,000
that everybody's going
to come up with.

709
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,100
And we look forward
to your feedback.

710
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,940
Thank you very much.

711
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,610
We really appreciate it.

712
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,240
We'll open it up
for questions.

713
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:43,350

714
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,150
DUNCAN MCKIE: Awesome.

715
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,968
CLANCY CHILDS: It was
that explanatory?

716
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:47,960
DUNCAN MCKIE: Cool.

717
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,460
CLANCY CHILDS: OK.

718
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,540
Or we could do the whole
thing again.

719
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:50,720
OK.

720
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,110
Yeah.

721
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,280
Do you mind taking the
mike so people &mdash;

722
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,850

723
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,010
AUDIENCE: I guess lots of us are
thinking sort of what data

724
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,410
sources are next, then.

725
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:05,140
Is there a schedule for them
or a priority for them?

726
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,490
CLANCY CHILDS: You mean other
Google data sources?

727
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,520
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

728
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,940
CLANCY CHILDS: We can only
really comment on the ones

729
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,430
that we work on, on AdSense
and Analytics.

730
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,000
But I think it's pretty clear
to see that BigQuery is

731
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,690
Google's big data query and
analysis tool, so I think it's

732
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,090
reasonable to assume that other
products will be looking

733
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,770
forward to getting their data
in there to get it into the

734
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,090
hands of data scientists.

735
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,760
AUDIENCE: Are there any limits
to the size, the number of

736
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,750
rows in the data sets?

737
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,760
CLANCY CHILDS: In BigQuery?

738
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

739
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,950
CLANCY CHILDS: There
are some limits.

740
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,090
They're very high.

741
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,660
I don't have offhand
the numbers.

742
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,960
I know that you can get things
like trillions of rows of data

743
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,220
into tables, and that in some
cases, if you try to export a

744
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,850
lot of data at once, you
might hit a limit.

745
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,040
So sometimes you have to just
make sure that you're not

746
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,960
doing a select star across
terabytes of data, which might

747
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,200
not be able to output.

748
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,510
But for specific questions on
BigQuery and the other things,

749
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,170
the Cloud Sandbox on the second
floor might be able to

750
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,160
give more detail.

751
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,910
It's also all posted online.

752
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,900
Sorry I don't have the
exact answer for you.

753
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,710

754
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,010
Great.

755
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,140
So again, these are the places
go to get more information.

756
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,900
And if you do have a second,
there's a QR code in the back

757
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,790
for rating the session.

758
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,080
We'd always appreciate any
feedback you have about the

759
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,500
session, so if you can
fill out there.

760
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,430
And we'll be down in the Ad
Sandbox as well if you have

761
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,260
any other questions you want
to ask us in person.

762
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,440
Thank you very much
for your time.

763
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,700
We really appreciate it.

764
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,800
[APPLAUSE]

765
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,225
