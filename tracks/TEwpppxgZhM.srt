00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,109

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,460
PETE LEPAGE: All right,
welcome everybody.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,430
Thanks for joining me.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,490
I did hear a little rumor
earlier that the description

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,390
for this was that you might
be coming up and

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,470
showing off your apps.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,530
If you were expecting that,
not so much today.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,660
What did you guys think of
the keynote this morning?

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,540
Liked it, yeah?

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,030
Awesome Cirque du
Soleil thing?

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,410
Cool, yeah?

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,390
All right, sweet.

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm going to be talking about
how to take a web app and turn

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,500
it into one of the new Chrome
packaged applications using

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,940
the new technologies that we've
got available to us.

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,430
Chrome packaged applications
do a lot of things that are

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,610
really cool.

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,780
And really allow us as
developers to build

19
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,020
applications using the
technology that we know today

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,120
already, that we know how to
use, divs and C S S and all

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,880
that great JavaScript stuff.

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,460
And build applications that feel
like they're installed,

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:10,830
that break out of the browser
so that they don't have that

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,200
browser bar cross the top.

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,695
They don't feel like that
experience of oh, I've got to

26
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:17,310
open the browser and then I
got to go to this site.

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,150
You click a button on the doc,
or you click something on the

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,830
start menu, and the application
starts just as

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,080
you'd expect it to.

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,230

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,280
With an enhanced UI that allows
us to really be able to

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,510
do things that we can't
normally do in web

33
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,430
applications.

34
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,980
I want to be able to
open a window.

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,740
I want to be able to move
it around or resize it.

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,280
I want to be able to do things
that with web applications I

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,330
can do today, but I might get
blocked because I'm not

38
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,230
allowed to open new pop-up
windows and things like that.

39
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,670
So an enhanced UI that really
lets us get beyond what we're

40
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,560
used to doing.

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,230
Offline by default, apps
that just work.

42
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,240
Today when an app gets installed
on your computer,

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,540
you expect it to work.

44
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,190
When an app get installed on
your phone, you start it, you

45
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,009
expect it to work whether
you've got an internet

46
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,540
connection or not.

47
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,260
Chrome packaged applications
should work like that.

48
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,500
Web applications should
work like that.

49
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,790
And we need to get users
thinking about that, right?

50
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,370
I got made fun of a little bit
when I used this reference, so

51
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,890
pardon me, but when my mom
starts a web app, she goes to

52
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,270
Gmail or wherever she's going.

53
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,260
If her computer's not connected,
she doesn't think

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,050
that it's going to
work if it's not

55
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,480
connected to the internet.

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,540
So for her, we need
to really say hey,

57
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,980
these apps work offline.

58
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,230
And Chrome packaged applications
allow us to do

59
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,730
that within this new model
that we've now got.

60
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,320

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,580
And my battery is dead, so I
guess I'm going to have to

62
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,270
move around.

63
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,960
My name is Pete LePage, I'm a
Developer Advocate on the

64
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,990
Chrome Team.

65
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,260
And it's my job to help folks
like you guys build web

66
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,140
applications, build Chrome
packaged applications, and

67
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,710
really take advantage of all the
cool stuff that you saw in

68
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,220
the keynote this morning.

69
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,435
And be able to get better access
to your customers, to

70
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:18,810
your users, and to all the fun
stuff that Chrome really has

71
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,330
to offer for you.

72
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,640
You can find me on Google+.

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,990
I'm also on Twitter, though I
don't tweet very often, as

74
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,890
well as my blog.

75
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,170
And I've got some stuff
up on GitHub.

76
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,740
So when I think about the legacy
packaged app, this is

77
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,930
what a legacy packaged
app looks like.

78
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,180
I've still got the address bar
up at the top, I still need to

79
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,230
start it in the same way.

80
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,860
In fact, let's get out of here
and let's have a look at a

81
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,090
little packaged app.

82
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,580
So we're going to take a
look at this particular

83
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,270
application.

84
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,160
This is just a simple
RSS reader that

85
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,510
I've gone and built.

86
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,590
Because I wanted to see what
it was like to build an

87
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,290
application and then convert it
to a packaged application.

88
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,380
So you can see I've got a list
of different feeds available.

89
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,520
I can go, I can scroll down, I
can go click on one of these.

90
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,170
But I still have the address
bar up here, I

91
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,160
can't open new Windows.

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,250
It's not exactly the best
connection, it's not exactly

93
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,800
the best experience that I
really want to have as I'm

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,140
reading through my RSS feeds
and all of that.

95
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,660
So I chose this application in
particular because it does a

96
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,150
couple of things really well.

97
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,730
One, it's a single-page
application.

98
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,240
So it works really well,
there's not a lot of

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,020
navigation from page
to page to page.

100
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,020
It should work offline.

101
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,420
I should be able to take all of
that data that I've got and

102
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,380
all of the stuff that I'm used
to using, and I should be able

103
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,560
to just say all right, great,
I want to access all of that

104
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,320
without having to do
anything else.

105
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,130

106
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,810
So we're going to walk
through what I went

107
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,270
through to get there.

108
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:21,020
So let's go back ti the slides
for a sec and try that again.

109
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,470
Hey, there we go, that looks
a little better.

110
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,340
So when you think of a legacy
packaged app, you had a

111
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,250
manifest file.

112
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,290
How many people have built a
packaged app or a Chrome app

113
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,760
in the past?

114
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,210
All right, so few people,
about half the room.

115
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,640
So you had a manifest file,
and that manifest file was

116
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,560
really what told Chrome how your
apps should work and what

117
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,020
it should start, where
it should go.

118
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,960
And within that manifest, it had
effectively a link, or it

119
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,180
said hey, when you start
I want you to go

120
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,040
open this index file.

121
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,580
And that index file might go off
and grab any resources it

122
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,300
might need, any HTML,
or C S S.

123
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,960
But all of that stuff fit into
as a package, into a zip file,

124
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,570
that you uploaded to the
Chrome Web Store.

125
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,770
And it could also sometimes
have a background page.

126
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,990
And you might use that
background page to say go pull

127
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,770
for data so that you
could pull data

128
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,970
down and save it somewhere.

129
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,290
You might use some
context menus.

130
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,140
But all of that stuff, you'd
have to set up a loop.

131
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,360
You'd have to either use a loop,
you'd have to use set

132
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,930
interval, there were a whole
bunch of things that would

133
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,800
cause some pain in the
butt sometimes.

134
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,050
And could potentially, if you
didn't write it very well or

135
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,170
used some bad practices or worst
practices, if such a

136
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,580
thing exists, could affect the
performance of Chrome for

137
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,280
everything else.

138
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,450
So one of the things that we
really wanted to address as we

139
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,110
started making these
enhancements to Chrome

140
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,270
packaged apps is
how we do that.

141
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,560
How do we make it easier so
that the applications that

142
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,800
you're writing, it's harder
to do the wrong thing.

143
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
So let's get started
and have a look at

144
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,050
how I converted this.

145
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,930
Now, I'm going to throw
up this warning.

146
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm just going to say
time out for a sec.

147
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,920
This is a developer preview,
this is not something that you

148
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,330
can go ship a production-level
app on.

149
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,930
If you do, congratulations.

150
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,330
You can't get it in the
Chrome Web Store.

151
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,850
But if you give it out to a
bunch of users, it probably

152
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,820
will break at some point
in the future.

153
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,750
So just that word of warning as
you're playing with this.

154
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,540
If you're like hey, this worked
yesterday, but now that

155
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,200
I got a Chrome update
it doesn't work.

156
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,500
Go have a look at the docs for
known issues in any updates.

157
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,950
Because things are changing on
a regular basis, and we're

158
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,120
working to get a lot of
new great stuff added.

159
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,580
And sometimes that means taking
your feedback and going

160
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,310
oh, guess we didn't think
about that one too well.

161
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,200
I guess we better change that.

162
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,060
So getting your feedback is
really important to us.

163
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,680
We want to hear what you
have to say about these

164
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,890
applications as you're
building them.

165
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,370
What are your experiences?

166
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,430
How do we need to make these
things better so that you can

167
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:15,600
build the type of applications
that you want to build?

168
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,390
So with the new architecture,
it changes a little bit.

169
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,870
Remember before we had our
manifest which would then

170
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,570
kick-off an index file?

171
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,350
In a new Chrome packaged
application, instead of

172
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,289
kicking-off an index file,
the first thing that the

173
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,770
application does is it kicks-off
a background script.

174
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,900
So that background script, think
very similarly to if

175
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,120
you're writing a native
application for Windows or for

176
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,810
Android or for any
other device.

177
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,700
There's some kind of like C#
file, or there's some main

178
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,920
file that might kick open other
windows and all that

179
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,600
kind of stuff.

180
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,380
It works in the same way.

181
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,740
So that background script is
going to go, and it's going to

182
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,010
start running first thing.

183
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,930
And when you want to start the
application, it then goes and

184
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,770
opens your application
UI window.

185
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,180
So it says, oh hey, the
user wants to start.

186
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,640
I guess I should open this
window up, and it goes and

187
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,860
opens that window.

188
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,290
So the difference here, and
the really important thing

189
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,340
here, is that background
script needs

190
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,340
to listen for events.

191
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,780
We'll talk about
that in a sec.

192
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,750
So the application that we used,
we didn't use all of the

193
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,510
technology that's possibly
available to us,

194
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,710
but we used a bunch.

195
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:36,830
When we used the Chrome
experimental apps API &mdash;

196
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,250
maybe it's just standing
too far away.

197
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,210
Maybe if I go over here.

198
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,430
We used the chrome.storage.sync.

199
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,720
I'm going to talk about
each of these in

200
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,660
depth in a little bit.

201
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,600
But chrome.storage.sync, how
many people used chrome.sync

202
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,550
in Chrome when they used Chrome
today to sync all your

203
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,340
passwords, your favorites,
all that kind of stuff?

204
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,880
And, kind of cool,
chrome.storage.sync basically

205
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,510
lets you take whatever you want
for your application,

206
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,440
within a set of limits
obviously, and store that

207
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
stuff up in the cloud.

208
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,120
So that no matter which computer
I'm logged into, I

209
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,190
have all of those settings
synced across all machines.

210
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,400
So I can have maybe my
credentials, maybe a list of

211
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,860
read items.

212
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,770
All of that stuff I can keep
synced in the cloud.

213
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,530
Chrome.storage.local which is
very similar, but it only is

214
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,890
local to that specific
machine.

215
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,850
We use Chrome alerts to notify
the user of a bunch of stuff.

216
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,620
We use sandbox pages, and I'm
going to talk about Content

217
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,140
Security Policy in a little
bit and why we'd

218
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,000
use a sandbox page.

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,830
And we used Angular.js.

220
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,260
We used Angular.js because
Angular did something that

221
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,310
made our lives a little
bit easier.

222
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,880
How many people have heard of
Content Security Policy?

223
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,320
Yay, OK, only a couple hands.

224
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,450
We're going to go into
more depth on this.

225
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,570
This is something that's really
important, but it could

226
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,180
change the way we think
about a lot of stuff.

227
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,930
And it's, like I said, it's
really important and it will

228
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,150
make the web a lot safer.

229
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,480
Nice big eye chart.

230
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
This is how the app is
kind of laid out.

231
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,880
So you can see right there in
the center of the app is that

232
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,560
background page.

233
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,800
And that background page goes
and does all of the stuff we

234
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,690
need to do.

235
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,410
And I promise, we will get into
real code here shortly.

236
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,400
I think it's like one slide
or two slides away.

237
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,280
So we've got that background
page, and it goes off and

238
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,490
kicks-off the app page there
at the very bottom.

239
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,650
It goes over and it gets access
to data in different

240
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,460
data places.

241
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,565
And it goes up to the cloud
and it asks for feeds.

242
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:37,700

243
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,520
So the first thing we need to
do in our application is we

244
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,210
need to update the manifest.

245
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,690
The manifest for a new packaged
app has changed a

246
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,900
little bit, and I want
to highlight a

247
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,615
couple of the changes.

248
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:51,510
So the first thing that changes
is we need to add a

249
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,360
manifest version 2.

250
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,020
Manifest version 2 tells Chrome,
hey, this is a new

251
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,340
Chrome packaged app.

252
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,720
It also turns on Content
Security Policy.

253
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,730
Second thing, we want to add
offline true, because our apps

254
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,110
are designed to work offline.

255
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,320
Everything that we have we need
for our application is

256
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,560
sitting there in our zip file in
our package that we zipped

257
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,400
up and uploaded and
is good to go.

258
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,000
The next thing is we
need to add the

259
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,500
app background scripts.

260
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,180
If you remember before in V1
apps, that was where we put

261
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,920
our index file.

262
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,970
We said, hey, this
is my index file.

263
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,560
And then finally, we need to
add a couple of specific

264
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,620
permissions.

265
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,790
We need to add the app window
permission which says hey, we

266
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,840
want to be able to open windows,
we need to be able to

267
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,760
manipulate windows.

268
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,540
We want to do all that stuff.

269
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,670
And then we need experimental.

270
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,680
Now, we are only going to need
experimental while we're in an

271
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,530
experimental stage, so
that will go away

272
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,190
sometime in the future.

273
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,720
And that right now is one of the
things that will prevent

274
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,360
your app from getting uploaded
to the Chrome Web Store.

275
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,710
So if you go and you're like,
hey, I got this great app and

276
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,830
I want to get it in,
and you're like

277
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,840
why won't it upload?

278
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,740
Well, that's a big part
of the reason.

279
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,370
So let's go and actually
do that.

280
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,990
So I have here my text editor.

281
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,620
And don't worry, we got some
nice decent size fonts here.

282
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,270
And instead of doing it in
there, I'm going to do it in

283
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,420
my Updated, and I'm going
to go grab my manifest.

284
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,210
All right, so we need to
add a couple of things.

285
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:39,640
So we need to add our manifest
version, and we want to set

286
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,620
that guy at two, right?

287
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:48,430
We want to add offline enabled,
and we want to set

288
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,050
that to true.

289
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,750
Then, remember we said we had
to change from the index to

290
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,760
instead use our background
page?

291
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,770
So I'm going to say background,
and I'm going to

292
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:11,020
go here and say scripts, and
turn that into an array,

293
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,270
because we can have multiple
background scripts.

294
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,050
And I'm just going to say
background.js, and I'm going

295
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,790
to put that in my js folder.

296
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,785
All right, two other things
we need to do.

297
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:29,150

298
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:41,010
Run permissions, and appWindow,
and experimental.

299
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:48,120
All right, so we've done
all the things we

300
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,290
needed to do here.

301
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,220
So we've got our manifest
set to go.

302
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,500
We can't actually go hit run
yet, because we don't have our

303
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,180
background page.

304
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,550
So let's have a look at what
is in our background page.

305
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,730

306
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,870
So in our background page we're
going to put primarily

307
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,950
just one chunk of
code for now.

308
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,520
And that's the listen for the
application start event.

309
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,980
So instead of doing loops and
all kinds of other stuff like

310
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,420
we did before in the legacy
packaged apps, everything is

311
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,620
event-driven, event-based.

312
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,750
So we want to say right there
in the top bit of our app,

313
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,120
Chrome experimental app
unlaunched, add listener.

314
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,440
So we want to say we want
to listen for an event.

315
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,990
And we then say all right, when
that event fires we want

316
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,910
to start and create
a new window.

317
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,370
And the window we want to create
is the index HTML.

318
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,800
Now, I can also add a couple
additional properties.

319
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,110
So I can say I want that window
to open up at 1024 by

320
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:55,170
768, I wanted it to open at 100
pixels over and 100 pixels

321
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,170
down, and type shell.

322
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,860
All right, we're just going
to cheat a little bit.

323
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:15,690
We're going to copy this and new
file, paste that guy in,

324
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,940
background.js.

325
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,210

326
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,540
So we've got our background
page in, so it's there.

327
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,675
Now when the app starts, we're
going to be good to go.

328
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:30,040

329
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,710
There's a couple other events
that we can listen for, like

330
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,180
the uninstalled and an
on suspend event.

331
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,880
We're not going to worry about
those right now, because

332
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,690
really the only thing we want to
do right now when we start

333
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,550
is the on start.

334
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,750
Couple of things we need to
do just in preparation.

335
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,060
In the future we probably
won't have to do this,

336
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,890
but for now we do.

337
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,520
This stuff is only available
in Chrome Canary.

338
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,320
There's a reason for that, kind
of fun, kind of a little

339
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,940
bit on the edge.

340
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,510
Chrome Canary's where
you can always get

341
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,119
the latest and greatest.

342
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,190
It will be in dev
channel soon.

343
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,720
Now the great thing about
running it in Chrome Canary is

344
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,700
that you can run Chrome Canary
and Chrome Stable or Chrome

345
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,680
Beta or Chrome Dev
side by side.

346
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,760
So that way if you're ever like
OK, well, I want to go

347
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,460
try something and see how it
works and I still need to

348
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,349
actually be able to browse and
do my real stuff, you can have

349
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,569
those both side by side.

350
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,700
So Chrome Canary, and then we
need to just go add our app,

351
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,260
just like we did with the
legacy packaged app.

352
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,170
So the first thing I'm
going to do, let's go

353
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,000
over to Chrome Canary.

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,410
And I'm going to close this guy
out, I'm going to go to

355
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,990
Tools, and Extensions.

356
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,640

357
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,100
So I've already checked the
developer mode, so I'm going

358
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,961
to go and load an unpacked
extension.

359
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:54,440
So I'm going to grab this, click
Select, a-ha, all right,

360
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:02,934
dictionary keys must be
quoted, so line 16.

361
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,470
You know that pink thing that's
right there might have

362
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,140
given it away when I was
doing this early.

363
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:14,445

364
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:15,810
Try that again.

365
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,980

366
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,820
All right, so now if I
go over here, you'll

367
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,610
notice I've got my legacy.

368
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,720
We've got my final, so we'll see
what that looks like in a

369
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,290
sec, but I've got the updated.

370
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,680
One thing you'll notice, the
difference between the legacy

371
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,580
and the updated, the legacy is
kind of gray there because I

372
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,400
don't have an internet
connection right now.

373
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,110
By putting that offline enabled
there, it tells the

374
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,200
app hey, this app
works offline.

375
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,340
And as we go through and have
a look at why it works

376
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,420
offline, you'll get into this
a little bit deeper.

377
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,890
But let's go and
start our app.

378
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:02,550
Hmm, OK, it's started, but it
doesn't look very good.

379
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,910
I would expect to see some
numbers there, I'd expect to

380
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,930
see some data.

381
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,700
At least we have an app running,
our window opened.

382
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,219
We've got a sad panda, we
can deal with sad panda.

383
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:18,010

384
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,470
All right, so let's see that in
action, we already saw it.

385
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,790
What happened there?

386
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,530
We actually got hit by something
called Content

387
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,820
Security Policy there.

388
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,310
I asked how many people
have heard about

389
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,590
Content Security Policy.

390
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,940
It's a new thing that's coming,
and it's going to make

391
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,000
the web a lot safer.

392
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,230
But it also makes things a
little bit different for us as

393
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,590
developers, because we have
to approach things

394
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,280
in a different way.

395
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,050
I kind of like to use a little
bit of an analogy of it, and

396
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,850
talk about it as when you
take the kids trick

397
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,340
or treating at Halloween.

398
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,950
They go out to all these
strangers' houses and the

399
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,980
strangers give them candy.

400
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,830
And you get home, and as
parents, the parents sort

401
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,920
through the candy and say you
can have this, you can't have

402
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,100
this, you can have this.

403
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,360
As a kid, you're like I want
all of it, it's all good.

404
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,680
Like, you want all that
candy, but some of

405
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,130
it's potentially dangerous.

406
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,730
The web is very similar.

407
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:24,510
When we say hey, you can take
anything you want, you might

408
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,790
get good stuff, right?

409
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,050
You might get great stuff, you
might get great data feeds,

410
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,230
you might get whatever
you want.

411
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,710
But somebody out there might be
malicious and say oh, I'm

412
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,430
going to give you some bad
stuff, and you're going to get

413
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,830
something like a cross-site
scripting vulnerability.

414
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:46,010
Well, Content Security Policy
basically says on the web you

415
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:50,190
are allowed to get content, data
source, whatever, from

416
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,770
these places, but
not from these.

417
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,440
So just like when your parents
came in at Halloween and said

418
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,760
you can have this candy but you
can't have this, Content

419
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,540
Security Policy does
that same thing.

420
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,230
It says this is safe,
this is not.

421
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,690
Now with Chrome packaged apps,
we said you know what, let's

422
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,870
make these apps as
safe as we can.

423
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,040
So we put a relatively strict
set of rules on that.

424
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,750
So let's talk about a couple
of the things that are

425
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,490
potentially dangerous, why
we block them, and

426
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,530
what's going on.

427
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,880
So any code that comes from
outside of your control, so

428
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,110
that's not delivered in the
package of your application,

429
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,730
is going to be blocked.

430
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,280
That means if you try and go
get Google Analytics, the

431
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,310
ga.js kind of code, that's
going to be blocked.

432
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,240
Sure, you get it from
Google Analytics.

433
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,060
We're probably not evil, at
least I hope we're not.

434
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,500
Well, we've got this
thing that says

435
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,680
don't be evil, right?

436
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,550
So that's OK, but we don't know
where you're going to go

437
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,410
get all this stuff from.

438
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,560
So we say if it's not your
package, you can't have it.

439
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,870
Because you might go and get
something from somebody else's

440
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,580
source, maybe somebody said
oh hey, I'll host Google

441
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,760
Analytics code for you.

442
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,030
And all a sudden it's not
actually that code anymore,

443
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,670
and they're doing something
malicious with it.

444
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,760
So if it's code from outside of
your control, you can't put

445
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,140
it in the app.

446
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,970
Second thing, we block
inline scripts,

447
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,800
including JavaScript URLs.

448
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,710

449
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,550
That one kind of sucks, right?

450
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,040
We're kind of used to
sometimes doing

451
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,820
that kind of stuff.

452
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,270
Now, it's not exactly a best
practice for doing that, but

453
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,730
inline scripts &mdash; the problem
with inline scripts is, so

454
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,590
we're looking through this HTML,
and we come across a

455
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,220
script block.

456
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,840
Well, if we come across a script
block, how do we know

457
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,330
that you as the developer
actually put that in there

458
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,070
versus somebody injecting that
in via some kind of cross-site

459
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,170
scripting attack, or
something else?

460
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:51,030
So anything that could get
injected into the HTML, nope,

461
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,230
sorry, we're not going to let
that happen because it could

462
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,980
potentially allow that
cross-site scripting.

463
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,840
This one I think should be
pretty obvious why we don't

464
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,620
let you have eval.

465
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,720
Eval is kind of evil, it's
one letter away.

466
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,420
So unsafe code execution like
eval, because you could

467
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,540
basically take any text, run it
through eval, turn it into

468
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,470
some nice, cool, nasty
script, not so good.

469
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,170
Pretty much every browser today
supports JSON.parse and

470
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:23,920
JSON.stringify.

471
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,630
String/file.

472
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,620
So realistically, the need for
eval is pretty limited.

473
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,670
There are a few places where
eval is useful and

474
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,920
where eval is good.

475
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,930

476
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,910
Safe, good, protecting your
users, protecting your

477
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,575
customers, protecting your
data, potentially evil.

478
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:49,480
Hmm, I usually like the
safe, good better.

479
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,720
So let's have a look at a
practical example, like a very

480
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,250
specific example here.

481
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,500
So this is in the HTML of my
application, I've got a

482
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,270
function that says callme and
it prints out a little line.

483
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,440
And I've got a button, and the
button has an onclick directly

484
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,400
on it that calls the function,
and I've got

485
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,820
some text in there.

486
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,430
So that's not going
to work, right?

487
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:20,040
We've got both an inline script
block, and we've got

488
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,790
inline script in our
button as well &mdash;

489
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,740
not going to happen.

490
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,570
So here's the better
way to do it.

491
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,560
It's a couple more lines of
code, but it's the better

492
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,700
practice to do it.

493
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:37,880
First thing we do, we've got our
script block that links to

494
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,630
our file, and then we put
our button there that

495
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,230
says hey, call me.

496
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,920
It's got an ID on the button so
that we can get access to

497
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,140
it a little bit later.

498
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,500
And then we have our
function in the

499
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,670
JavaScript that says callme.

500
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:55,040
And we add an event listener
to say hey, go grab that

501
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,100
callme button and add a listen
so that when the user clicks

502
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,270
on it maybe they call.

503
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:05,370
Sorry, bad pun, bad joke, I like
that song, I admit it.

504
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,540
I'll go away in shame now.

505
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,600
So this is the better
way to do it.

506
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,440
There's a bunch of really great
content out there that

507
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,590
talks about CSP.

508
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,800
I've got a link to it at the end
of the slides, it's really

509
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,660
worth having a look at.

510
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,770
Converting from inline script
blocks and that kind of stuff,

511
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,570
not an impossible thing to do.

512
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,080
It takes a little bit of work
and a little bit of rethinking

513
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,420
on our part, but something
really important

514
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,140
that we should do.

515
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,182
So one of the things I'm going
to do, let's actually get out

516
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:39,350
of here for a sec.

517
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,910
And before we go over there,
let's tab over here.

518
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,920
So one of the reasons why I
chose to use this app and why

519
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:55,870
I chose to use Angular, is
Angular actually has some CSP

520
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,470
ability to deal with it right
inside so that I don't have to

521
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,510
go and deal with all
the craziness.

522
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,790
I can actually just go ng-csp.

523
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,490

524
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,910
And that now, if I did
everything right, I'm going to

525
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:20,060
close this guy, open this up,
and I didn't do it right.

526
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:27,306
All right, I'm going to cheat
one sec, I'm going to have a

527
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:28,650
look at my file over here.

528
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,710
Ng-csp, that was the
right thing to do?

529
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,270
Oh, yeah, reloading helps.

530
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,990

531
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:43,700
So over here, go reload my
app, and sure enough, it

532
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,870
doesn't work again.

533
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,810
I can come back to that, because
I've actually got

534
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,960
something else I'm going to
do in my next step here.

535
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:57,680

536
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,100
So one of the other things that
is really important and

537
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:07,030
really useful to do in moving
your app to a packaged app, is

538
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,590
taking that shared and common
functionality, pulling it out

539
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,810
of your JavaScript places where
it's going to get used

540
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,910
in multiple places,
and putting it

541
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,700
into the same place.

542
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,140
So with the RSS reader
application we've got, it goes

543
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,800
up and it pulls for data, and
then it pulls that down and it

544
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,650
goes and puts it into
a data store.

545
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,610
So for something like this, we
want to take that and put that

546
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,910
into the background page.

547
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,390
So that we take all that shared
code that's all over

548
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,210
the place, maybe a little bit
spaghetti-like, and try and

549
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,640
really reduce some of the
work that's going on.

550
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,330
One of the ways that
you can do that and

551
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,520
that's really useful &mdash;

552
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,380
we'll dive into the
chrome.storage API in a sec &mdash;

553
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,540
but in my application I could
take this chrome.storage

554
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,700
listener and I can say hey,
anytime anything changed I

555
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,780
want you to go listen
for this.

556
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:11,415
And I want to update all of the
rest of the page so that

557
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:14,490
oh hey, I just got new feeds,
let's go update what's

558
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,740
displayed to the user.

559
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,940

560
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,340
So I was talking a little bit
about the package, making

561
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,210
stuff work offline.

562
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,280
And making applications work
offline, we can do it on the

563
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,870
web today, but it is a small
pain in the bum to put it

564
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,690
mildly, right?

565
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,880
Like, there's AppCache, then
you've got to deal with well,

566
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,560
where are you going to put it?

567
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,480
Are you going to put it in an
index db, you going to put it

568
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,380
in local storage, are you
going to put it &mdash;

569
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,800
where are you going to put it?

570
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,470
And well, typically as web
developers we say hey, let's

571
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:53,170
go get data from the cloud and
then display it on screen.

572
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,140
Oh well, maybe we should just
store it locally, too.

573
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,350
So when you start to think about
your applications and

574
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,460
how they should work offline, we
want to think about them in

575
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,520
a little bit of a
different way.

576
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,860
So we've got our packaged app,
and our packaged app should

577
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,860
talk to a local data
store first.

578
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,870
So some kind of local
data storage.

579
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,220
That way, if I have no network
connection I'm always going to

580
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,410
be able to pull data in.

581
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,020
I start my app, hey look,
there's data.

582
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,190
It may be stale and old data,
but at least I've got

583
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,860
something, right?

584
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,870
Like, you go to Goggle+, you go
to any other site, you want

585
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,485
to see something when
the app starts.

586
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:38,780

587
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,800
Now, it'd be really kick butt if
we could also store all of

588
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,700
that data in the cloud
so that it was synced

589
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,130
across all of my computers.

590
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,610
So that I didn't have to go oh,
hey, well I haven't run

591
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,550
this app in a while on this
computer, so I guess I don't

592
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,470
have this data.

593
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,520
I want all the stuff synced
across the cloud so that I

594
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,650
open my Chromebook, great,
I've got all that data.

595
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:05,110
I open my iPad with Chrome on
it, I've got all that data.

596
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,540
I've got, open whatever device
I've got, I've got all of that

597
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,410
stuff synced across the cloud.

598
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,870
And there's a great new Chrome
API that's going

599
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,700
to help me do that.

600
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:22,390
And then finally, from our local
data store, or from our

601
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,070
background page, we want to go
and have that talk to the

602
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,050
backend services for
our application.

603
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,440
So our packaged app, our UI, is
never talking to any kind

604
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,190
of application server-side
stuff.

605
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,470
All of that is happening on
a separate business layer.

606
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:43,030
When you think about, if you've
taken computer science

607
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,840
classes and you separate out,
hey, here's my business layer,

608
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,890
here's my display layer,
here's all this stuff.

609
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,120
You're separating all those out
and that's what we really

610
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,810
want to see in these
packaged apps.

611
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,410
So that your app talks to
the data store, pulls

612
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,010
everything in there.

613
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,850
And then the background page or
any of those other pieces

614
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,740
then go and pull stuff
in so that we can

615
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,640
deal with those pieces.

616
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,340
So we have this new set of
chrome.storage APIs.

617
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,760
They give you all the power of
Google's Chrome Sync stuff

618
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,080
without having to go deal with
oh, well, I got to go set up a

619
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,990
bunch of servers.

620
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,850
I got to figure out how
to do data syncing.

621
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,110
I got to figure out how to
do all these things.

622
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,910
Now it's not meant for
you to store tons and

623
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,930
tons and tons of data.

624
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,330
That's Google Drive, and we do
have some easy abilities for

625
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,300
you to get into that.

626
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,990
They're not quite there yet,
we're not going to talk about

627
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,820
those in today's session.

628
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:48,770
But to be able to store user
settings, not necessarily

629
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,610
login information, but
application settings, or

630
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,660
little bits of data like key
value pairs is exactly what we

631
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,840
want to use this chrome.storage
API.

632
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,600
So there's a couple of things
we need to do it in

633
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,370
order to use it.

634
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,980
One, we need to turn on the
storage permission, because it

635
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,550
needs a permission.

636
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,770
And then there's two things we
can do, we can get and we

637
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,940
could save &mdash;

638
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,200
or I guess that's
technically set.

639
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,720
There are some other APIs, but
these are the key things I

640
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,500
want to show you here.

641
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,550
So if I want to save something,
I use this set.

642
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,460
Let me highlight this out
here for a sec, and

643
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,310
we send it in object.

644
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,720
That object is just a name value
pair, or a JSON Object.

645
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,830
So I've got hey, here's all of
the Chromium articles that

646
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,470
I've got that I want to
save, and I give it

647
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,700
that list of items.

648
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,960
And then I've got a call back
that's used to say all right,

649
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,260
everything's saved, you're good
to go, all hunky dory.

650
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,220

651
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:57,290
To get that stuff out of the
back side, we use the

652
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:05,630
chrome.storage.sync.get, and we
just ask for what we want

653
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,280
and we give it a call
back again.

654
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,220
And so Chrome says OK,
yep, you want that?

655
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,880
Sure, no problem, I'll give
that to you in a sec.

656
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,570
Goes off, gets it, and pulls
it down and gives it to you

657
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,330
via that callback.

658
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,950
So let's actually go take a look
at the code we've got.

659
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,650
And trying to do the two things
that I just talked

660
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:33,550
about up on stage would have
been a little messy because it

661
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,070
changes a lot of stuff
in this application.

662
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,140
So I want to show you the things
that we did in order to

663
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,970
get that to work.

664
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:45,120
So our background page before,
you remember, was just that

665
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,790
start for our application.

666
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:53,530
So we've got that still in here,
so we add our Chrome

667
00:33:53,530 --> 00:34:01,250
Experimental app launched, and
we open up our window.

668
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,380
And we've moved a lot of the
code that our application is

669
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,219
using out into here.

670
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,960
So we've got a factor here
that's going to go and do our

671
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,790
feed fetching.

672
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:23,290
So all of our feed fetching, all
of our feed syncing, all

673
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,489
of that is done here in
our background page.

674
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:31,020
So we've got our factory to
get our feeds, we've got a

675
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,280
factory again here where we're
refreshing things, and then

676
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,860
we've got some angular stuff as
well down here, just sort

677
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,620
of angular filtering stuff.

678
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,520
We've also gone and created
a store module.

679
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,389
So Angular allows you to have
these concepts of modules.

680
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,620
So we've got in here our store
module, we create our factory,

681
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,449
and we want to say hey, we've
got our state store and our

682
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,699
content store.

683
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:02,080

684
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:08,000
As we're working on this, we
sort of said OK, we're storing

685
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,680
large amounts of data.

686
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,410
How do we do that in
a really good way?

687
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,950
How do we take all of that
information and put it in the

688
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:22,770
user's hands without sending
lots of data up to the cloud,

689
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,680
without overloading all the
user's synced storage space

690
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,420
and complexities?

691
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:34,870
Said OK, well, what if we
separate out the blog feed,

692
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:40,130
each RSS poster, each RSS
item, from its state?

693
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,130
So we said we want to sync all
of the state, whether it's

694
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,490
been read or not, and whether
it's been starred or not, and

695
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,700
we're going to store that
up in the cloud.

696
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,680
Because that's, what,
two bits?

697
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,390
It's not even a byte for
that matter, because

698
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,940
it's just like a Boolean.

699
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,800
And then we store all of the
information about the feeds on

700
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,140
the user's local computer,
because we can always go get

701
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,240
those later, those
are easy to get.

702
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,870
So we've separated those two
things in our data storage.

703
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,070
And then when we go to actually
get these things,

704
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,320
just sort of scroll down here.

705
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:25,430

706
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:30,490
So we go and get our feeds from
content storage, which

707
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,390
Angular then has a way to say
hey, if there's everything in

708
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,340
there, we want to go and do
a forEach on each of them.

709
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,530
So we're going to go and iterate
through each item and

710
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,155
go and add them to the
user's display.

711
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:45,480

712
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,910
So let's go and add this guy.

713
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,860
So I'm going to load our
unpacked extension, and we'll

714
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,540
grab number three that
we've refactored.

715
00:36:52,540 --> 00:37:01,010

716
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:05,990
And sure enough, now we
don't have anything.

717
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,730
But that's OK right now,
because I don't have us

718
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,730
plugged into the network
right yet.

719
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,720
So now we've got all
of our data.

720
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,240
Everything works right, but
we're trying to pull

721
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,600
everything from our
local machine,

722
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,900
we don't have anything.

723
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,050
So let's try it again.

724
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,330
I'm going to close the window.

725
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,480
Actually, I'm going to
join a network first.

726
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,120
I'm going to be a little bit
brave, I'm going to try it on

727
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,600
wireless first.

728
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,890
Think we can get it
working today?

729
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:40,130

730
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,050
All right, so close
this window.

731
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:48,180

732
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,880
And so it's fair enough,
now we've got our data.

733
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,340
So we've got everything in
there, and I'm going to go

734
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,590
turn Wi-Fi off again.

735
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,660

736
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,210
So now because I've turned the
Wi-Fi off, if we try and go

737
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:10,530
get everything from the
server it should work.

738
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:18,860
So close this guy out, start it
again, refactored, and sure

739
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,500
enough we have everything
back again.

740
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,940
Now if I were to go and try this
on another computer that

741
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,230
I'm signed into, all of the
things that I've read are

742
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,520
going to be synced across
the different computers.

743
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,010
Now it's going to have to go and
pull that data down on the

744
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:37,880
second computer, but the key
point being it knows what I've

745
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,700
read, knows what I've starred,
it knows what I like.

746
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:46,070
So I'm able to store specific
sets of information about what

747
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,730
I'm really interested in, or how
I want to go and do these

748
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,765
things, across different
places.

749
00:38:51,765 --> 00:39:02,260

750
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,730
Keeping the application up to
date is also really useful.

751
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,670
It would be nice if when I
first started the app it

752
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,805
didn't have to go and download
all the stuff and say all

753
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:18,230
right that first time, but
instead it just always stayed

754
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,000
up to date.

755
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,660
So that the first time I started
it, or that first time

756
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,840
I opened it after not using it
for two days, all of my data's

757
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,650
there, right?

758
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,790
You go to Google+, wouldn't it
be nice if that first time it

759
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,190
loaded it was all fresh data
instead of going oh, now I got

760
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,800
to wait for it to load, do ta
do ta do, OK, now I can see

761
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,270
what I want.

762
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,820
We want that ability so that
when users start the

763
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,480
application, users want
that fast, fast.

764
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,390
They want &mdash;

765
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,340
there's something else, like a
different app that's just as

766
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,620
good but theirs is faster,
they're going to go use the

767
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,660
faster app.

768
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,570
They're going to use somebody
else's app.

769
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,930
So we want to make sure your
apps are nice and snappy, your

770
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,490
apps are nice and fast.

771
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,840
So there's this new
Chrome.alarms API, and it

772
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,920
works very similarly to set
time out or set interval.

773
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,640
It's got three &mdash;

774
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,480
I guess it's got three, I
thought it had four &mdash;

775
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,080
it's got three different
settings on it.

776
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,530
One, Delay, so you can say hey,
from the time you fire

777
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:24,060
this event, I want you to wait
five minutes and then fire.

778
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,170
It's got a Period, which is very
similar to set interval,

779
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,030
and it's going to fire
every X minutes.

780
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,900
And then finally there's a
When that's like for a

781
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,230
specific time.

782
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,690
Now for alarms, to use that,
again we need to turn on a

783
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,980
specific permission.

784
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,000
So we're going to say hey, we
need that alarms permission.

785
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,810
And then we go and
create an alarm.

786
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,790
We give it a name, and we give
it a particular property.

787
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,290
So whether we want it to fire
in a period of minutes,

788
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,150
whether we want to fire
it in a delay,

789
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,160
or a when, or whatever.

790
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,480
So in this particular case,
we're going to use a period in

791
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,080
five minutes, which is
going to fire the

792
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,380
event every five minutes.

793
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:14,070
Now, remember one of the things
that I said earlier was

794
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:19,060
that it's really important that
these apps really work

795
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,780
seamlessly and not cause
a lot of headache or

796
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,480
anything like that.

797
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,490
So we don't want to have
functions that are sitting

798
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,100
there looping.

799
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,650
We want everything to
be event-based.

800
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,510
So because this is an event,
we need to create

801
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,150
an add event listener.

802
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,040
So we're going to add
our event listener.

803
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,230
So I'm going to go and I'm just
going to &mdash; in fact, we'll

804
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,270
pop this into our application.

805
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,910

806
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,550
And I'm going to
put this into &mdash;

807
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,920
not that background &mdash;

808
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,600
and I'm just going to close a
couple of these so that we can

809
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,890
actually see where we are.

810
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,900

811
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,280
I've put in a place where I want
to put my background, so

812
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,760
I'm going to add my listener.

813
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,120
Let's make that a
little prettier.

814
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,130
And the other thing we need
to do is start our alarm.

815
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,500
Now I've already added the
alarms permission, so we don't

816
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,750
need to go add that.

817
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,490

818
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,930
Pop that in, now the app will
stay up to date and everything

819
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,180
will fire every five minutes.

820
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:26,720
Now, I probably should have
picked a blog feed that was

821
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,110
posting more than every five
minutes, or probably posting

822
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,760
once a day right now because
of I/O. But you can imagine

823
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,840
for something like this where
you've got something that you

824
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,510
want to keep up to date, maybe
a friend's feed, or maybe

825
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:43,620
something from Twitter, or any
other API that's changing on a

826
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,260
regular basis, you want that
to fire much more quickly.

827
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:57,070

828
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,540
So there's a bunch of other new
functionality in APIs that

829
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,600
are available to us that
are pretty slick.

830
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,935
Some of them didn't really fit
into the app all that well.

831
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:15,070

832
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,520
Because of the way the app was
written, they didn't really

833
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,610
fit all that well.

834
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,890
They were one of those things
where it's like ah, OK, well

835
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,920
this wasn't really particularly
needed.

836
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,750
But I still thought they were
really cool and definitely

837
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,000
worth talking about.

838
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,930

839
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,490
There's a new Identity API
that's available that allows

840
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,460
you to have your application
automatically

841
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,630
log into Google services.

842
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,450
So the user says hey, I want to
log in to this particular

843
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,460
Google service.

844
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,740
This is really for making it
easy so that you can get

845
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,110
things up to drive, or if you
want to access any of the

846
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,760
other APIs that Google
has to offer.

847
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,080
So there's a couple of things
that we need do here in

848
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,530
order to use it.

849
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:03,750
First thing you need to do, add
that identity permission.

850
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:09,980
And then we create a new block
within the manifest file, and

851
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:15,560
we say OAuth 2.0 so it uses
the OAuth 2.0 protocol, I

852
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,330
guess it is.

853
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,070
And we go in and we provide
a client ID.

854
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:27,030
So you get your client ID
from the dev console, so

855
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,170
code.google.com/API/console.

856
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,280
You get your client ID from
there, and then you specify

857
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,120
the scopes that you want
to get access to.

858
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:42,350
Much like you do if you're
writing any kind of other web

859
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,320
app that uses OAuth.

860
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,090
We take all that complexity, all
that pain in the butt &mdash; if

861
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:50,240
you've ever done OAuth 2.0,
it's definitely at least

862
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,770
easier than OAuth 1.0, but it's
still not exactly the

863
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,830
most fun thing to do.

864
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,020
And we simplify it for
you all in here.

865
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,790
So we'll ask the user to sign
in, yep, great, here you go.

866
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,970
And then you don't ever have
to worry about it again,

867
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:09,220
because all those requests that
you make will be done

868
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,470
with the right set
of permissions.

869
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:15,100

870
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,030
And then there's also when
you need to go get the

871
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,730
authentication token, there's
just a simple API that you

872
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,750
call and say hey, go
get me that token.

873
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:27,470
All right, we're good to go,
we can start doing things.

874
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:33,060
One of the ways that I wanted
to use this and see myself

875
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:38,410
using this for in the future,
is if you wanted to build an

876
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:44,340
offline RSS reader that actually
grabs the user's feed

877
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,470
from Google Reader, you could
use exactly this API to say

878
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,620
all right, let's go authenticate
the user.

879
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,800
Now we can go and get their feed
information, figure out

880
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,350
what they're reading and
pull it in that way.

881
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:59,550
So that way instead of having to
go deal with anything else,

882
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,940
we're golden.

883
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,240
We can just, sweet, don't have
to write anything crazy in

884
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,920
order to do that.

885
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,130
There's a bunch of other stuff
that I think is pretty slick.

886
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,860
Context menus, like real apps.

887
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,540
If I've got an app that's
installed on my computer, I

888
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,540
expect to be able to right-click
on it and pull up

889
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,910
a context menu.

890
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,780
Chrome apps have the ability
to say hey, I

891
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,900
want a context menu.

892
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,750
So through Chrome context
menus create, you

893
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,670
can go and do that.

894
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,590
All of these &mdash;

895
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,640
don't worry about writing any
of these down if you can't

896
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,220
really read it all that well.

897
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,780
You can go check the slides
later, or have a look at some

898
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,590
of the docs &mdash;

899
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,440
create windows.

900
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,350
Apps should be able to create
as many windows as often as

901
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:48,260
they want without being spammy
or annoying, but

902
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,570
real apps can do that.

903
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,990
We're kind of prevented from
doing that on the web.

904
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,920
For a good reason most
of the time.

905
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,320
But we just say create a
window, provide a URL &mdash;

906
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,720
that URL is a local URL.

907
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,960
We can't say open a URL to HTTP
whack whack Google, or

908
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,720
whack whack whatever,
it has to be a

909
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,080
file within our package.

910
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,280
We've got great stuff for doing
window manipulation.

911
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,270
So I can go and set
focus on a window.

912
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:18,750
I could say this window should
be in focus right now, or

913
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,960
minimize and maximize windows.

914
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,870
Just like you can with regular
applications that

915
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:25,950
the user has installed.

916
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,980
They're used to having app do
that, like hey, this app, I

917
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,440
want you to go away because
I'm not really

918
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,350
using you right now.

919
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,330
Great, done.

920
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,380
We can have them restore, move
and resize, just like we can

921
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,195
with regular installed
applications.

922
00:47:40,195 --> 00:47:43,170

923
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,440
One of the ones that
I think is kind of

924
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,920
cool, text to speech.

925
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,570
So you can have your apps
start talking to you.

926
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,270
There's even one that'll listen
for what you say, so

927
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,993
there's a speech recognition.

928
00:47:54,993 --> 00:47:59,170
Hmm, speech recognition plus a
little text speech, you could

929
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,070
start writing your
own kind of fun &mdash;

930
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,630
anyway, you can figure out where
we're going on that one,

931
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,650
or where I think you should
go on that one.

932
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,200
There's a couple other API
changes that I want to call

933
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,140
out because I think they're
pretty important.

934
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,085
Links.

935
00:48:15,085 --> 00:48:17,920
When we're used to writing web
apps, we put links in our

936
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,320
apps, right?

937
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,840
Like, you've got a link that
goes to here, you've got a

938
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,630
link that goes to there.

939
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:26,580
Links will open in a new Chrome
window if they go to

940
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,470
somewhere external.

941
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,960
So keep that in mind.

942
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,855
That like hey, if you put a
link to HTTP whack whack

943
00:48:32,855 --> 00:48:35,780
Google.com, it's going to go and
open up a browser window.

944
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,620
It's not going to
open up within

945
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,980
your application window.

946
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:45,370
So links to outside places will
open in a new window.

947
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:49,243
By default, this one threw me
when I first did it, because I

948
00:48:49,243 --> 00:48:50,840
was like, why can't
I select anything?

949
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,090
I'm trying select something.

950
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,450

951
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,380
Think about most applications
that you have.

952
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,880
You can't go and select most
of the text on there unless

953
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,240
it's a text box.

954
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,060
So just like an installed
application, you can't select

955
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,700
the text in one of these
applications unless you

956
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:12,070
specifically say this region,
this block here, the C S S div

957
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,410
span, whatever, is selectable.

958
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,140
So by default, we say
user select is none.

959
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,320
We can't put iframes in there,
we got to use something called

960
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,940
the browser tag instead.

961
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,460
Again, that's a security
thing.

962
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,050
Think about hey, we've got this
app, this great app, and

963
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,450
we let you put an iframe in.

964
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:37,050
Or you're rendering content from
somewhere else and they

965
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,440
put an iframe in.

966
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,230
All of a sudden you've just
opened this gigantic potential

967
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,640
security vulnerability, because
other people could

968
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,160
start putting anything they want
within your application.

969
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,210
So we make it very explicit
what you can and can't put

970
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,090
into those.

971
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,740
You could create some sandboxed
iframes, and the

972
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,590
browser tag is a
sandbox thing.

973
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:02,520
If you didn't make it to Eric
and Mehi's session earlier,

974
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,350
they showed some specific
demos around that.

975
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,980
Kind of neat stuff.

976
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:16,080
Local storage and Web SQL
are also turned off.

977
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,660
Local storage is turned
off primarily

978
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,580
for performance reasons.

979
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,820
It's synchronous, so hey,
go put something

980
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,420
into the data storage.

981
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,790
OK, please wait while
I do that.

982
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,790

983
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,350
Applications should be fast.

984
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:37,750
Having synchronous things
happening is not exactly going

985
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,850
to do that.

986
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:40,600
We've also turned off Web SQL.

987
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,160
It is a deprecated API.

988
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,710
Will it ever go away
from the web?

989
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,070
Probably not, but it's
not getting the

990
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,550
attention it deserves.

991
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,750
So instead, use something like
index db, which has a pretty

992
00:50:53,750 --> 00:51:00,880
strong following right now and
it's got good browser support.

993
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,020
The FileSystem API is
another great one.

994
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,840
It allows you to store big
files on the user's file

995
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,680
system in a sandboxed
environment so you can't

996
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,600
exactly go read their resume and
their user documents file

997
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,280
or something like that.

998
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,880
Or use the storage API that I
talked about earlier, so that

999
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,370
you can go in and say hey, I
want to store something on the

1000
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,830
user's computer, I want it
synced up into the cloud, or

1001
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:28,070
maybe I just want it locally
in this one specific place.

1002
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:32,630
Most plug-ins and a number of
the Chrome extension things

1003
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:33,410
are disabled.

1004
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:39,010
So you can't go put some kind
of plug-in in your app, we

1005
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,280
stopped those from happening.

1006
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,220
We think the web can be built
without any plug-ins.

1007
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,770
You saw this morning in the
keynote, the Cirque du Soleil

1008
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,850
thing, there were no
plug-ins there.

1009
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:53,140
That was all HTML, C S S and a
bunch of divs and some images.

1010
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,660
So all that stuff can be done
without plug-ins, so let's

1011
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,670
start doing that.

1012
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,170
And finally &mdash;

1013
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:07,060
I know I'm guilty of it myself
sometime, you put in an alert

1014
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,320
or something like that
so you can do

1015
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,130
debugging modal dialogs.

1016
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,610
Users don't want
modal dialogs.

1017
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,680
So instead, use custom light
boxes, use other things so

1018
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,960
that the app can keep running.

1019
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,180
Because the one key thing
about modal dialogues is

1020
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:26,860
they're not just a modal for
what the user's doing, but

1021
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,130
they also stop the
app from running.

1022
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,255
So any of the JavaScript is just
sitting there going do da

1023
00:52:31,255 --> 00:52:35,090
do da do, we're not
doing anything.

1024
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,960
I could stand up here for three
minutes and not say

1025
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,390
anything, and it's
just as boring.

1026
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,030
So you want your app
to keep running.

1027
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,280
So what's next?

1028
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,780

1029
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,510
You could start using this and
start playing with this today

1030
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,270
to really build apps that break
out of the browser.

1031
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,100
I go back to those first
four points.

1032
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,550
They break out of the browser so
they don't have the address

1033
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:04,190
bar, so they don't look like a
browser-based application.

1034
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:09,750
Takes that power that we think
the web has, and really allows

1035
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:14,800
it to break out of there and
become a much bigger platform.

1036
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,990
The enhanced UI so that you can
control how applications

1037
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:22,140
look, how they feel, how they
open and close windows.

1038
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,490
They feel like they're
installed, that they work

1039
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,520
offline by default.

1040
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,740
This is the one I think I'm most
excited about, because it

1041
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,910
means that I can write stuff
that works offline and that

1042
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,510
people expect to work offline.

1043
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:40,460
I'm going to say, I'm going to
use it again, and some people

1044
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,120
will make fun of me.

1045
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,880
My mom doesn't expect web
apps to work offline.

1046
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,190
She's going to expect these to
work offline, so we got to

1047
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,990
start building them this way.

1048
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:53,160
And finally, really takes
advantage of the native

1049
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,730
capabilities through new APIs.

1050
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,600
I didn't get into it at all in
this session, but you should

1051
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,720
drop by the Chrome
booth afterwards.

1052
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,660
We actually have taken one of
these new packaged apps, used

1053
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,870
the Bluetooth API through this
packaged app, and we're

1054
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,320
controlling a LEGO Mindstorm
robot with it.

1055
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,210
So you've got access to
Bluetooth, USB, TCP, UDP.

1056
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:20,070
You've got great access to truly
the device that these

1057
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,630
applications are running on.

1058
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,590
But most importantly, you can
start testing this today.

1059
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:29,560
Go install the Chrome Canary
build and start playing,

1060
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,400
because there's a lot of
great stuff there.

1061
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,210
There's a bunch of really good
resources if you're looking to

1062
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,930
get started in this.

1063
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,740
The Chrome packaged apps
documentation, the URLs there,

1064
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,520
these slides will go up
online momentarily.

1065
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,500
But if you go to
developers.google.com/chrome,

1066
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,820
all of that stuff will
be linked from there.

1067
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,700
If you've got questions, you're
working on something

1068
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,900
and you're like why isn't
this working?

1069
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,620
Send an email to the
Chromium-Apps Mailing List.

1070
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,570
We all have a whole bunch of
great sample applications, so

1071
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:06,740
you can see how some of these
applications were built.

1072
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,770
And finally, the last one that
I put up on there because I

1073
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:11,200
thought it was really useful.

1074
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,850
Mike West, who's at the back
of the room, wrote a

1075
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,560
wonderfully fantastic
article that is an

1076
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,300
introduction to CSP.

1077
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,150
I gave you sort of a taste of
it today, but he goes into a

1078
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:26,600
lot more depth, additional
things it's useful for.

1079
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,550
And if you're going to use it
in a website, how you can go

1080
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,330
and adjust some of the different
permissions to

1081
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,160
restrict or loosen things
for websites.

1082
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,650
You can't change them in a
Chrome packaged app, but you

1083
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,740
can change them on the web.

1084
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,690
With that, I want to say thank
you guys very much for coming

1085
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:47,980
and sticking with me.

1086
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:53,090
I hope this was somewhat
interesting for you.

1087
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,170
The link to the slides is up
there, you could see it,

1088
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:59,850
goo.gl/5krvb.

1089
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,170
The slides are up there now.

1090
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,740
I'll say thank you,
I'll open it up

1091
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,990
to any of your questions.

1092
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:11,916

1093
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:15,965
AUDIENCE: So how would I put
Analytics into an app?

1094
00:56:15,965 --> 00:56:17,420
PETE LEPAGE: That's
a great question.

1095
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,750
So the question, I guess I
don't need to repeat them

1096
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,090
because we have microphones.

1097
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:25,360
We are working on an Analytics
API that will allow you to go

1098
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,640
and do that so that you can
just say hey, here's my

1099
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:34,990
Analytics UA string, and here's
the things I want to

1100
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:35,830
[? apply. ?]

1101
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,350
We're not ready with it yet, but
it will be coming at some

1102
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,462
point in the near future.

1103
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,822
AUDIENCE: Could I copy
the Analytics js

1104
00:56:41,822 --> 00:56:43,240
files and package them?

1105
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,710
PETE LEPAGE: So the question
was, can I copy the Analytics

1106
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,760
js files and include them
in your package?

1107
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,490
You could try.

1108
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,230
My guess is it probably
won't work, I

1109
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,480
haven't tried it myself.

1110
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,670

1111
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,690
It uses cookies, so
the answer is no.

1112
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:57,940
There you go.

1113
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,174

1114
00:57:00,174 --> 00:57:02,590
AUDIENCE: Is this stuff going
to work on Chrome

1115
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:03,980
for Android and iOS?

1116
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:08,370
PETE LEPAGE: So Chrome for
Android, Chrome for iOS, it's

1117
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:10,060
something we're definitely
thinking about.

1118
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,290
I think as Sundar said this
morning, it's something we

1119
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:14,165
want to bring there, it's
not there today.

1120
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:17,430

1121
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:21,940
I want it just as soon as you
guys do, because hey, if I can

1122
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,640
write an app and have it work
everywhere, I'm a happy guy.

1123
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,490

1124
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,890
AUDIENCE: When can I write
my Chrome app in Dart?

1125
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,900
PETE LEPAGE: When can you write
your Chrome app in Dart?

1126
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:40,760
I believe you can write your
Chrome app in Dart today.

1127
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,490
I'll give you two answers.

1128
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,020
One, you can write it in Dart
today, compile it down to

1129
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,420
JavaScript, done, you
can publish today.

1130
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,600
In Dart, I'm not sure how close
the Dartium browser is

1131
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,140
staying to the Chrome
dev channel.

1132
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,400
So whenever those guys are close
to whatever we have in

1133
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,880
dev today is then.

1134
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,083
AUDIENCE: The Manifest
by JSON had a

1135
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:08,418
JavaScript function call?

1136
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:11,480
PETE LEPAGE: Yes, so that's
a good question.

1137
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,826
I don't have an answer
to that.

1138
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:15,060
Do either of you guys
know offhand?

1139
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,868
MALE SPEAKER: Right now
they [INAUDIBLE].

1140
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:24,570

1141
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:28,980
PETE LEPAGE: So right now
JavaScript only, but it is

1142
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:31,040
something that potentially
is coming?

1143
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,020
Is &mdash;

1144
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,620
yeah, well.

1145
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:38,466
So Mehi is one of
the developers.

1146
00:58:38,466 --> 00:58:41,190
MEHI: Hi, I'm one of the
engineers on Chrome apps.

1147
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:46,210
So these APIs have a language
agnostic binding system, and

1148
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,870
the goal is to expose them
to Dart Native Client and

1149
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:49,880
JavaScript.

1150
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,830
Right now only the JavaScript
part is implemented, but

1151
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,380
coming soon those other two.

1152
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,302

1153
00:58:57,302 --> 00:58:58,180
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

1154
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,430
Any other questions?

1155
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:02,490

1156
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,860
All right, well that's
the way to finish.

1157
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,400
I'm sorry, I'm going to let
you out a minute and 20

1158
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,640
seconds early, I hope
you don't mind.

1159
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,590
Thanks guys, have a great
day, have a great I/O.

1160
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,388
