1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,090
Hey there.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,660
I'm Addy Osmani.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,720
I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer on the

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,000
Chrome team at Google.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,520
And today we're going to talk
about some new Chrome DevTools

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,620
features spanning work
spaces, snippets,

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,800
and an improved Sass.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,830
Debugging workflow.

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,220
Now, these features are going to
hopefully help improve your

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,200
authoring and productivity
in the tools, so

12
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,550
let's dive right in.

13
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,140
A typical web app development
workflow usually involves a

14
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,870
clever window arrangement of
having your editor and the

15
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,509
browser with your dev tools
living side by side, and

16
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,230
constantly making this sort of
cumbersome context switch

17
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,710
between these tools.

18
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,410
Now, rather than having to do
that, wouldn't it be great if

19
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,430
you could spend a little bit
more of that time that you're

20
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,215
editing files on directly inside
the dev tools, so that

21
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,550
you could both debug and edit
your project files?

22
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,690
Now I'm going to talk about
Workspaces, which is a new

23
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,750
feature we've been able to
facilitate this workflow.

24
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,920
So, I currently have an
application open that's sort

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,610
of a page level right now.

26
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,640
And what I want to do is
actually be able to go and

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,340
open up and edit my entire
project, so everything that

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,280
makes up this project on
my local file system.

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,150
And the way I'm going to do that
is I'm going to go and

30
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm going to add this
application &mdash;

31
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,550
HTML5 Please &mdash;

32
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,775
locally.

33
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,940
You should now be able to see
that I have two sets of

34
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,400
directories.

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,730
I have my page level view of
this page, and then my entire

36
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,950
project level view.

37
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,380
And I want to be able to
consolidate these, so whenever

38
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,190
I make a change, they apply to
both what Chrome is able to

39
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,790
display and what I'm able to
experience during debugging,

40
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,820
and the changes I'm making to
my original source files.

41
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,700
So I'm going to go and I'm going
to right click on any

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,170
file, really, inside
my project.

43
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,680
I'm going to go and I'm
going to map them

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,015
to file system resource.

45
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,740
And I'm just going to choose
the option which basically

46
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,610
maps it back to the original
source file.

47
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,980
Chrome DevTools is going
to ask me to restart.

48
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,280
It's gone and it's done that.

49
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,670
And now you see I just
have one single view.

50
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,380
This one view consolidates
everything, and it basically

51
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,640
represents my entire project,
and all the files that make up

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,440
my whole application.

53
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,650
And I can go and I can edit.

54
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,250
I can edit my index file.

55
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,540
I can edit any of
my build files.

56
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,800
I can go and I can edit
my JavaScript.

57
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,030
And the first thing I want to do
is I want to make sure that

58
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,010
in this new workspace world,
I'm still able to do things

59
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,540
like live edit and life debug,
and use my breakpoints.

60
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,070
So let's do that.

61
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,390
I want to locate a specific
method called updatesearch.

62
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,890
And I'm going to do that using
a keyboard shortcut called

63
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,490
Command-Shift-O. And it's called
updatesearch, so I've

64
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,210
typed that in.

65
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,520
It's is gone and it's
taken me there.

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,330
And what I'm now going to do
is I want to change this

67
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,270
application so that &mdash;

68
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,460
so the current way this works
is I type in a tag.

69
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,080
So it can be video,
audio, canvas, or

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,590
another HTML5 feature.

71
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,920
And this page will basically let
me know whether it's safe

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,900
or not to use that feature.

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,190
What I want is, whenever I type
into the search field, I

74
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,770
basically want it to
log to the console.

75
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,140
So I'm going to add a little
console log statement here.

76
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,825
I'm going to say,
console.log("We're

77
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:56,075
updating!").

78
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,250

79
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,650
And I'm going to do Command
Save, just to save that back.

80
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,130
And using the Escape shortcut
key, I'm going to open up a

81
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,176
local console which can be
displayed at the same time as

82
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,680
the Sources panel, so
I can see my output.

83
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,060
What I now want to see is
whatever I type in something,

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,990
as you can see, that's logging
correctly to the console,

85
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,690
which is great.

86
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,410
So I know that live editing
seems to be working fine.

87
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,420
The next thing I want to be
able to do is work with

88
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,350
breakpoints.

89
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,810
So we can still use updatesearch
for this.

90
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,490
Let me add a breakpoint to
classList, and I can do this

91
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,430
by clicking inside the
line number gutter.

92
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,030
And I can do that inside a few
other places in my code.

93
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,225
And what I'm now going to do is
basically go back to here

94
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:43,140
and start typing it again.

95
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,340
And the first thing you'll
notice is that it's triggered

96
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,910
that first breakpoint.

97
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,040
And I can go and I can continue
on to the next

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,070
breakpoint just by right
clicking inside the gutter,

99
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,410
and clicking on the next one
and going to continue here,

100
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,870
which will continue execution
up to that point.

101
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,170
And I can continue to the
next one right after

102
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,260
that if I want to.

103
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,730
So let's kill the stuff
that we had in console

104
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,580
there at the moment.

105
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,730
Now, something that I noticed
with workspace that's actually

106
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,220
pretty cool is the ability
for DevTools &mdash;

107
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,230
let me show you this.

108
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,140
I'm going to come to close
my script file.

109
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,130
I'm going to close
the DevTools.

110
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,680
So let's assume that we've
restarted Chrome.

111
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,740
I'm going to open up my Sources
panel once again.

112
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,230
And I'm going to go back to
script.js, which is what we

113
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,650
were working on.

114
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,140
And what you'll now see is that
all those breakpoints

115
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,390
that I created are actually
still there.

116
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,740
The DevTools have been able
to remember them.

117
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,690
And it can do that for
any number of files.

118
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,930
I can have a bunch of different
scripts that are

119
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,470
composing my application, and
it'll basically remember the

120
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,870
different breakpoint
settings for them.

121
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,330
I can actually go and &mdash;

122
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,870
I can still add things
like conditional

123
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,710
breakpoints as well.

124
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,960
So here, what I want to do
is say, if the value of

125
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,160
search.value is panda, for
example, I basically want it

126
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,830
to trigger this breakpoint.

127
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,055
So I can type in audio
and nothing happens.

128
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,670
But I type in panda, and it's
triggered that conditional

129
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,740
breakpoint.

130
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,820
I can actually &mdash; so let's
continue working through

131
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,440
there, and let's get rid of that
conditional breakpoint.

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,610
And let's take a look at
our watch expressions.

133
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,730
So I can still add things
like objects to my watch

134
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,960
expressions and have those been

135
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,850
watched during my workflow.

136
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,980
So pretty much everything works
the same way that you'd

137
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,410
expect it to.

138
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,430
Now if we're saying that you're
getting a slightly

139
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,990
better editing experience inside
the DevTools, one thing

140
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,020
that we commonly need to do is
have access to some sort of

141
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,460
revision history.

142
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,460
Now, you actually get access to
this by right clicking on

143
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,180
any file, going to the Context
menu, and then clicking on

144
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,890
Local Modifications.

145
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,500
What this will do is &mdash; and let's
make some modifications.

146
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,900
Let's say, var test equals
some object.

147
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,700
Let's save that.

148
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,490
And what you can see is that
I get a complete revision

149
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,570
history where I can go and
revert back all the changes

150
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,530
that I've made up to
a certain point.

151
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,050
I can apply a specific change
at a particular

152
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,940
timestamp if I want.

153
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,550
Or I can apply a specific
revision to my original files.

154
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,560
And this is really useful.

155
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,140
So rather than having to just
sort of worry that a change

156
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,540
that I'm making during my live
editing and debugging workflow

157
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,710
is going to come back to bite
me later, I can easily trust

158
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,730
local modifications to
save those changes.

159
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,840
And I can go and I can revert
back to them if needed.

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,630
So I'm to go and I'm going
to escape that.

161
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,910
Now, you can actually get some
nice mileage using some of the

162
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,310
other buttons that are at the
bottom of the Sources panel.

163
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,080
So let's take a look
at some of those.

164
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,810
Now, it's quite common when
you're working on an

165
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,460
application of some
sort to have a few

166
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,640
tiles that are minified.

167
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,170
And these may be outside of
your own build process.

168
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,020
So maybe it's like a minified
version of jQuery or Backbone

169
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,160
or something else, and you just
want to make it a little

170
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,930
bit more readable, because the
minified form of this file is

171
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,510
this is just not that
easy to work with.

172
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,702
So using the curly braces button
at the very bottom,

173
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,620
this one that says "pretty
print," I can click on that.

174
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,190
And it'll go and it'll beautify
my JavaScript for me.

175
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,410
So I can go &mdash; and this is a
little bit more easy to read.

176
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,490
It's much more neatly
white spaced out.

177
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,740
It's a lot more easy for me
to go Through And I can

178
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,880
go and I can use &mdash;

179
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,170
although some of these variable
names are going to be

180
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,220
minified, I can actually mostly
still use my same

181
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,670
shortcut for displaying all
of these methods to access

182
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,160
things, which is great.

183
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,980
Now, if you're working on a
project which has really any

184
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,760
number of large files on it,
you're going to want to be

185
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,190
able to easily locate things,
whether it be inside a

186
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,180
specific file, or across
your entire project.

187
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,470
Now, there are some useful
keyboard shortcuts which can

188
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,760
help you achieve this, and I'm
going to go through some of

189
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,990
them right now.

190
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,290
So we've already gone through
one of them, which is finding

191
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,100
a method in a specific file.

192
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,820
So for any of the shortcuts I'm
going to go through, I'll

193
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,770
probably be using
the Mac specific

194
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,430
version, which uses Command.

195
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,820
But if you're on Windows or
you're on Linux, you can use

196
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,690
Control instead of Command to
achieve the exact same thing.

197
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,500
So if I want to locate a
specific method inside a file,

198
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,980
I want to filter down to a
specific method &mdash; or in the

199
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,260
case of a style sheet,
a specific property &mdash;

200
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,660
I can use Command-Shift-O. And
like earlier, I can filter

201
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,120
down to updatesearch.

202
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,270
I can filter down to pretty
much any method I want.

203
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,620
And by clicking on it, it will
take me to the line number

204
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,150
where that method or function
exists, which is great.

205
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,890
Another thing I might want to
be able to do is open or

206
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,950
filter the list of
files that are

207
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,040
available inside a project.

208
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,740
And I can do that with
Command-O. So this will go and

209
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,440
it will display all the
different files that I have

210
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,160
available to me.

211
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,600
If I'm looking for my style
file, I can start typing.

212
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,990
And as you can see, it's
filtered down the list to

213
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,510
those results that are
relevant to me.

214
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,770
If I'm looking for all of my
JavaScript files, I can just

215
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,059
type in .js and achieve the
exact same thing, which is,

216
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,940
again, quite helpful.

217
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,390
Now, if I want to navigate to
a specific line that I know

218
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,310
exists inside my file, you can
use Command-L to achieve this.

219
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,280
So here, I'm going to go
to line number 56.

220
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,480
And as I can see, I'm in the
region of my updatesearch

221
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,330
method once again, which
is really great.

222
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,910
Now, some of the different
panels inside the DevTools

223
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,710
have their own find feature,
which works at a context level

224
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,070
on the material that
you're working on.

225
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,830
So in the case of the Sources
panel, Command-F will bring up

226
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,850
a nice little search box in
the very bottom, near the

227
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,030
Sources toolbar at the very
bottom of the screen.

228
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,840
And I can start typing
in here to look at

229
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,090
things inside this file.

230
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,060
So I can find my updatesearch
once again using this.

231
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,410
I can find specific variable
names, or pretty much anything

232
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,230
that I want.

233
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,290
And I can use these navigation
toggles to go back and forth

234
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,370
between different
search results.

235
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,330
I can actually also go and find
and replace different

236
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,870
content if I want to, the same
way that I would in a normal

237
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,810
text editor, which
can be useful.

238
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,970
And this type of functionality
is present on a few different

239
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,260
panels, including Network, and
I believe Resources as well.

240
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,380
So if you're using those panels,
you can also use

241
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,680
Command-F on them.

242
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,385
Typically, we also need to be
able to search across all of

243
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,000
the files that form
our project.

244
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,420
And we can do this using another
keyboard shortcut,

245
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,820
which is Command-Option-F.
What this gives me is the

246
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,470
ability to look across every
single file in my project.

247
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,180
So let me look for something
like document.

248
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,200
I want to see what files in this
project on use the word

249
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,520
document in them.

250
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,960
And as you can see, it's giving
me a list of all the

251
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,240
different files, as well as the
line numbers where these

252
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
occurrences are.

253
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,380
And I can go and I can
click on any result.

254
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,520
It'll actually open
it up inside the

255
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,550
Source panel editor.

256
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,685
And I can go and I can make
any changes that I want to

257
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:29,220
those files quite easily.

258
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,040
So you can expend any of these
search results and it'll give

259
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,820
you a preview of where it's
found, the instance of what

260
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,970
you've been looking for.

261
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,290
And this feature also supports
some nice things like regular

262
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,660
expressions, if you
want to use those.

263
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,475
So let's hit escape again
to kill the console.

264
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,740
Now that's great.

265
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,070
I'm able to pretty
much edit files

266
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,610
directly inside the DevTools.

267
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,800
I can load up local projects,
entire projects, so I can see

268
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,930
all the different files.

269
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,990
And if I close Chrome or close
the DevTools, that project, as

270
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,510
long as I want it to be, will
still be around, so I don't

271
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,690
have to go manually opening up
any individual files that I

272
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,980
want to debug or edit.

273
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,540
That's great.

274
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,790
Now, if you'd like to start
using Workspaces today, the

275
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,620
first thing you're going to need
to do is make sure you're

276
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,960
using Google Chrome Canary, so
the Canary release channel.

277
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,650
The next thing you want to do is
go to About Flags, and look

278
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,260
for the Developer Tools
experiments.

279
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,770
So I'm looking for
Developer Tools.

280
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,260
And you just want to make sure
that you enable developer

281
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,840
Tools experiments, and
then relaunch Chrome.

282
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,140
The next thing you want to do
is go to the Settings pane

283
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,150
once you're fired up DevTools.

284
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,750
Go to Experiments, and Enable
File System Folders in Sources

285
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,350
Panel, so this option that
I have open right here.

286
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,200
You then need to relaunch
your Developer Tools.

287
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,870
And you'll get access to a new
feature called Workspace that

288
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,200
appears as a tab.

289
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,850
And you can then go and add as
many different file systems as

290
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,460
you want, and you even have
some configuration options

291
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,050
around the different file
mappings that are also set.

292
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,690
And that's it.

293
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,470
You should be able to work with
projects directly inside

294
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,060
the tools, which can be nice.

295
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,720
Sometimes you want to be able
to save smaller scripts,

296
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,200
utilities, and bookmarklets so
that they're always available

297
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,890
to you inside the DevTools.

298
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,080
There's a new feature
that can help you

299
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,830
with this called snippets.

300
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,260
So to use snippets, go
to the Sources panel.

301
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,040
And in the left hand Nav, find
the snippets sub-bar.

302
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,320
Now in the tree view here, you
can see that I already have

303
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,240
some snippets that I
created earlier.

304
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,730
To create a brand new snippet,
right click inside the Tree

305
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,490
View and hit New.

306
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,720
You can then customize the name
of your snippet to be

307
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,430
pretty much whatever you want.

308
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,000
In my case, I'm going to
call it cornify.js.

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,640
You can then paste in the
contents of a bookmarklet, or

310
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,560
write any custom script that you
want to form your snippet.

311
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,460
In my case, I'm going to paste
in my cornify script.

312
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,620
And I can then run this against
any local object if I

313
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,350
want &mdash; the Window, the
Navigator, and so on &mdash;

314
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,700
but I'll mostly be using this
against the current page.

315
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,710
Now, there are two ways you
can execute a snippet.

316
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,040
You can either use the
triangular button at the very

317
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,210
bottom of the Sources bar, which
will basically go and

318
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,380
run it, or you can use
the keyboard shortcut

319
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,640
Control-Shift-E, which will
also do the same thing.

320
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,490
So in our case, we're
going to use

321
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,940
Control-Shift-E, run my snippet.

322
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,570
And what you can see is it's
gone and it's added a really,

323
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,260
really awesome rainbow
to my page.

324
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,810
I can go and I can run
this once again.

325
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,300
Boom!

326
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,760
I've got a unicorn.

327
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,410
This page is so much more
functional now.

328
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,350
And that's great.

329
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,710
As you can see, I can actually
go to any script here.

330
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,610
So I can go to CSS Prettifier,
which I'll be

331
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,860
showing you in a moment.

332
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,150
But I can add breakpoints
to this page.

333
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,730
I can treat this as pretty
much any normal script.

334
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,380
I can live edit it.

335
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,400
I can live debug it.

336
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,020
And that's great.

337
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,730
Another nice thing about this
feature is it basically gives

338
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,700
you access to a lovely multiline
console with both

339
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,000
syntax highlighting
and persistence.

340
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,620
So you can basically go and
do anything you want.

341
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,220
And hit to the next line, keep
editing this the same way that

342
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,870
you would any other script,
which is great.

343
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,190
Now, to show you another example
of a bookmarklet, I

344
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,880
created CSS Prettifier.

345
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,790
And I'm currently on a page &mdash;
so normally when you're view

346
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,260
sourcing a page, you might be
trying to check out the

347
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,540
JavaScript on that page,
and the CSS.

348
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,630
And when you try going and
looking at the raw version of

349
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,100
that, it's not very easy
to do that always.

350
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,530
Because sometimes those style
sheets might be minified and

351
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,330
those scripts might
be minified too.

352
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,280
So in this case, what I'm
going to do with CSS

353
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,360
Prettifier is I'm just going
to go and I'm going to run

354
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,660
this against the current page.

355
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,500
And as you can see, it's gone
and it's prettified my CSS,

356
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,320
making it much more readable,
much more accessible to me,

357
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,790
which is great.

358
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,640
So snippets have got a
lot of capabilities.

359
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,300
You can use all the same panels
as you would for your

360
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,900
debugging and editing workflows,
as we were looking

361
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,510
at earlier with Workspaces.

362
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,820
And to enable them and start
using snippets today, all you

363
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,600
need to do is go to the settings
cog, go back to

364
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,400
Experiments, and just check
Snippets Support.

365
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,990
Now, at the current time,
snippets are still in

366
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,530
experimental.

367
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,260
We're expecting for them
to sort of come out of

368
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,610
experiments quite soon, so you
may not even need to enable

369
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,760
them in the future, and
that's the hope.

370
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,050
So we've looked at Workspaces.

371
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,220
We've looked at snippets.

372
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,010
The next thing we're going to
look at is an improved Sass

373
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,240
debugging workflow inside
the DevTools.

374
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,460
If you enjoy working with an
abstraction language like

375
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,140
Sass, your workflow inside the
DevTools has probably been a

376
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,160
little bit limited.

377
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,570
The reason is, although you
can edit CSS inside the

378
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,110
sources panel or via the
Elements panel, none of the

379
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,970
changes that you make will
actually go and be propagated

380
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,690
back to your original
Sass source files.

381
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,640
And that means that as soon as
you run the Sass compiler, any

382
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,050
changes made to your CSS from
the DevTools will be

383
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,170
overwritten.

384
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,610
That workflow changes now with
some recent improvements that

385
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,350
we've made.

386
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,570
I'm going to go over to the
Elements panel and inspecting

387
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,790
the top root of the HTML5 Please
page, I'm going to go

388
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,260
and take a look at some
of our styles.

389
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,670
So here I see background
color 232927.

390
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,830
Now I can actually command and
click into this color, and be

391
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,590
taken to the dark variable name,
which expresses what

392
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,080
this color is, which
is fantastic.

393
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,060
Going back to Elements, I can
actually also Command click on

394
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,030
background color, to be taken
to the reference where we're

395
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,200
saying, OK, we'll use the
dark variable for this

396
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,760
color, which is great.

397
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,320
I'm going to go and I'm now
going to inspect the H1 for

398
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,110
this page, so HTML5 Please.

399
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,460
And what you'll notice in this
side, is that rather than us

400
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,250
referring to style.css or just
the CSS, we're actually now

401
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,030
referring to line
numbers for the

402
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,750
original Sass source files.

403
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,380
So I can go, and by clicking on
style.css, it will actually

404
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,260
take me to line source for this
style, which is great.

405
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,710
And I can now go and
start making

406
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,060
actual changes to these.

407
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,660
I have another feature called
on which basically allows me

408
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,760
to reload whenever changes are
makes my Sass files, and I'm

409
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,020
going to preview what that
looks like right now.

410
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,580
So I now want to make
a change to one of

411
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,010
my Sass source files.

412
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,740
There's actually a Sass function
that I defined

413
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,700
earlier called OMG.

414
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,910
And I'd like to change my
text-shadow to use that

415
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,260
instead of what we've
got at the moment.

416
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,170
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go to text-shadow,

417
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,310
type in omg &mdash;

418
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,670
let's clean up some
of this stuff &mdash;

419
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,010
and I'm just going
to Command-S and

420
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,654
take a look at this.

421
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,130
Boom!

422
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,859
So what that's done is it's
actually gone and compiled my

423
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,680
Sass file into CSS, and it's
being previewed inside of the

424
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,170
Chrome without me having to go
and use any additional tools

425
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,900
separately.

426
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,280
So I do have my Sass compiler
running in the background and

427
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,240
watching everything.

428
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,750
But that's about it.

429
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,780
Now, in order to enable this
Sass editing workflow, you

430
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,290
need to go to DevTools Settings,
go to Experiments,

431
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,590
and first of all, make
sure you have

432
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,650
support for Sass checked.

433
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,780
After that, you'll probably have
to relaunch the tools.

434
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,690
Next, go to General, scroll
down, and you want to Enable

435
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,990
Source Maps, as well
as the Auto-reload

436
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,110
CSS upon Sass Save.

437
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,510
And that's what basically allows
us to reload without

438
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,100
having to go and do anything
extra like

439
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,860
refresh the page manually.

440
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,150
Finally, make sure that you're
running the Sass compile there

441
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,400
was some specific flags
in the background.

442
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,560
In this case we're using Sass,
Watch, SCSS, Sourcemap, and

443
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,270
then defining the input and
output for our files.

444
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,420
And that's it.

445
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,630
