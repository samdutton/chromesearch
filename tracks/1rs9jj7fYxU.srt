00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,109
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,740
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,680
My name is Claudio.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,030
I'm an engineer on the
Google Drive SDK

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,300
Developer Relations team.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,360
And this Eric, our
tech lead for the

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,970
documentation on the same team.

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,620
Welcome, Eric.

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,980
This is the first time
for you live.

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,540
ERIC GILMORE: Thank
you, Claudio.

12
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,140
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And today,
we want to talk about our

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,860
documentation.

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,950
We got a lot of feedback
on our documentation.

15
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,140
And Eric spent a lot of time
working through that feedback,

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,720
and he's going to share some
of the results with you.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,360
ERIC GILMORE: I hate to start
by correcting you, Claudio.

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,540
But a lot of feedback is
a slight exaggeration.

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,370
And we always want
more feedback.

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,090
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

21
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,360
ERIC GILMORE: That's why the
very first thing we're going

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,260
to show you when we switch to
this monitor is a new feature

23
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,610
in our SDK documentation, which
is this link here at the

24
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,990
upper right, which you
can use to send

25
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,360
feedback directly to me.

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,849
I'll share it with the
team, of course.

27
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,750
And we'll act on your feedback
as quickly as we can and as

28
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,970
thoroughly as we can.

29
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,310
But this right here, I'd like
to show you, is the link.

30
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,600
You can type some things,
hopefully something a little

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,980
bit more intelligible
than that.

32
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,800
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah,
and remember,

33
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,860
he is the tech writer.

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,760
So that was absolutely
meaningful.

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,240
ERIC GILMORE: And I think
this is a great feature.

36
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,250
You can actually highlight
screenshots, verbiage,

37
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,110
whatever you'd like
to talk about,

38
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,880
and submit that feedback.

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,020
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

40
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,260
What about the other button
there, the blackout?

41
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:36,425
ERIC GILMORE: Ah.

42
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:42,590
If you want to remove some
information that you would

43
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,210
like to hide from the world,
personal information about

44
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,340
yourself, pictures of your
children, your name, whatever,

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,200
you can black it
out like that.

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,160
And that is what we'll
see when you send the

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,560
feedback, like so.

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,410
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

49
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,990
ERIC GILMORE: We encourage
you to use this link.

50
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,950
Please use it.

51
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,060
We want more feedback.

52
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,490
That's really what I'm saying.

53
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,360
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
That's great.

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,520
So you said there was a
link on that top right

55
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,560
corner of the page.

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,700
Is that available everywhere?

57
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
ERIC GILMORE: That should be
available on every page,

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,030
starting from our landing page
to the deepest details in our

59
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,870
documentation, including some of
the pages that we're going

60
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,430
to talk about today,
which is here.

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,930
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

62
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,210
And that is not the only way
for people to give us

63
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,890
feedback, right?

64
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,920
If they have questions, they
also have other channels,

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,230
including Stack Overflow, which
is our main channel for

66
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:42,840
developer questions.

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,790
ERIC GILMORE: Sure.

68
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,150
And if you'd like to ask
questions about the

69
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,830
documentation or give feedback
about the documentation there

70
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,950
or in this form, either
way is terrific.

71
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,740
Just make sure that you feel
free to give us your feedback.

72
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,610
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Perfect.

73
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,020
And so I said we got
a lot of feedback.

74
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,090
Well, let's say we got
some feedback.

75
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,670
And what kind of feedback
have we got?

76
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,050
ERIC GILMORE: Well, most of or
feedback has centered around

77
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,670
the Getting Started experience
for our Drive SDK.

78
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,680
And acting on it, we've made a
few changes to this page that

79
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,010
we're demonstrating right now.

80
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,010
The main common thread in the
feedback we received on this

81
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,780
page is it was a little bit
confusing what your options

82
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,360
are for integrating
with Drive.

83
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,720
At the moment, we have basically
two levels of

84
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,890
integration.

85
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,890
One level of integration is
basic drive API access, which

86
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,890
enables you to make calls
to the API and receive--

87
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,740
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So, for
instance, whenever you want to

88
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,470
write a script or install an
application that reads your

89
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,080
file, writes files to drive,
even a web application is, of

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,650
course, fine that wants
to access your

91
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,120
files on Google Drive.

92
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,930
But you don't want your
application to show up

93
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,320
on the Drive UI.

94
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,140
And if instead you want to, you
can also get that, right?

95
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,900
ERIC GILMORE: Yes.

96
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,360
Without giving too much away,
we may have more options in

97
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,830
that general area soon.

98
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,830
But currently, there's that
level, which to get that level

99
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,240
of integration, all you need to
do is enable the drive API

100
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,380
in your API project.

101
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,430
More involved, more complete, we
think more featureful level

102
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,120
of integration is integrating
with the drive UI

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,400
and Chrome Web Store.

104
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,290
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Why would
a developer do that?

105
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,350
ERIC GILMORE: Well, a developer
might very well like

106
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,770
to have the open width and
create new behavior that we

107
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,310
provide in the Drive UI, which
is essentially what you'd find

108
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,440
in Windows or Mac file systems
where you open a document with

109
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
a particular application.

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,900
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Do we
want to show that?

111
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,210
ERIC GILMORE: I think
we might.

112
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,460
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

113
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,740

114
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,990
ERIC GILMORE: Let's
start with Create.

115
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,570

116
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,250
Here are a number of wonderful
Google formats you could use

117
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,480
to create documents, but to
create documents with

118
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,300
applications integrated with
Google Drive, you come to this

119
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,370
More option.

120
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,830
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And you
install an application first.

121
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,240
ERIC GILMORE: Ah, there
aren't any Google--

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,330
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Really?

123
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,030
Any third-party applications?

124
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,960
So maybe we want to install one
from the Chrome website?

125
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,750
ERIC GILMORE: Let's do that.

126
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,250
Great idea, Claudio.

127
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,010
Fortunately, here is the entire
collection of Drive

128
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,840
apps that we can select from.

129
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,620
What do you think, Claudio?

130
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,210
This is your account.

131
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,800
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, that's
my personal account.

132
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,230
So feel free to destroy it.

133
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,415
ERIC GILMORE: How about Loupe?

134
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:37,445
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Loupe
seems great, yeah.

135
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,830
ERIC GILMORE: OK,
sign in to add.

136
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,120
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, because
we need to sign in.

137
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,430
We opened this page
before loading.

138
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,940
Just reload the page,
and I'm signed it.

139
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,760
So now it knows that I'm me.

140
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,630
And we can actually install
an application.

141
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,830
ERIC GILMORE: At Chrome.

142
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,900
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So that's
all you need to install an

143
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,330
application.

144
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,520
Just goes to the Chrome
Web Store, just click

145
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,940
once, and that's it.

146
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,150
ERIC GILMORE: The applications
that you've installed will

147
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,340
show up in your New tab page.

148
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,470
So every time I open one of
those, I'll have the option of

149
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,320
going straight to Loupe.

150
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,980
Or where we started with
this discussion--

151
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,300
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

152
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,690
And as soon as we go back here--
so we refresh the page.

153
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,880
And we get a message
saying that an

154
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,640
application was installed.

155
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,270
And in this case, it's Loupe.

156
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:28,610
And so now, we can create
a new Loupe collage.

157
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,100
Of course, I have
to authorize it.

158
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,350
Feel free to authorize the
application on my behalf since

159
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,250
you're using my account.

160
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:33,440
ERIC GILMORE: Let's see.

161
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,790
It's not asking for anything
too particular.

162
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,120
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No, we
know this application.

163
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,400
It's very good.

164
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,670
ERIC GILMORE: We've
allowed access.

165
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,500
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
And then, you can

166
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,000
create a photo collage.

167
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,940
And that's what Loupe can do.

168
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,500
ERIC GILMORE: We don't
need to go that far.

169
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,260
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No, we can
go back to the Drive UI.

170
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,090
What about the Open-With?

171
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,610
ERIC GILMORE: Now, do you have
an image file in here?

172
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,100
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I might.

173
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,130
But even the first file, which
is a PDF, can be something

174
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,290
that I can open with
something else.

175
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,420
ERIC GILMORE: Can we open
that with Loupe?

176
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,990
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, it's
probably not confidential.

177
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,950
Not with Loupe.

178
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,840
We have Google Drive here.

179
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,320
ERIC GILMORE: This
is interesting.

180
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,720
I think you can see
pretty clearly how

181
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,940
Open-With is going to work.

182
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,210
We go to this contextual menu.

183
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,820
We select from installed
applications.

184
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,540
For this particular type of
file, our only option appears

185
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,970
to be the Google Drive Viewer.

186
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,320
But here's something that I'm
very happy to show you, is

187
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,370
when we open this file in the
Google Drive Viewer--

188
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,870
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And I'm glad
that you opened a file

189
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,790
that is not confidential.

190
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,340
It's not my private document.

191
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,520
I'm glad you did that.

192
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
ERIC GILMORE: Excellent.

193
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,550
Down here, we can actually get
a filtered list of Drive apps

194
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,280
that are capable of opening
that type of file.

195
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,400
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Can
you go back to that?

196
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,310
I didn't see it.

197
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,810
ERIC GILMORE: Sure.

198
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,880
Can we go back to it this way?

199
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Oh,
it's another topic.

200
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,420
ERIC GILMORE: We have
to do this again.

201
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,600
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, so here
you said in the bottom

202
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,580
left corner, we have a new icon
that's added that can

203
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,720
discover apps that can open
this kind of file.

204
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,310
So we, under this new feature
which checks what file you're

205
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,240
looking at, and says, well, I
can open this file with a

206
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,820
Google Drive Viewer, and
you're seeing it.

207
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,190
But if you want, there are
other applications in the

208
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,980
Chrome Web Store that can also
open the file that maybe have

209
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,220
additional functionalities.

210
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,310
And you clicked on it.

211
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,690
And then in the next stop then,
you see that there are

212
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,470
two applications in the Chrome
Web Store that can open that

213
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,890
specific kind of file.

214
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,360
And so if you want, you can
just install one and go

215
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,490
directly from there.

216
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,159
ERIC GILMORE: Now, this is one
of the reasons that you might

217
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,610
want to integrate with Chrome
Web Store and have the full UI

218
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,330
integration.

219
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,250
That's essentially an upsell on
your application that lets

220
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,440
people know that you can open
these documents with your app.

221
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,660
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Let's make it
clear because this changed

222
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,240
since Version 1 of
the Drive SDK.

223
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,830
In Version 1, you had to
integrate your application

224
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,360
with the Chrome Web Store
for it to work.

225
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,950
Now, with Version 2 of the API,
which we launched the

226
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,390
Google I/O a month ago, the
installation requirement is

227
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,940
not a requirement anymore.

228
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,840
So you can write your
application that uses the

229
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,930
Drive API, and it works.

230
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,770
But if you want some marketing
material, if you want your

231
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,140
application to be promoted in
the Chrome Web Store, you can

232
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,100
do an extra step and integrate
it with the Web Store and get

233
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,390
all these features so people can
more easily discover your

234
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:28,710
application.

235
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,610
ERIC GILMORE: Exactly.

236
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,970
So in this sense, Chrome Web
Store is a distribution and

237
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,870
marketing tool, and
a powerful one.

238
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,921
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Perfect.

239
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:40,780
Did we get any more
feedback on this

240
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,540
specific part of the page?

241
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,050
ERIC GILMORE: Well, we did get
some feedback on the Drive SDK

242
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,980
console and some confusion that
exists between the IDs

243
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,505
that you need to specify
in order to have the

244
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:55,530
full Chrome Web Store.

245
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,510
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, maybe we
can take a look at the APIs

246
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,940
console and see how
that works.

247
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,225
ERIC GILMORE: All right.

248
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:01,850
Let's have a look.

249
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,630
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So this
is still my account.

250
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,370
And this is a project I have
that is fortunately related.

251
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,830
And so in this APIs console,
we basically define our

252
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,110
project and generate the
credentials that we're going

253
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,340
to use to authorize a request.

254
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,850
So in the API Access tab, we
see that we generated some

255
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,120
credentials, and my application
is a web

256
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,750
application.

257
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,720
So what I'm using is a client ID
for web application, which

258
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,960
is that string there.

259
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,040
And then you also need a client
secret, which of course

260
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,725
now is public thanks to Eric.

261
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,980
So I'm going to revoke
it any time soon--

262
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,470
ERIC GILMORE: You'd better
revoke that quickly.

263
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,010
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: --so that
no one else can use.

264
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,290
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: We mentioned
the client ID many

265
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,500
times in our documentation.

266
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,890
So whenever we talk about client
ID in the Docs, the

267
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,760
client ID is that string there,
which is usually some

268
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,120
numerical string dot apps dot
Google user content account.

269
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,990
Don't rely on that format.

270
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,010
It is a string.

271
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,190
That's all you need to know.

272
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,350
ERIC GILMORE: And when we say
client ID, we mean this entire

273
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,280
string, including the text.

274
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,170
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yes, so the
client ID is the entire

275
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,290
string, which looks like
a URL, but it's not.

276
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,400
It's just a string.

277
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,350
It's part of your credentials.

278
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,440
There's another ID we often
mention in our docs.

279
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,090
And that is the app ID.

280
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,800
The app ID can be found
in the Drive SDK

281
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,190
top of the APIs console.

282
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,210
So in the API access, you
generate credentials for any

283
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,770
kind of applications.

284
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,700
But when you want to work, when
you want to build a Drive

285
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,900
SDK application, you also get
this extra tab, which allows

286
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,050
you to specify more features
of the same application,

287
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,220
including your icons, including
what file types your

288
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,340
application can open,
and so on.

289
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,690
And the first thing you see on
this page is the application

290
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,530
ID, or app ID, which
is just a number.

291
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,700
And it's right there
below the title.

292
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,460
ERIC GILMORE: I think the
source of some of the

293
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,500
confusion may have been that
the client ID generally

294
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,630
includes this number at the
beginning of the string, which

295
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,610
is the client ID.

296
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: But you
shouldn't rely on that.

297
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,190
So don't take the client ID,
strip some parts, and generate

298
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,170
the app ID on your own,
and things like that.

299
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,570
Any time you need to refer
to the app ID,

300
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,300
go to the APIs console.

301
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,890
And anytime you need to refer
to the client ID, go to the

302
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,250
other tab in the APIs console.

303
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,080
ERIC GILMORE: Exactly.

304
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,770
And just to remind you, that
other tab is the API Access

305
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,230
tab where you'll find
the client ID.

306
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,600
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

307
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,560
And before we close the section,
I just want to remind

308
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,180
you that in order for you to
have the Drive SDK tab in your

309
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,000
project, you have to go to the
Services tab there and enable

310
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,740
the Drive API and the
Drive SDK services.

311
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,450
So we did that in advance.

312
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,580
You will not see the Drive SDK
section until you enable that

313
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,590
here from Services.

314
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,780
So let's say you want
to create an

315
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,590
application, just to summarize.

316
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,940
First, you go to Services,
enable Drive

317
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,160
API and Drive SDK.

318
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,240
Then you go to API Access
and generate your

319
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,810
client ID in secret.

320
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,050
And then you specify the
additional parameters in the

321
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,850
Drive SDK section.

322
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,020
ERIC GILMORE: Right.

323
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,480
What Claudio has just
described is

324
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,820
detailed in this page.

325
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,330
And if you have any difficulty
with it, please hit the

326
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,530
feedback button and
let us know.

327
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,380
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

328
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,080
Yeah, we have a feedback
button now.

329
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,310
And also, we cover the
same steps in the

330
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,680
tutorials we have.

331
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,850
Because in our recommendation,
we have guides, we have the

332
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,130
reference, but we also
have tutorials.

333
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,030
ERIC GILMORE: Should we
look at those briefly?

334
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,440
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

335
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,870
ERIC GILMORE: This is one of the
most popular areas of our

336
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,010
documentation.

337
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:58,350
We're basically an end-to-end
Drive app example for any one

338
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,210
of these languages--

339
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,020
Java, Python, PHP,
Dotnet, and Ruby.

340
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,780
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And we can
say we have one for Go in the

341
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,290
works, which is almost ready.

342
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,230
We just need to make it nicer.

343
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,360
And it's going to be
published soon.

344
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,210
And all these tutorials have
a set-up section where we

345
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,600
explain basically
the same thing.

346
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,530
ERIC GILMORE: Yes.

347
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,140
Claudio, you mentioned
revoking access.

348
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,500
Do you want to actually
take care of that now?

349
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,430
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: We can
do that any time.

350
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,200
So you have two things
you can do here.

351
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,650
I actually mentioned one.

352
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,100
But we should make it
clear there are two

353
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,250
things you can do here.

354
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,400
The developer can go back
to the APIs console and

355
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,760
regenerate the client secret.

356
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,610
So right now, anyone who was
watching this video can see my

357
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,240
client ID and client secret.

358
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,740
They can copy those
credentials.

359
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,960
ERIC GILMORE: Make sure
you tell them how.

360
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,910
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah,
I'm explaining

361
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,790
how to hack my account.

362
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,450
That is going to be fun.

363
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,310
So you can take those
credentials, and you can use

364
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,000
them in your application to
behave like my application.

365
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,810
And so the developer, in this
case, has to go to the APIs

366
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,400
console, go back to the API
Access tab, and click on

367
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,320
regenerate client secret so that
the old one is not valid

368
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,680
anymore, and all the
APIs requesting to

369
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,050
use that will fail.

370
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,485
And I will be the only one
knowing it, so I will

371
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:29,100
not show it to you.

372
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,440
And I will be only one
that can use that.

373
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,170
ERIC GILMORE: Could that also
be useful for testing to

374
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,310
regenerate client IDs?

375
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,710
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: That can
also be useful for testing

376
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:43,120
because your application should
be able to handle all

377
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,570
failure use cases.

378
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,560
So there can be errors anywhere
in the interaction

379
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,540
between your application
and the Drive API.

380
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,830
So in your code, you should take
into account that your

381
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,640
application might not be
authorized anymore.

382
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,820
The user might have uninstalled
the app and so on.

383
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,340
And one thing you can do to land
into one of the scenarios

384
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,780
is you go back your APIs
console, change, regenerate

385
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,270
your client secret, and see
what happens, and behave

386
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,520
accordingly.

387
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,530
And that is on the
developer side.

388
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,020
There is also a part
for the user.

389
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,970
So users install the
application.

390
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,020
You've seen me installing
Loupe.

391
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,110
And when I did, the first time
I started the application, I

392
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,310
granted it access to some
specific files and documents

393
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,080
that I wanted the application
to open.

394
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,830
But at any time, I can, of
course, uninstall the app.

395
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:51,250
But I also can simply revoke
access to the application and

396
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,940
force the application to ask me
for access again the next

397
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,770
time I want to use it.

398
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,560
So the application is still
installed, but it is not

399
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,180
allowed to do requests
on my behalf.

400
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:08,260
If I want to revoke access, I
have to go to my account page.

401
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,510
And there, I have a list of
applications in size that are

402
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,849
authorized to access my feeds.

403
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,359
This is a long list.

404
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,060
This is all the applications
I've tried and so on.

405
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,839
But one of them is going
to be Loupe.

406
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,160
And next to it there will
be a button that

407
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,589
says, Revoke Access.

408
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,206
And--

409
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:30,470
ERIC GILMORE: It's not going
to be easy to find.

410
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,620
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No.

411
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,140
Well, you opened
something else.

412
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,390
Anyway--

413
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,200

414
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,950
ERIC GILMORE: I'm glad you
mentioned this, Claudio,

415
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,630
because it is, in fact, part of
the feedback we received.

416
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,160
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Oh, I see.

417
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,210
And this is also a very
important use case for

418
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,470
developers to handle.

419
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,840
So you should take into account
that at any time, the

420
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,280
user can revoke access
to your application.

421
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,760
So maybe you have
a valid token.

422
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,780
That token might be invalid
any second.

423
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:02,120
So if that happens, you as a
developer have to take the

424
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,570
user back to the Grant
Access page and ask

425
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,170
for permission again.

426
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,240
ERIC GILMORE: And handling
that case is important--

427
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,500
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Our
tutorials do it.

428
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,560
So if you use our sample
applications in the five

429
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,620
languages that we listed, you
will see how we handled that

430
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,750
specific case.

431
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,120
And the mechanism is basically
what I said.

432
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,810
Take the user back to the Grant
Access page and get a

433
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,400
new valid token.

434
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,880
ERIC GILMORE: By the way, will
it make you mad if I revoke

435
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,730
access to uefa.com?

436
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,060
I think that's not for work.

437
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,175
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, this
is not my work account.

438
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:33,520
ERIC GILMORE: Oh, all right.

439
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,245
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Anyway, you
can do it because that was for

440
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,910
the Euro Cup.

441
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:41,140
So important business
application, and it's probably

442
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,600
not there anymore.

443
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,660
ERIC GILMORE: The UEFA
wasn't really good

444
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,410
news for your country.

445
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:45,990
So--

446
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,110
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No,
we lost in the final,

447
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,080
so it's no big deal.

448
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,350
OK, did we get any other piece
of important feedback that we

449
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,590
want to talk about now?

450
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,810
ERIC GILMORE: Well, we enabled
this new feature, which allows

451
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,330
anybody reading the documents to
give us feedback yesterday.

452
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,360
And we've already received one
helpful comment, which was

453
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,820
some of our users want to see
a PDF format or maybe an F2B

454
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,630
format of our documentation.

455
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,830
And we're going to look at
that in the near future.

456
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,890
But frankly, we need
more feedback.

457
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,390
So I'm going to urge you once
more to give it to us through

458
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,670
this link or through
Stack Overflow.

459
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,530
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: One of the
feedback I got yesterday

460
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,340
before this link was there was
a face-to-face interaction

461
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,210
with a developer.

462
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:33,570
And they asked me how to get
all the updates on our

463
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,070
documentation, our
feeds, our API?

464
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,050
So how do we always know what's
new with the APIs?

465
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,870
What channels do we
have for that?

466
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,540
ERIC GILMORE: Well, one simple
static channel is to look at

467
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,740
our release notes, which
we update periodically.

468
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,750
The latest changes are listed
at the top of these sections

469
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,420
and should give you the
information on things that

470
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,280
we've changed most recently.

471
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,210
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So, for
instance, just mentioning the

472
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,080
first item in this list
was a very, very

473
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,020
heavily requested feature.

474
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:14,560
It was a way for developers to
expose a publicly available

475
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,070
link to a document.

476
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,790
So you have a document
you store

477
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,070
somewhere on Google Drive.

478
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,930
And you want this document to be
downloadable by anyone with

479
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,290
no authentication required.

480
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,220
And this is now available.

481
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,330
And now each element in the
files list, in a list of files

482
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,780
you get with the API has a field
called Web Content Link,

483
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,820
which is the link
to the document.

484
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,250
And it's publicly accessible to
anyone, of course, if the

485
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,170
document is publicly
accessible.

486
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,160
So I mean it's always up to
the user to decide who has

487
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,220
access to a document.

488
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,240
But if the document is now
public, it's also going to be

489
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,580
listed in that field.

490
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,460
ERIC GILMORE: And wherever we
can, we link you into the

491
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,550
relevant areas of the
documentation where you can

492
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,850
see details on these features
that are recently released.

493
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,750
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And,
in fact, that's a JSON

494
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,170
representation of the
file on our API.

495
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,570
What I also required today--

496
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,650
the guy who asked me yesterday
about the channels, I said

497
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,960
that we have another channel
that we use for updates and

498
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
people can subscribe to.

499
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
And that is our blog.

500
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,290
So we have a blog that
is called Google

501
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,090
Apps Developer Blog.

502
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,000
Maybe we can open it.

503
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,260
So you can just search for
Google Apps Developer Blog.

504
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,130
ERIC GILMORE: I think
that would be it.

505
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,055
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Which
is googleappsdevelo

506
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:40,980
per.blogspot.com.

507
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:48,670
And we frequently post updates,
tips and tricks, and

508
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,000
any other thing related to
the Drive SDK in the

509
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,940
other Google Apps API.

510
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,660
ERIC GILMORE: I particularly
like this latest post.

511
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,920
It's by Claudio Cherubino.

512
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,070
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, must
be a great developer.

513
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,990
ERIC GILMORE: Five things you
didn't know you could do with

514
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,120
the Google Drive API.

515
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, I
decided to share my secrets.

516
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,000
So yeah, this has been
posted yesterday.

517
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,600
So we post very, very
frequently.

518
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,320
So it's usually every
other day or so.

519
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,900
And we go into detail
for some feeds.

520
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,040
Or we explain some of things
that were not clear and so on.

521
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,940
And of course, you can add
comments to the post if you

522
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,150
think something is not clear
or have questions.

523
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,010
But if you have feedback, I
would say, as Eric said, you

524
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,990
should use the Feedback
Link in the doc.

525
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,130
ERIC GILMORE: Yes, yes.

526
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,250
Let's not forget about
that Feedback Link.

527
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,060
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Don't
forget about it.

528
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,570
Yeah, what we want to say today
is that if you have to

529
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,170
remember one thing from this
video is that there's a

530
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,370
Feedback Link in our doc that
you can now use to give us

531
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,420
more feedback because we
want more feedback.

532
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,520
ERIC GILMORE: Yes, we do.

533
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,810
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, and I
think with that, we can wrap

534
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,960
up for today.

535
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,220
Thank you very much
for watching this.

536
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,970
And see you next time.

537
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,930
ERIC GILMORE: Thank you.

538
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,530
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: See you.

539
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:14,333
