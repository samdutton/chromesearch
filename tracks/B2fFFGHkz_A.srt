00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,130
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,200
interesting developer community.

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,040
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,300
has asked this question.

6
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,475
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

7
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:08,730
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

8
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,147
answer show.

9
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:11,765
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions.

10
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:20,460

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,130
IDO GREEN: Hello and
welcome to GDLI &mdash;

12
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,360
Google Developer Live Israel.

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,690
Thank you for joining us.

14
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,870
Today we are going to speak
about mobile web apps and

15
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,040
what, as a font developer, we
should think about when we are

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,270
coming to develop a new product
or a new service or a

17
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,580
new layout to our website
or web app.

18
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,780
And of course, we want it to be
available in all the mobile

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,350
devices that are out there.

20
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,280
One common denominator of this
we see again and again in all

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,570
the devices that we have today,
and certainly in the

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,450
near future in new devices, is
one great piece of software,

23
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,870
which is the browser.

24
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,780
On most of the devices today,
we have Chrome.

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,590
And that's really good news in
the sense that you have the

26
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,150
latest and greatest
in terms of HTML5

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,900
APIs that are supported.

28
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,010
And in this short presentation,
I'll try to go

29
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,820
over the different main points
that you want to think about

30
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,770
when you are creating a new
mobile web app in terms of the

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,860
design, the building blocks,
and the tools or libraries

32
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,680
that you might want to
leverage, and not

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,050
reinvent the wheel.

34
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,910
Without further ado, let me
jump into the slides.

35
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,600
And if you'll have any
questions, I'll be more than

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,960
happy to try and answer them
at the end of the show.

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,640
So here in the first slide,
of course, we are using

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,920
geolocation.

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,330
And just do view source, and
you'll see how easy it is to

40
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,390
tap into the special ability
that we have today with mobile

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,300
devices, and then just to get
from the browser, the location

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,000
of the user, and offer them
immediately more relevant

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,580
information based on
the geoinformation

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,480
that we have on them.

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,470
If you have any questions during
the show or after it,

46
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:13,430
you're most welcome to come and
Ping me on G+ or Twitter.

47
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,190
All the slides that I'm going
through are now live under

48
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,630
ido-green.appspot.com.

49
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,460
And of course, we'll have a
summary with a transcript in

50
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,360
my blog after the show.

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
If you have some hashtags,
those are one of the most

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,600
popular ones that I'm using in
order to see what's new there

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,960
and to keep myself up to date
with new things that are

54
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,710
coming very rapidly into
the ecosystem.

55
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,100
So what we'll try to cover in
the next 25, 30 minutes will

56
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,130
be just to give a short
brief of the state of

57
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,990
the mobile web today.

58
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,180
Then we'll talk a little bit
about design philosophy, what

59
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,500
are the main things that we want
to consider and evaluate

60
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,640
when we are coming to design
a new mobile web app.

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,180
Then we'll give some best
practices and tips about how

62
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,280
to build a mobile web app.

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,220
And here is a link of a very,
very cool new game that Chrome

64
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,400
Experiments launched.

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,120
And the beauty here is that
basically we're having the

66
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,870
remote control in our
phone, in our Chrome

67
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,370
on the mobile device.

68
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,425
And we're using the
larger screen.

69
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:23,370
It could be Chrome on
the TV or Chrome on

70
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,960
your laptop or desktop.

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,820
And the game is running
on the bigger screen.

72
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,350
But the remote control for the
game is on your phone.

73
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,090
And that's, in a way, just
starting to gain the best of

74
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,140
both worlds in terms
of slickness.

75
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,010
Last but not least, we'll try
to give some tips and best

76
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,860
practices to save you time and
effort and make you more

77
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,090
productive.

78
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,310
One little warning, many things
that we are speaking

79
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,330
here &mdash; and yeah, that's a very,
very cool new effect

80
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,370
that we've been using for the
past two years, actually &mdash;

81
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,320
is just to tell you that we are
on the bleeding edge here

82
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,810
in terms of some of
the features.

83
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,070
So if we're thinking or talking
about certain things,

84
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:12,480
please go to places like
caniuse.com, or any other site

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,050
that's giving you a nice set
of things to see which

86
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,910
browsers, in terms of your
users, are using them.

87
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,940
And then you could evaluate
if you want to use

88
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,720
this specific API.

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,950
For instance, let's take
drag and drop.

90
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,810
You can see immediately which
browser are supporting it, and

91
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,050
which mobile browsers aren't
supporting it.

92
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,860
So you'll know exactly
what users

93
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,030
could enjoy it or whatnot.

94
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,670
Another really nice way to
think about it is to use

95
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,840
libraries like Modernizer and
then have feature detection

96
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,390
and not browser sniffing,
which is not good.

97
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,370
And with the feature detection,
basically you will

98
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,960
know exactly what are the set
of features or capabilities

99
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,160
that certain mobile
app is giving you.

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,320
And then based on that, you
could use responsive design

101
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,480
and progressive enhancement in
order to make sure that some

102
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,220
of the users will be able to
be productive, even if they

103
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,850
are working on older phone,
while if your user is coming

104
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,710
from the latest greatest in
terms of the hardware, you

105
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,140
could offer them more, and your
app will work smoothly,

106
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,180
better in terms of performance,
and maybe have

107
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,040
some nice set of features
that aren't

108
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,310
supported on older devices.

109
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,680
We jumped into some
mobile trains.

110
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,850
Well, the main outcome
from this slide is

111
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,280
that mobile is big.

112
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,840
And mobile usage is actually
going to overtake desktop.

113
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,200
Basically we see the pace
growing rapidly.

114
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,000
And it might be even before
we reach 2014.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,790
Another important thing here
is we have already nice

116
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,430
research from third party
companies &mdash; so take it with a

117
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,820
grain of salt &mdash;

118
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,070
about seeing that actually
the mobile web is here.

119
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,730
It's here to stay.

120
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,000
And lots of users
are using it.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,200
Here's a specific case
that Chitika did.

122
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,990
We see it happening in the ISO
world, happening right now

123
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,240
pretty rapidly.

124
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,350

125
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,950
When we're speaking about mobile
browser, the good news

126
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,040
is that most of them got very
nice elegant browsers that are

127
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,170
supporting quite a lot
of HTML5 features.

128
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,790
In terms of the coverage, it's
around 95% of web kit.

129
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,380
And that's including
iOS, Android,

130
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,370
BlackBerry, and some others.

131
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,150
The main features that we are
still missing are WebGL, Web

132
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,240
Audio API, that probably is
coming really soon in some of

133
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,740
the browsers, and Shared
Web Workers.

134
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,230
In progress, we have today
nice cool things like the

135
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,400
Camera API and IndexedDB which
is a full blown NoSQL database

136
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,840
that we have today in
Chrome for Android.

137
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,490
For other ecosystems,
like iOS, you'll

138
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,360
want to use Web SQL.

139
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,990
But since this spec is
deprecated from 2010, you

140
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,570
might want to use something like
launcher, and then have

141
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,907
the ability to switch on the fly
between the database that

142
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:20,600
you're working.

143
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,770
So if you'll use launcher, and
we'll have the link to this

144
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,880
library at the end of the
slides, you could work with

145
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,910
both Web SQL IndexedDB.

146
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,470
And if other browser are
supporting, let's say, local

147
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,800
storage, you'd be able
to work with that.

148
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,160
So that's a nice way to approach
things, and then

149
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,800
enjoy both worlds in supporting
several ecosystems,

150
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,420
just to make sure that you'll
be able to work with offline

151
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:53,570
first and offer your users the
best environment and best

152
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,490
experience with your
search and app.

153
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,560
This is just a quick graph to
show how quickly we're seeing

154
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,050
Android going up, and how WebKit
is supported on all the

155
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,030
major platforms, as I mentioned
before, Android,

156
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,410
iPhone, BlackBerry, iPod
Touch, et cetera.

157
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,260

158
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,920
When we come into the old debate
between web and native,

159
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,170
it's always refreshing to
think about using and

160
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,240
leveraging the best
tools for the job.

161
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,190
So in terms of being close to
the metal and using all of the

162
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,820
great features that you have
today, let's take, for

163
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,230
example, on Android platform,
you probably want to create

164
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,720
native apps so it will work as
close as possible to the

165
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,000
metal, and will give you
all the full range

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,030
of different APIs.

167
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,730
The web, on the other end,
is a unified platform.

168
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,910
As we mentioned before, you
have it on different

169
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,860
ecosystems.

170
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,610
In all of them, you'll
have the browser.

171
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,150
And even on all the forms, you
do have the browsers that will

172
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,730
be able to read your HTML and
show the user what you want

173
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,750
them to consume.

174
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,930
Native, of course, is
a moving target.

175
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,470
And we're seeing it being
improved very rapidly,

176
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,540
although we're seeing
the web pushing the

177
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,070
boundaries again and again.

178
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,445
And the APIs guys are getting
closer and closer.

179
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:22,330

180
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,330
This standardization on the web
is moving a bit slowly.

181
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,425
But the good news, or the half
full part of the cup is that

182
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:32,320
it's catching up.

183
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,560
And the pace is getting
better and better.

184
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,340
Here there's a link to a Scott
Jason presentation about what

185
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,180
he thinks mobile web will look
like in the next few years.

186
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,060
And I highly encourage
you to check it out.

187
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,180
It's really worth
your 45 minutes.

188
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,190
Here are some really nice
examples, just to see what

189
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,980
others are doing there.

190
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,270
"Financial Times," it's, of
course, a media company.

191
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,880
And their app is really a nice
way to show you how you could

192
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,410
tap into the offline
world with a full

193
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,530
blown mobile web app.

194
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:23,060
Workflowy, it's to do list on
steroids, or actually a way

195
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,220
for you to organize your things
and thoughts on lists,

196
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,510
also working very nicely.

197
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,660
And of course, mobile Twitter,
which is another good example.

198
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,510
And we have plenty of
other examples.

199
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,580
I'll have links to how you could
gain more ideas in the

200
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,510
next slide.

201
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,940
Here's a link that shows us
another research company that

202
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,780
basically users want to work
with the mobile web.

203
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,140
They are using the browsers
more and more.

204
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,090
And in some cases, it makes
perfect sense for them to open

205
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,810
the browser, launch your
dedicated web app to a

206
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,990
specific task or goal, achieve
what they wanted, and move on.

207
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,330
Some bold, good examples,
we mentioned Twitter.

208
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,610
Gmail, of course, it's a full
blown mobile web app that are

209
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,990
working really nicely and giving
you really nice special

210
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,280
features in terms of the
capabilities, the offline

211
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,490
features, and all the
other great benefits

212
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,220
that we have in Gmail.

213
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,840
Another nice way to think about
this, like with this app

214
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,740
for Footspotting, where you have
a limited real estate,

215
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,880
try to do your best to tap into
what the user is wanting

216
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,060
to achieve with your
dedicated app.

217
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,920
So in that example, we certainly
don't need any

218
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,120
footer, header, sidebar,
or things that

219
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,230
will clutter the app.

220
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,830
Very clean approach.

221
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,910
And you can see more and more
way of thinking in those

222
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,570
words, in apps like
[INAUDIBLE]

223
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,400
and other really
nice examples.

224
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,230
So let's try and speak
briefly about design.

225
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,550
First, in the old days, we have
this notion of going to

226
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,780
the designer.

227
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,320
He's or she's working
with the Photoshop,

228
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,490
giving us the assets.

229
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,290
Then we need someone to
cut the HTML and CSS.

230
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:13,110
And very cluttered, not truly
elegant or agile methodology.

231
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,190
Today, I tried to break it here
into pieces that actually

232
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,390
allow us to work much faster,
iterate faster, and see how

233
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,980
we're prototyping and getting
ideas out there as soon as we

234
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,720
can, just to validate them
before we are going to the

235
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,350
last phase of production.

236
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,390
So today, you'll see more and
more people doing design

237
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,630
through wire frames, or even
trying to mock up how it will

238
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,370
look like pretty quickly.

239
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,550
And there's plenty of online
tools that make you

240
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,680
productive with it.

241
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,970
The basic asset is to put the
ideas on paper, on board, on a

242
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,790
napkin, or on any platform that
you want, and then quite

243
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,110
quickly to sketch it with HTML
and a bit of CSS, just to see

244
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,280
how it will look like,
how it will feel.

245
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,360
Then we want to achieve a bit
of responsiveness and logic.

246
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,310
And probably those cases will
go to the upper right block

247
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,970
here, and add some JavaScript
to add our own

248
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,420
magic to the prototype.

249
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,130
And from there, basically we're
going to the polish

250
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,965
phase, which I call that the
important phase that separate

251
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,800
the true professional one's from
that amateur ones, where

252
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,780
we want you to work as slick as
we can as fast as we can.

253
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,300
And this is actually a place
where we are going back to the

254
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,380
scheduled prototype, but
want to iterate over it

255
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,520
as fast as we can.

256
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,380
Of course we want a test-driven
development in a

257
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,960
way, or to have a final phase of
continuous integration, and

258
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,210
to do some really testing on
real devices, just to make

259
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,380
sure that we have a nice
coverage with the 28-year

260
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,330
rules, or any other rules that
you want to do in order to

261
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,840
make sure that the vast majority
of your users will be

262
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,450
able to be productive
and enjoy your app.

263
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,670
And last but not least, of
course, we want to push it to

264
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,800
production, have our alpha beta
release candidate, and,

265
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,730
of course, the first
version out there.

266
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,180
But as we all know, today, the
end of the trip is just one

267
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,700
stepping stone in it.

268
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,780
We'll want to iterate again
and again and have more

269
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,220
features over time.

270
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,210
When we're coming to speak about
it, basically the one

271
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,320
fundamental shifting in thinking
is that we're not

272
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,080
speaking about pages anymore.

273
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,440
We're more working on this
one page application.

274
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,660
And we want to make sure that
we do the best with the

275
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,030
limited real estate and give a
set of guidance or a set of

276
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,080
tools for users to achieve
their goals with maximum

277
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,650
efficiency.

278
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,380
We'll want to use components.

279
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,340
So we don't want to reinvent
the wheel.

280
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,240
And the web as a platform,
actually, is going to give us

281
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,490
just that in the near future.

282
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,830
So now, if you want to check the
water, just try AngularJS

283
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,780
with directives, which basically
giving you a really

284
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,500
nice way to think about reusing
your code, don't

285
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,150
repeat yourself, and just
leveraging things that you

286
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,290
already did in the past.

287
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,220
As we mentioned, in mobile and,
of course, in mobile web,

288
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,130
less is more in most
of the cases.

289
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,710
Because we don't have a lot of
real estate and the user got

290
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,060
some fat fingers in most of
the cases, we'll want few

291
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,170
buttons, few words, just to make
sure that we are aiming

292
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,890
or making the life of our users
as easy as possible, as

293
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,550
efficient as possible.

294
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,900
Here is just a nice example of
[? Path ?] and what they did

295
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,000
with their menu button.

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,240
And if you'll search on GitHub,
you'll find lots of

297
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,120
repositories that give you just
that, nice interactions

298
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,750
of collapsing the different
options from the bottom left

299
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,490
corner back and forth, a very
nice way to think about.

300
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,590
And another two tips here to
remember, that on mobile

301
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,510
devices we do have the landscape
that is changing.

302
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,700
So we want to do the best in
order to use media queries and

303
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,520
just be able to communicate
it to the user.

304
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,260
And of course, using just
Photoshop is not as efficient

305
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,530
as we wanted to see.

306
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,010
And in lots of cases, we
probably could do less with

307
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,930
Photoshop and mobile.

308
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,060
We're just prototyping
and using HTML,

309
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,310
JavaScript, and CSS.

310
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,370

311
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,200
Here are some really nice bold
examples, that you really

312
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,900
don't want to reinvent
the wheel.

313
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,290
You want to be inspire.

314
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,150
And pttrns.com and
mobile-patterns are just those

315
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,500
two sites that give you the
ability to go and see what

316
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,640
others did when they needed a
map application or a long

317
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,820
list, or any other things
that they wanted to do.

318
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,100
And it just will save you time
and efforts, and make sure

319
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,690
that you'll be able to do
nice things with them.

320
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,890
Let's just, for the sake of
argument, open it so we'll be

321
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,320
able to see.

322
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,790
So here are some
recently added.

323
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,450
But let's say that we want to
see what interesting things

324
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,040
people have done with lists.

325
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,990
You have a very nice collection
of things here just

326
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,810
to inspire you and to
take it from there.

327
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,430

328
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,190
And of course, the nice
example of a path.

329
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,470
So we wanted to do this quick
sketch-up to see how things

330
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,220
are working.

331
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,710
And here are a few nice
online tools.

332
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,810
I will just add that on top of
these tools, you could go

333
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,720
today to jQuery mobile site,
and you'll have basically

334
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
[INAUDIBLE] there that lets you
mock up real quickly and

335
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,250
get even the structure of the
HTML from your mock, really

336
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,750
nice and easy to use.

337
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,050
Balsamiq is, of course, a very
popular, nice web app that

338
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,090
gives you the ability to do
those things efficiently, and

339
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,780
others, modern web apps
that are there.

340
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,680
And you could retrieve them
from the Chrome Web Store.

341
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,490
One thing to remember after we
did our sketching is that you

342
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:57,820
want to make sure that what you
designed is doing the best

343
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,670
for the phone or
for the tablet.

344
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,890
They are not the same.

345
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,670
And one thing that we could
probably save ourself is the

346
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,310
notion of let's aim and do
whatever we can with all the

347
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:16,170
devices that have 4" by 3"
screens or 16" by 9", just to

348
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,010
make sure that we are not going
too crazy with the media

349
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:24,080
queries to adjust our app to
each and every device.

350
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,310
But a nice example that you see
here with Flipboard, check

351
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,860
their app on a tablet
and on a phone.

352
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,240
It's completely different.

353
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,550
Even the ability to do the flip
itself, they didn't use

354
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,740
the muscle memory that users
have in the tablet, which is

355
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,980
horizontal reason flip.

356
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,540
And they choose on the phone
to do it vertically because

357
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,710
it's just a better experience.

358
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,190
And that's a great example to do
what is best for our users,

359
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,730
and, of course, validate
it with testing.

360
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,050
When we're speaking about
adaptive apps, apps that are

361
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,240
less bind into a specific
screen, we're talking

362
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,560
basically about doing a re-paint
and refresh of our

363
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,760
DOM, of our structure based on
the real estate that we're

364
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
getting in the app itself.

365
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,380
And we know that one of the
main pitfalls is that it's

366
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,550
really hard to use the same DOM
tree for all form factors.

367
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,120
So we're seeing today a nice
interesting debate between,

368
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,750
OK, let's have one DOM and
just use different media

369
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,370
queries with different CSS.

370
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,650
Or let's do some sniffing in
advance to see which device is

371
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,145
coming, and then just make sure
that we are sending back

372
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:44,470
the dedicated HTML CSS and
JavaScript that will do the

373
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,150
best for this specific medium.

374
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,710
When we're speaking about all
those adaptive apps, we want

375
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,530
to use some sort of a temperate
library, in order to

376
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,120
make sure that our DOM
refreshing and repainting will

377
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,790
be as efficient as possible.

378
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,710
And we'll see in the next slides
how we could do that.

379
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,490
And of course, when we're using
responsive design, we

380
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,290
want to use things like read
box, Flexbox, and not, of

381
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,390
course, absolute position or
relative position, because it

382
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,920
won't work nicely on the
different devices as we have

383
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,820
today, not to mention
future devices.

384
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,540
When we're using the CSS3 new
grid layouts or Flexbox

385
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,870
layout, we could do ourself a
favor and just focus on those

386
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,680
form factors, which will make
our life a bit easier, and are

387
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,650
still very good for the vast
majority of the users.

388
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,230
Here is the link
for [INAUDIBLE]

389
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,630
site, which contains a huge
amount of really nice

390
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,760
information.

391
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,080
And of course, media queries,
which is letting you see

392
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,350
different examples in the wild
and getting some ideas how

393
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,490
your web app or website should
look on a desktop, tablet, and

394
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,700
a mobile device.

395
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,020
Let's jump real quick
to building.

396
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,280
Of course, when we're shifted
more and more logic to the

397
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,490
client side, we want some clear
separation between our

398
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,500
data and our views.

399
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,900
And that's why we see a
flourishing in all the MV-star

400
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,390
frameworks today.

401
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:21,150
And if in the past we used to
have this logic in the server,

402
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,400
and just sending to the client
HTML pages that represent this

403
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,080
logic, we're seeing more and
more movement of a thicker

404
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,550
client that contain more
and more knowledge.

405
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,210
And that's come with the notion
of offline first, when

406
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,780
basically we want the user to be
productive, even when there

407
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,880
is no connection or a
flaky connection.

408
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,850
Just a clear scanner to see what
we're talking about when

409
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,690
we're speaking about model view
controller framework, and

410
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,390
specifically in the case of
mobile web app, we do want our

411
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,350
views to have the dedicated
view for each form factor.

412
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,180
So we'll have one view for
desktop, maybe another one for

413
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,760
TV here on the right
side, and of course

414
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,490
for tablets and phone.

415
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,630
We could share the same
controller to hold our data

416
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,280
and to update our view.

417
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,630
And here is a link to what
[INAUDIBLE] did, which is a

418
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,770
great, great thing in terms of
comparing the different MVC

419
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,100
frameworks that are out there.

420
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,900
Another nice code snippet that
you could take here is to do

421
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,130
something like that in order
to understand which form

422
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,160
factor the user is using, and
then make sure that your code

423
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,650
and other goodness
is bring to them.

424
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,360

425
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,790
And I see here people
are saying

426
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,540
dedicate view for Glass.

427
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,220
Absolutely.

428
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,780
I can't agree more, actually.

429
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,760
In terms of the products
of choice, basically

430
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,680
we'll see it again.

431
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,980
We had it in the service side a
few years back, when you see

432
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,520
a huge flourishing in all
the MVC frameworks

433
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,960
in Java, for instance.

434
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,570
And now we have the same with
JavaScript and the client side

435
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,800
MVC frameworks.

436
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,770
Here we don't jump into
it, because we don't

437
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,540
have too much time.

438
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,830
I'll just mention those three
really bold examples.

439
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:10,610
And with five seconds promotion
to Angular, I really

440
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,310
encourage you to check it, not
because it's an open source

441
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,100
project that started in Google,
of course not, just

442
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,920
because it's a true passion of
mine to see how people are

443
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,940
thinking about dynamic HTML, not
static HTML, and how you

444
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,290
have dependency [? injection ?]

445
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,360
and test-driven development
in a JavaScript framework.

446
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,830
Really, really cool stuff.

447
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,970
This is one of the compression
tables that you'll see if

448
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,350
you'll go to the link and the
work, the hard work that

449
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,080
[INAUDIBLE]

450
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,380
did.

451
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,300
I highly encourage you to see.

452
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,330
And basically even here, don't
take my word to AngularJS or

453
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,280
to the wisdom of the crowd,
quote unquote, that's going

454
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,340
with Backbone.

455
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,930
Just do small research for
yourself and choose the best

456
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,730
tool for the job.

457
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,190
The TodoMVC, of course, what we
mention, the link is here.

458
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,110
When we want to run our complex
app, and we want to do

459
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,580
some DOM manipulation, we know
that we need to do it as

460
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,060
efficient as possible.

461
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,540
And here the big secret, which
is basically not a secret at

462
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,260
all, is to use a JavaScript
templating mechanism.

463
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,010
Nicely, we have it now baked
into Chrome and hopefully

464
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,790
other modem browser
real quick.

465
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,750
So this is the link
with [INAUDIBLE].

466
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,420
So you'll be able to tap
into it and to read.

467
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,700
It's a very good tutorial
that Eric Bidelman

468
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,900
did on HTML5 Rock.

469
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,890
But here we'll just show you how
you could do it even today

470
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,190
that will basically support
all the browsers.

471
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,880
We're using an embedded and a
certain new type to make sure

472
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,400
that our templating engine
will work with it.

473
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,950
And we'll bundle it
into the HTML.

474
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,290
And then we could use several
templating engines.

475
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:55,160
So here I use mustache.js, which
is a very popular choice

476
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,610
of the logic-less templating
engine.

477
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,550
And you could see the example,
even if you never saw it in

478
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,370
advance, that what we have here
is basically three parts.

479
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,740
One is the templating.

480
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,010
And if you'll move your head to
the right, you'll see why

481
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,930
they call it mustache, because
of these little guys.

482
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,140
And here we'll just declare
what we're going to

483
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,760
have in each spot.

484
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,610
Then we're using a payload
of our JSON.

485
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,150
And the result, what the
templating engine will put in

486
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,580
our page will be this mark-up
that the browser

487
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,830
will know how to render.

488
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,160

489
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,770
Another cool thing that we
should leverage today when we

490
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:36,320
are approaching the world of
mobile web app is some new

491
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,430
CSS3 products.

492
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,590
And basically I'm talking
about [INAUDIBLE]

493
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,620
which giving us some goodies,
not really a synthetic sugar

494
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,760
but more of real tools to work
with, like variables, like

495
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,870
nesting, and mixing and
inheritance in CSS.

496
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:02,580
So your ability to work more
efficiently with CSS will gain

497
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,330
you more hour of sleep
and happy users.

498
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,450
And one nice thing to remember
is that when you're working

499
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,700
with it, basically it's easy
today even to debug it because

500
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,790
you have the ability to go
quickly in Chrome Dev tools

501
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:24,990
and tap into the source itself
of the CSS or the source code,

502
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,060
with Map Source, of course.

503
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,330
Some best practices
for the layout &mdash;

504
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,050
of course avoid the horrible
tables that have been with us

505
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,580
in the late '90s.

506
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,870
No absolute position, not
even relative position.

507
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,510
We do want to use something
like the Flexbox.

508
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,890
Why?

509
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,090
Because we basically are able
to communicate the browser

510
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,400
exactly what we want
it to achieve.

511
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,680
Things like, OK separate now
those boxes and make the

512
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,200
middle boxes twice the size from
the other boxes, or make

513
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,490
all of them in a row or
a column, et cetera.

514
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,400
It's all trivial with Flexbox,
and just challenging you to do

515
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,750
it with the regular CSS.

516
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,335
It will be much, much harder,
and more code for you to read

517
00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:14,020
later when you're coming to
maintain the web app.

518
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,490
This little example is just to
show you how you can control

519
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,630
here on the orientation.

520
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,540
So here it's horizontal.

521
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,680
If the user is flipping the
phone, you could do it

522
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,050
vertical as well.

523
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,580
And very easy to control
the different

524
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,225
components of your Flexbox.

525
00:27:31,225 --> 00:27:33,770

526
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,030
The one caveat here is
that we're talking

527
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,630
about the new Flexbox.

528
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,360
And there are relatively really
few changes that you

529
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,880
need to pay attention to.

530
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,770
This is just to show you how you
could easily control them.

531
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,400
And really nice talks on
developer.google.com/live

532
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,010
showing you more how
to work with it.

533
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,580

534
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,765
Some tips to remember is that
if you want to have a fixed

535
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,250
position for your head or
footers, it used to be a big

536
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,700
no-no in all the browsers.

537
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,720
Now both on Mobile Safari and,
of course, Chrome for Android,

538
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,520
you just need to do
position fix.

539
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,770
If you have an element that you
want to scroll elements

540
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,510
inside it, just do
overall scroll.

541
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:20,510
And last but not least, if you
want this nice responsive

542
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:25,260
acceleration, deceleration
scrolling in WebKit, and as we

543
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,810
mentioned at the beginning, 90%
plus of the browser are

544
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,890
supporting it, just do WebKit
overflow scrolling touch, and

545
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:37,870
you'll be able to gain
this nice ability.

546
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,040
One important thing to note
about touch is that it's very

547
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,520
different for our mouse.

548
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,280
We need to make sure that
we are listening

549
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,600
to the right events.

550
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,070
And one common pitfall is to
bind events to the click.

551
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,870
On mobile and touch screens,
of course the browser will

552
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,130
wait 300 milliseconds, because
it needs to distinguish one

553
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,490
click to two clicks.

554
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,440
And this is why I put the link
here to Fast Click Library

555
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,740
that the "Financial Times"
did, actually [INAUDIBLE]

556
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,700
that was bought by the
"Financial Times," and which

557
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,170
basically listened to the touch
start in making sure

558
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,700
that it's much smoother and
much more responsive.

559
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,450
And the other good link here is
just to best practices of

560
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,590
developing for multi-touch
blog posts

561
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,650
that Boris Smus wrote.

562
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,120
When we're coming to the world
of offline, and specifically

563
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,220
mobile web apps, we want to make
sure that our app will

564
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,340
work even when there's
no connection.

565
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,640
Why?

566
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,290
Because in the cases where we
have a flaky connection, or on

567
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,780
an airplane or submarine, the
user could be productive.

568
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,030
And a great example is
[INAUDIBLE], of course.

569
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,520
And today, lucky for us, we have
all the building blocks.

570
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,970
So I know that they are not
perfect and they could

571
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,250
improve over time.

572
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,850
And I see the guys that are
mentioning and trying to point

573
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,080
their fingers to some
known candidates.

574
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,050
But here they will get better.

575
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,010
And actually we are able to work
with them today, so why

576
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,990
not tap in to them?

577
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,980
To storing [? updates ?]

578
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,590
of course, we have all
the good things here.

579
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:17,420
And to know when to do the sync,
basically the main API

580
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,440
that we want to use
is Navigator

581
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,200
online or Window online.

582
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,960
As I mentioned before, Lawnchair
is one good library

583
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,080
to use when we want to make
sure that we all doing the

584
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,690
best with the certain app or
certain browser that our app

585
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,070
have to use, which will
basically give us the ability

586
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,760
to enjoy all those nice APIs,
depending on what the

587
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,640
different browser on the user
device is supporting.

588
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,930
And here is a short tutorial
that I wrote a while back to

589
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:48,810
help people converge from WebSQL
to IndexedDB, just

590
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,990
because WebSQL is a
depricated API.

591
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,030
So you don't want to start
a new project with it.

592
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,990
One thing that held mobile
web apps was the

593
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,095
ability to debug them.

594
00:31:01,095 --> 00:31:03,856
It wasn't too easy.

595
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:07,210
Of course, for Chrome for
Android, your life is good.

596
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,620
And you could do lots of things
immediately and have

597
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,260
basically Chrome Dev tools
and work with them very

598
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,330
efficiently on your
mobile as well.

599
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,450
But for other platforms, we
have JS Console that Remy

600
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,670
Sharp wrote, and all the other
good links here that you are

601
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,860
most welcome to check, and
other nice things.

602
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,510
I don't know how many people
know, but basically in Chrome

603
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,090
browser we have a
server as well.

604
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,837
So you could run it with this
remote debugging port, which

605
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:39,440
is basically part of WebKit,
and have the ability to tap

606
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,570
and run Dev Tool, or connect
your Dev Tool to client

607
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,850
browsers, and again, gain all
the capabilities and the

608
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,430
benefits that we have
in Chrome Dev Tools.

609
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,920
Testing, MVC or the clear
separation between our data

610
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,230
and our views allow us,
basically, to test our models.

611
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,510
And QUnit is one
great example.

612
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,590
When we're coming to test our
views, it's much more

613
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,520
challenging.

614
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,430
And here are some good
links to help you

615
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,980
achieve that as well.

616
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,800
Speed &mdash;

617
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,230
[INAUDIBLE]

618
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:20,100
all the recent studies shows
form all the big names, like

619
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,510
Amazon, Facebook,
Google, Yahoo,

620
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,440
every millisecond count.

621
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,470
And you do want your users
happy and smiling.

622
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,710
And that's why you need
to focus on mobile web

623
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,680
performance, and web performance
as a whole.

624
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,250
And luckily for all
of us, [INAUDIBLE]

625
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:41,940
on developer.google.com/live is
doing great shows about web

626
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,140
performance and pushing
the web faster.

627
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,770
And I highly encourage
you to see his shows.

628
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,460
Really, really quality,
great stuff there.

629
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,620
When we're coming to
optimization, there are a few

630
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,450
tools that are helping
us today.

631
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,910
Blaze.io, that is part of Akamai
let us know exactly

632
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,310
what's going with our
apps from different

633
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,720
places in the world.

634
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,770
And this other link here is
Mobile Perf for bookmarketlet

635
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:12,020
that Steve Souders did to enable
you to tap into a lot

636
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,990
of information from your mobile
web app, and then

637
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,470
analyze it, of course,
on the desktop.

638
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,520
And SPDY.

639
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:23,360
SPDY is basically a new
experimental protocol designed

640
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,050
by Google to reduce the
latency of web pages.

641
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,690
And it's in Chrome.

642
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,720
So you could use it today.

643
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,400
It will work much faster
for your users.

644
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,247
And you have mode
SPDY in a patch.

645
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:39,800
So if you have control of your
servers, I highly encourage

646
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,720
you to check it out.

647
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,050
The link here will show you how
easy it is to install it

648
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,238
and customize it.

649
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:48,510
Last but not least, some
tips and tricks.

650
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:54,080
We have today few tech stocks
that choose the route of

651
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,290
convention over configuration.

652
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,740
And some really brilliant people
with lots of experience

653
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,290
on their hands choose the best
tools out there to make your

654
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,780
life more productive.

655
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,980
And Yeoman and Thorax are just
two bold examples that I

656
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,699
highly encourage you to check
out when you are coming to

657
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,610
start a new project.

658
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,900
If you are developing on
iOS, there's a new &mdash;

659
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,570
it's not new, actually &mdash; but a
nice way to be able to see

660
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,530
more loggin, and that's by
setting Safari developer and

661
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,179
then just opening the console.

662
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,590
To simulate touch events,
you have it today

663
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,650
in Chrome Dev Tools.

664
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,489
And let me showing you
how you could do it.

665
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,423

666
00:34:36,423 --> 00:34:40,498
If you'll come here to the
bottom right corner and click

667
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:45,760
on the setting, you'll
be able to open the

668
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,719
setting of the Dev Tools.

669
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,179
Probably for you it will
open in general.

670
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,550
But if you'll go to Override
here, you'll need to click

671
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,100
here on Emulate Events.

672
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,070
Let me make it bigger.

673
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,980
And once you do that, you'll be
able to listen to all the

674
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,930
different touch events and make
sure that your mobile web

675
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,260
apps is answering them.

676
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,040
It's not a replacement to
testing it on simulator or on

677
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,580
a physical device.

678
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,080
But it's just making the
developer life more productive

679
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,270
when they could use it while
they're developing it, and

680
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,420
make sure that at least you're
answering all the right events

681
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,470
in the right DOM and using the
audit and performance tab in

682
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,400
the Chrome Dev Tools to make
sure that you are optimizing

683
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,570
even before you are reaching
the physical device.

684
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,250
Privatization, of course, it's
very, very important.

685
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,050
And like any app, we want to
focus on the MVP or the task

686
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:45,280
that you want to user to
achieve with maximum

687
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,380
efficiency.

688
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,650
Take advantage, of course, of
mobile specific functionality,

689
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,230
like the geolocation, like the
camera, things that are very

690
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,240
important for users.

691
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,090
And of course, not
to mention touch.

692
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,310
When you're building to the
mobile platform, always think

693
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:05,640
about speed, because it's
really, really different from

694
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,920
what users are expecting or
getting when they're using

695
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,210
their desktops or laptops.

696
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,610
And of course, optimization
don't start it

697
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,970
before you need to.

698
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:20,580
But do pay attention and
do it as the last step.

699
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,890
So to keep yourself updated with
Chrome as a platform, we

700
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,600
have Chrome today on mobile
devices, tablets, desktops,

701
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,480
laptops, and TVs, that's
a great site to

702
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,360
check Chrome status.

703
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,640
All the latest and greatest in
terms of HTML5 APIs are there.

704
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,400
And you could see exactly which
Chromium browser will

705
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,040
support them, or supporting
them already.

706
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,150
Another great site to keep
yourself updated, it's

707
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,400
updates.html5.rock.

708
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,680

709
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,910
As you can see, we're keeping
it fresh all the time.

710
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:59,280
And here are just a list of
resources that you might want

711
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,200
to check and leverage
after our show.

712
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,740

713
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,830
So that's basically
what I had.

714
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,580
If we have any questions, this
is a great time to ask them.

715
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,020
Just feel free over the chat
or through the handout.

716
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,380

717
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,960
So I see one question here
from [INAUDIBLE]

718
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,530
is for newbies, "what would you
recommend to start with

719
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,440
for mobile web development?"
So let's go &mdash;

720
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,300
I see [INAUDIBLE]

721
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,450
already answered him
about slide 34.

722
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,700
Let's see.

723
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,590

724
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,210
So I will actually answer
it in two ways.

725
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,190
One is, of course, you want to
check Yeoman or Thorax in

726
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,340
terms of the full stacks
that you want to start

727
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,590
from the ground up.

728
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,110
Those stacks will give you the
best practices in terms of the

729
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,260
libraries, the tools, and the
ability to compile and

730
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,310
optimize your app itself.

731
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,310
By as a newbie, I will go and
just check what jQuery Mobile

732
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,010
or [INAUDIBLE]

733
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,870
are doing.

734
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:15,400
And those are really good
frameworks slash libraries to

735
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,960
start working with them.

736
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,210
And of course, you have Twitter
Bootstrap Responsive

737
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,540
as another great
starting point.

738
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,720
They're basically giving you
a nice CSS template, a

739
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,590
responsive template to start
your mobile web app.

740
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:33,760
An in Twitter Bootstrap, for
instance, you have also a nice

741
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,050
range of jQuery plug-ins that
allow you to have all the

742
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,190
common functionality that
you might need.

743
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,670
jQuery Mobile is a really nice
one, because they already did

744
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:48,450
lots leg works for you by
checking and making sure that

745
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,620
the platform itself will
work on a really

746
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,060
wide range of devices.

747
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,830
And [INAUDIBLE], of course,
are doing lots of fun nice

748
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,970
things in terms of the touch
library that they have.

749
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,080
It's more complicated,
I agree.

750
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,705
But if you are building a
complicated app that your

751
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:10,090
users will spend a lot of time
in it, it's a really nice

752
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,910
library that will serve you in
the end of the day lots of

753
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:18,360
wheels that you'll probably
need to reinvent yourself.

754
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,200
[? Dodger ?]

755
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,960
Mobile is another
good candidate.

756
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,820
And I'm sure there are
plenty of others that

757
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,940
I'm not aware of.

758
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,790
Those are the ones that
I played in the past.

759
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,080
But you are most welcome to
check and let me know.

760
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,680
And I'll be able to update
actually those slides and the

761
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,650
blog post that we'll have as
a summary for this talk.

762
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,620

763
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,540
Any other questions
or comments?

764
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,377

765
00:39:48,377 --> 00:39:52,640
OK, guys, so thank
you very much.

766
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,660
Oh, how did I create
this presentation?

767
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,930
Just do view source.

768
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,700
It's all HTML, HTML5.

769
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,090
You are most welcome
to take it.

770
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,720
The structure of the
presentation itself is sitting

771
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,750
on code.google.com.

772
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,410
Just have fun.

773
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,050
OK, guys, thank you very much.

774
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,130
And be strong.

775
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,380
Until next time, bye-bye.

776
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:19,263
