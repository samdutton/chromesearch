1
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:14,179
>>Paul Irish: Cool. All right, guys. My name
is Paul Irish and I am a developer advocate

2
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,930
on the Chrome team.
I want to talk a little bit about tooling.

3
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,630
So this is about building Web apps, finding
the right software to make your process of

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,980
building Web apps fun, awesome, enjoyable,
less stressful, more productive, things like

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,579
that.
Now, I'm going to talk a little bit about

6
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:35,670
kind of how we're building Web apps today
and how I think we can build them in the future,

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,510
but for a second I want to take a few steps
back and walk back a few years, back to 2006

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:47,050
because this is the year that I wrote like
my first website where I was like doing all

9
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,069
the right things when it came to Web standards.
And I felt so good about the way that I was

10
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:57,620
doing it, so I was actually here and I did
something probably like this, and I was doing

11
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,620
a little bit of this and then this and then
that and then that and that, da, da...

12
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,979
This is typical, right?
[Laughter]

13
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:13,280
>>Paul Irish: Oh, there we go. Nice! Cool.
[ Applause ]

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,340
>>Paul Irish: All right. I'm really glad we
don't have to type that out anymore. That's

15
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,680
really nice.
But this is like &mdash; so what I actually did

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,289
is when I made this site, and it turned out
to be really nice, I did the whole thing in

17
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:35,289
Notepad. And I think we consider it a little
funny now that I would write like pretty significant

18
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:46,149
site in Notepad, but at the time I was like,
"I'm a craftsman over my markup and I will

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:55,140
be one with it, and the closest I can be in
it is in Notepad exe." So I just used that.

20
00:01:55,509 --> 00:02:02,500
And it just seems kind of silly. I thought
I was so close to it, but really it's not

21
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,119
really craftsmanship. That was handcraft.
That was like the Web's development equivalent

22
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,730
to whittling a stick.
And handcraft is more about choosing tools

23
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,769
well, finding the right tools to get the job
done and assist you.

24
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:26,470
And I noticed this too, I started at Google
about two years ago, and looking around when

25
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,290
you're surrounded by really smart people,
and you notice what the really productive

26
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,760
developers do. And they know their &mdash; they
have tools that they use, they know them really

27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,830
well, and they embrace them. And so I kind
of like noticed that there was a theme going

28
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,849
on here.
And so I want to talk a little bit about tools.

29
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,180
And this is not about, you know, Google development
tools. This is about &mdash; you know, you don't

30
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,069
have to be building the next Gmail for this
kind stuff to apply to you. It's for everyone.

31
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:02,459
A lot of people have been noticing this recently.
And I just want you to, like, think about

32
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,769
remember there was a point at which you didn't
actually use version control. You might have

33
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,000
been on a team and you're like, Hey, I'm going
to be editing, indexing HTML. Can you hold

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
on just a second? Okay, you can do it now.
Like source safe. It was, like, annoying,

35
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:24,540
but version control made it a lot better.
And we can focus on development, not tiresome

36
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,150
debugging when you don't want to be doing
it.

37
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,640
And then how much time have you lost when
you actually had a colon where you were supposed

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,180
to have a semi colon or an extra comma at
the end of your little object in JavaScript,

39
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,260
and you were like ah!
There's lots of funny things. I'm not going

40
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,360
to click to it. It's a little not safe to
work, commit logs from last night, pulling

41
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,360
in logs from GitHub where people happen to
use expletives because they're a bit frustrated.

42
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,620
People that are making silly mistakes that
they probably don't need to.

43
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,969
So we're seeing a little bit of shift towards
looking at tools assisting us. And Rebecca

44
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:10,969
Murphy did a great post about this sort of
shift recently, and she said we're seeing

45
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:16,190
us focus from valuing trivia to valuing tools.
And a similar thing was said a little bit

46
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,470
ago by Michael Lop, known by Rams online.
He's an engineering manager at Apple. He said,

47
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,440
There's a short list of tools that you must
be rabid about, rabid, foaming at the mouth

48
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,440
crazy. And he went on to talk about how he
used his editor, his terminal and what made

49
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,400
him productive.
And I think this is important to really identify

50
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,479
what you feel great about. And so I've done
a little bit of research and it talks about

51
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,460
this, and there's a lot of tools.
When I say tools, it like covers a lot of

52
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,770
things. So this is a quick way of trying to
visualize from start to end what are all the

53
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,940
tools that I use from the birth of a project
to deploying it out to the world.

54
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,030
And we're going to kind of walk through a
little bit of this, but focusing on your developer

55
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,030
workflow.
So I'll just &mdash; we're going to walk through

56
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,000
the current workflow for Web app developers.
And really the way we'll start this off is

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,449
in your shell.
In your shell &mdash; I'll bring mine up right

58
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,210
now.
Cool.

59
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,900
The first thing is I think you should make
it sexy. Feel good about this terminal that

60
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,759
you're typing into. There's a really great
community on GitHub around dot files, configuration

61
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:37,150
files for your bash prompt or your ZHS prompt,
other application configurations. So I encourage

62
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,060
you to go check that out, see what other people
are doing and customize your shell and share

63
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,970
your customizations with other people.
There's a few favorites that I have. One of

64
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:54,970
them is a directory jumper called Z. I'll
show that now. I can jump to any folder that

65
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:59,270
I've been in somewhat recently. I'll jump
over to the modernizer project.

66
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,910
You can type any portion of that word, hit
Z. We jump right into that. Now we'll actually

67
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:11,599
go over to the HTML Please project. Just type
in "Z please," and we jump over into that

68
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:18,599
folder, nice and easy. Cool.
Now, moving on past my shell &mdash; actually,

69
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,660
first, the server alias. This is pretty cool.
This alias, this is just a bit of bash. We

70
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,800
are just firing up a simple Web server, no
big deal. At the same time we're opening up

71
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,800
browser tab. Configurable port if we want,
but we'll default to 8,000 if we want. I'll

72
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:48,169
do that now, type in server. Cool.
And refresh. Yeah, cool, awesome, good.

73
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,599
So we have my local HTML5 Please running right
here.

74
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:59,599
Now, coming back, the next part is the editor.
And the editor, you might have your own preferences.

75
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:09,270
That's fine, but the key to a good editor
is that it's an onion application, which is

76
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,080
to say that there's a nice learning curve
where you can kind of peel back the layers

77
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:20,080
of functionality and kind of grow from novice
to expert at a very easy pace.

78
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,680
So the other thing with an editor is that
more than any other tool, this is where your

79
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,030
investment in time and learning it well and
learning the features inside of it will pay

80
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,490
off huge dividends.
So I'll bring up mine right now.

81
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:42,490
Let's see. I'm actually using Sublime text
and we'll bring this up and move it over here,

82
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:50,190
and we're going to bring up actually my script
for this file.

83
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:58,699
Nice. Cool.
Now, one of the things that I've noticed developing

84
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,550
recently is that I've kind of, like, learned
new tricks, I like some of the features in

85
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,599
this editor. And one of the things that I
added to my editor workflow recently was having

86
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:15,599
linting. And code linting built-in write live.
So I'll show you what I mean right now.

87
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,979
So here I have these three variable declarations.
It's cool. I didn't actually write these three

88
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:30,979
lines, but maybe I'll refactor them a little
bit. Select them. I will align &mdash; that's nice.

89
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:38,430
Good thing. I'll do a multiline select. Move
that over. That's cool. And then I'll go over

90
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:45,150
and fix that. And good.
Now, one of the things that it's helping me

91
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:51,910
out with here is I have this white box right
here and this is linter plug-in that's running

92
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,310
inside Sublime and it's telling me I have
a problem.

93
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:01,110
Now, way down at the bottom it says "H2 is
not defined."

94
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:08,110
And I'm like, but you're right here. Hmm.
And what is the problem in this right here?

95
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:16,330
Yes, my semi colon should be a comma and I
should be stringing my variable declarations.

96
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,210
That's so nice.
Yes. It's cool.

97
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,420
All right. So yeah, I got lifing back and
it was able to, like, save me from an implied

98
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,300
global variable, which we don't want. I probably
would have caught that. It would have been

99
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,580
a syntax error when I refresh the page, but
I'm getting it caught right here immediately.

100
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:41,150
So I like this. In fact, I think code linting
is your first unit test. Typically the first

101
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:47,010
unit test that you might write is the global
there, does this thing exist. And even before

102
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,720
that you get feedback on if it's available.
And in JavaScript this is particularly important.

103
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,090
Some of the languages have rich static analysis
features. JavaScript is a little hairy in

104
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:05,310
that sort of thing, but we have code linting.
I'm using JS right here, and I can get immediate

105
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,780
feedback on is my code syntactically sound
and is there anything that I should watch

106
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,900
out for, like what we just saw?
So one of the parts of this is I really like

107
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,080
getting the realtime feedback. If you've seen
the talk by Brett Victor, Invented on Principle,

108
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,380
one of the things that he talks about is having
immediate feedback between your code and your

109
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,220
results and getting that feedback.
And so I'm going to show a little bit of kind

110
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,870
of what kind of tools provide this sort of
workflow these days.

111
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:44,870
So I'll move this back over here and I'll
open up the style folder or the style sheet

112
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,600
that we have. I think it's style.scss.
So we're using Sass and Compass, and I'm going

113
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:01,170
to jump down to H1.
So what I'm going to do is just make an edit

114
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,190
in the text shadow and we'll just change this
part of the text shadow from this right here

115
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:13,850
up to 41 pixels and save it.
Now, nothing happens. I refresh the page.

116
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,560
Okay, cool. That's good. But I can turn on
this library load extension, which is just

117
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,620
available inside Chrome. It communicates with
the system application back here. And now

118
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,960
any changes that I make are in fact live.
So I make a change, I just hit save. I don't

119
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,440
have to go over and hit refresh. That's good.
So I'll actually just say that that sounds

120
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,540
pretty good. And I will go down here and add
a little bit more functionality.

121
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:49,540
Let's see, I'll do a CSS transition that I
want to see .4 seconds. I'll apply that to

122
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:59,450
all things. And then add a hover state to
it. I think this time we'll do a transform.

123
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,460
Nice.
Okay. So I just hit saved, I come over here

124
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:16,460
with my mouse and &mdash; nice. This is definitely
an improvement and I will be committing this

125
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,410
to the repo right now.
[Laughter]

126
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,740
>>Paul Irish: Or not.
But that's cool. But I'm getting my immediate

127
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:30,740
feedback, so I'm getting my Sass immediately
recompiled on the fly and then my CSS is being

128
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,200
served back to the browser. Without even the
browser refreshing I can change the page,

129
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,130
my scroll position is maintained and just
the style sheet is being swapped in, which

130
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:48,350
is really nice.
All right. So I'm going to show a little bit

131
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,050
of the browser dev tools inside Chrome, some
features that help especially with building

132
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:59,060
applications that you may not be aware of.
The first is sourceURL. And this is a feature

133
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:06,060
that's been in the browser for quite awhile.
This is a little demo set up by Ryan Sutton,

134
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,850
and so we have a little bit of Coffescript
right here in the middle.

135
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,260
I'm going to make a small little edit to this
Coffescript first.

136
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,310
Nice. Cool.
I'll bring up the Chrome dev tools. And &mdash; that's

137
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:30,350
pretty good. Nice.
Now, normally I can take this Coffescript,

138
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:36,110
I can run it through Coffescript.js, compile
it into its JavaScript form, and if I run

139
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:41,600
it, it goes through eval. And normally when
you take text and run it through eval, it

140
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,060
evaluates, but it just kind of disappears
into thin air.

141
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:51,800
SourceURL is a way to basically treat that
as a file. So if you see down at the bottom

142
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,740
I'm adding googleio.js and adding to compile.
Now you see it over here in the Chrome dev

143
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:05,680
tools. And if you look over here we have what
I just added in the Coffescript, now compiled

144
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,500
to JavaScript, and at the side over here is
the sourceURL.

145
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,300
So this little line is indicating, hey, dev
tools. I got this text, I threw it into eval,

146
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,250
but can you treat it as a file? Thanks very
much, that would be great.

147
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:26,580
So this is really nice, too. So not only is
it a file, but I get all the features that

148
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:33,580
I would expect. So let's say break points.
First I'll just make sure that my cube function

149
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,460
is working all nicely.
Yes, good. Cube files 125. At a break point

150
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:46,460
cube of five we break. I can't actually check
the value of X right now. We're looking good.

151
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:54,430
Yes, sure, we'll continue.
Or I can do a live edit. I can immediately

152
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:00,510
change this file on the fly, we'll return
2 from square so now let me ask for a cube

153
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:07,050
and it should be 5 times 2. Cool. And we get
our result, which is 10.

154
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:13,490
So I'm getting live edit and break points
on some JavaScript which was compiled down

155
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:20,490
from Coffescript all on the fly. I'm showing
up as real files. That's pretty nice.

156
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:27,310
Ember actually uses sourceURL to great effect
to &mdash; Ember the JavaScript library, to emulate

157
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:32,420
modules, which is really, really cool.
Another feature I want to show real quick

158
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:39,420
is source maps. So if I bring back open my
local HTML5 Please and view the source, down

159
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,850
at the bottom is my original sources for the
project.

160
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:53,910
Looks like we had some script tags pulling
in a few libraries and then this script.js

161
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:59,770
that I did before, but what really gets served
to the browser is script.min.js, which is

162
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:06,770
minified. My Chrome extension is critifying
this for me, but I really want you to see

163
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,360
that it's minified. Okay, cool. Thank you,
Chrome extension.

164
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,830
All right. So the browser is actually receiving
the minified source, of course,

165
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:25,800
But down at the very bottom of it is a little
indication similar to what we saw with sourceURL,

166
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,380
only this time it's source mapping URL.
And this points over to a map file. And this

167
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,790
map file does &mdash; basically takes the identifiers
in this compiled source and maps it back to

168
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,430
my original sources and says these are the
files.

169
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,760
And so what I can get are the results.
I open up my dev tools and instead of seeing

170
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,420
script.min.js I see my original sources all
in here.

171
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:57,420
And the cool thing is that the same thing
works over here. Here's my nice edits that

172
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,500
I made. I can apply break points and click
on any &mdash; and now we're actually broken in

173
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,939
my original source even though the browser
is interpreting the minified version. So this

174
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,540
is great for an environment like production
where you're serving up the compiled sources,

175
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,420
but you want to be able to debug the original
things you typed up.

176
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,390
All right. Cool.
Lastly, if you noticed, this might look a

177
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,880
little different to you. First of all, the
dev tools are on the right-hand side. If you

178
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,630
open up the settings panel which is down here
in the bottom right, we have a few things

179
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:39,790
in there. So doc to right, which moves it
over there. Really like it in doc to right

180
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:46,790
mode. We have our step to bugging on the right-hand
side and I can get that out of the way. My

181
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,450
file's over here and I can get that out of
the way and view my scripts in their full

182
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,950
glory. I can also jump to different scripts.
Instead of using this menu I can kind of hit

183
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:03,950
Command O and see all those scripts that are
available. It's kind of get completion there.

184
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,150
Or Command Shift O and see all the functions
that are defined in this file, and now I'll

185
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,200
just bind &mdash; yes, the sort function is what
I'm looking for. I can jump immediately to

186
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,080
that definition.
So a lot of nice things to make dealing with

187
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,700
a large JavaScript code base a bit easier
instead of the dev tools.

188
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:32,700
All right. Now, I wonder about testing for
a moment. And this right here is actually

189
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:40,160
a picture from a series that we have up in
the bathrooms at the Googleplex in Mountain

190
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:47,730
View, California. The series is called Testing
on the Toilet. So each week there's a new

191
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,490
sheet that gives you some good tips for writing
test against your software. Good reading material,

192
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,190
too.
But it's important to write unit tests, so

193
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,500
I have a few ideas here.
First is that you should author your test

194
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,130
in whatever you feel most comfortable in,
so these days for JavaScript it would probably

195
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:14,130
be Jasmine Q unit or mocha. They all have
kind of different assertion styles, and find

196
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:21,060
whichever you like and you feel comfortable
writing those assertions in. Build up a large

197
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,820
test suite and then it feels so nice as a
security blanket when you're doing refactoring.

198
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,720
The other thing is you can execute these tests
that you've written in a variety of different

199
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,880
sessions, so like &mdash; settings. The first one
is, of course, in the browser, so this is

200
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,880
the HTML5 test suite. Run inside Q unit, inside
the browser. Pretty common. You can also run

201
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:51,310
the same tests inside a headless browser,
on demand, on the command line, so I'll show

202
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:58,830
that right now, I'll use grunt, which is a
node-based command line tool and type grunt

203
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:05,830
Q unit. So this is actually going to fire
up phantom.js, which is a headless WebKit

204
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:11,640
instance, toss in those Q unit test suite
and then check that those indeed five assertions

205
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,380
did pass. So I'm able to run the exact same
tests just without leaving my command line

206
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:24,350
here. I can also run this &mdash; run tests after
I push it up to version control, and let something

207
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,670
like continuous integration server test these
things, so we do this on the modernizer project.

208
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:34,760
So this is Travis. Every time we put up a
new commit on GitHub, Travis comes in, pulls

209
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,540
down the latest, and actually does a similar
thing, it takes our Q unit test, throws it

210
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,830
into phantom.js, and then &mdash; and then we're
looking good. It tells us if we're indeed

211
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:52,830
passing or had a little bit where I made some
commits and broke some things. We fixed that.

212
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,220
It's good. Another cool one. This is really
nice, again, from Ryan Setton. He wrote a

213
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,460
tool where we can take tests, not only get
results on the command line, but be able to

214
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:11,460
test browsers in the cloud, so I'm going to
take this same test suite that's in Q unit,

215
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,380
and toss it to bunyup, and bunyup will then
take that and call up a browser static, which

216
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,170
has a lot of browsers in the cloud and also
mobile emulators. I'm not going to wait for

217
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:30,620
this finish, but it just called up some IOS
emulators, and it's gonna &mdash; and it can check

218
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,930
my test suite against those and get the results
back.

219
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:39,080
So this is really nice. I can write my tests,
be able to execute them, in a number of different

220
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:46,080
devices and browsers on the fly without ever
leaving right here. All right. When you have

221
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,320
a build system, you wrote all this stuff,
you need to get it out to production. A lot

222
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,430
of things you need to do with a pretty hefty
Web app, and tackling all of these on your

223
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,140
own every time &mdash; every time you make changes
is not going to work out so well, so you're

224
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,870
going to need some help. I'm going to get
into a little bit of this later. But after

225
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,750
you deploy, one of the things that I think
that we often forget is keeping track of your

226
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:16,920
errors that clients have. So this is a screen
shot from errorception, and it's showing my

227
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:23,920
report from a Web app that I somewhat hastily
put up with some friends, and telling me that

228
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:31,050
I actually have &mdash; people are hitting some
JavaScript errors in I9 and Chrome, and, you

229
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,450
know, I didn't hit any of these errors, and
none of the other developers did, but &mdash; but

230
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,690
real users in the field are hitting these,
so I can get these reports and make sure that

231
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:47,690
I can fix all these for everyone. Okay. So
that was a lot of stuff, and sorry, but &mdash; so

232
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,640
I was showing a lot of things, and it was
kind of like this is here, this is here, and

233
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,020
the feeling that I got was that this was kind
of like &mdash; I mean, there's a lot of tools,

234
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:06,620
and they're all useful, but they kind of didn't
have this smooth integration, so me and some

235
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,490
people on my team thought about this and we
thought maybe there's something that we could

236
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,970
do to kind of make this work flow a bit more
smooth. And so I'm going to talk to you today

237
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:22,970
about a project that we're going to show off
called Yeoman. So the ideas behind Yeoman

238
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,210
is that we think you should be able to go
from your idea to a rough prototype in ten

239
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,960
minutes. I say "rough", but I mean like a
prototype that you're actually going to continue

240
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,260
developing, like you're using all the tools
inside that prototype that you would normally

241
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,190
use in a Web app, and you're going to keep
going from that. We also want to make sure

242
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,880
that we can reduce friction from the things
that you should be doing, such as testing.

243
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,280
And now, you probably heard that you should
not repeat yourself when you're coding; same

244
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,190
thing applies to your tools. You shouldn't
have to type &mdash; you shouldn't have to run

245
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:02,190
build.sh every single time you change a file.
So these things should be automatic. So what

246
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:09,940
Yeoman is is it's an open source set of tools,
frameworks, libraries, that accelerate building

247
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:15,630
good Web apps. So has some things in it, so
authoring abstractions, linting, testing,

248
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:21,750
build tools, these things that I've been talking
about, but we've been focusing on providing

249
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,760
nice, smooth developer ergonomics so it feels
good to use. So there's a few things inside

250
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,610
of it. Things &mdash; these names you should be
familiar with: Compass, sass, CoffeeScript,

251
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:40,610
module support, by the way of AMD, and ecmascript
6. We'll get to that in a minute. Twitter

252
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:46,210
bootstrap, stripped HTML5 boilerplate, some
testing things, Jasmine, phantom jas, image

253
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:51,230
compression. All right. So I'm going to do
a demo and I'm actually going to skip the

254
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:57,180
first step, the first step is a little shell
script that gets your developer environment

255
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:04,180
all set and going, gets you installed with
node and NPM and home brew. Get a few of the

256
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,809
dependencies out of the way. You're going
to want, because, you know, sometimes I'll

257
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:12,390
end up switching to a new machine, and getting
your own developer environment going takes

258
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:16,809
awhile. So we wanted to make sure that you
could get rid of that &mdash; an old set in a few

259
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:23,809
minutes. All right. So I'm going to go to
temp. Nice. All right. We're going to kick

260
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:34,220
off a new project. So a lot of what we have
in Yeoman is accessible on the command line,

261
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:41,040
and so I can just type Yeoman command, and
we have a few things available in here. We

262
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,880
have init, build, server, test, and some other
stuff we're going to get to later. So what

263
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,490
we're going to do here is we're going to start
a new project. I'll name this project IO app.

264
00:25:53,490 --> 00:26:00,490
And inside our app, we're going to type Yeoman
in it. Cool. So we're starting off a new project.

265
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,480
Things are good. It's going to ask us a few
questions. What's the name of the project.

266
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,520
Description. It's going to pull a little bit
of the get metadata from my get config, so

267
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,130
some of these defaults probably will make
sense for me. And that's good. Now, it's going

268
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,420
to take all of this and create a nice little
package .json file which I might want. Now

269
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:27,710
there's a few things it's going to ask me
if I want. Do I want Twitter bootstrap? Yeah.

270
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:33,140
Required JS? I'll pull that in for now. And
experimental support for ecmascript 6 modules,

271
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:39,380
let's do it. All right. I say yes, we get
a bunch of files written and we're good. Just

272
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,950
to show kind of what this created, I'm going
to take a tree and pipe it through to Les,

273
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:50,950
so let's see, we've got a good deal of bootstrap
here, and then bootstrap &mdash; a little bit of

274
00:26:53,320 --> 00:27:00,320
HTML5 boilerplate going on here, some more
bootstrap, Jasmine going on down here. Cool.

275
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:08,180
Now &mdash; now, the next thing I'm just going
to open this up inside my text editor, and

276
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:18,020
so we have here a little stripped version
of HTML5 boilerplate and I'll add in some

277
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:25,020
text, and I'm actually just going to use a
little bit of zen coding to save some time.

278
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Nice. Hello I/O. Yeoman in action. Now, we
have a server built into Yeoman. And the cool

279
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:44,550
thing here is that we're actually taking &mdash; because
when you run a server, you actually want to

280
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:49,010
be able to watch your changes too. So you
set up a server. It immediately actually opens

281
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:56,010
up that result inside the browser as well,
and you're off. So now I'm going to open up

282
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:04,210
my style sheet. All right. And we have in
here, we're going to pull in Twitter bootstrap,

283
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:11,210
and I'll bring that in here, and now watch
as I hit save on this file. Hit save. I'll

284
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,760
watch task. Notice that it immediately changes.
And then we run it through compass, we hit

285
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,330
the reload task and you saw that it changes
up here. So I'm now able to add whatever I

286
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:32,330
want inside my text editor, and get immediate
results down at the bottom, or in my browser.

287
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:41,160
So do a little bit of styles here. Save. That
looks pretty good. A little bit of color over

288
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:49,510
here. Save. Nice. Cool. So I'm able to just
go run all this immediately through Coffee

289
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:59,120
Script &mdash; sorry, through compass, compile
it down to my resulting CSS and then get the

290
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,650
results immediately showing over here. The
cool thing is that we're actually not even

291
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:09,370
using any sort of Chrome extension to get
the lab reload functionality inside &mdash; inside

292
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:16,360
the view in my browser. Now, this is cool,
and I wanted to bring up testing, because

293
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,150
I mentioned that before. We can just go over
to slash test, and we have our Jasmine test

294
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:26,150
suite, all green, looking good, we see in
the browser, looks good. Like I said before,

295
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:33,809
I think it's really nice to have this available
at the command line two, so we'll type in

296
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:38,500
Yeoman test. We're going to take that jasmine
suite and throw it into phantom.js and get

297
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:45,500
our same passing results. Cool. I should mention
here that we're using grunt again to use a

298
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:54,800
lot of this system level functionality. It's
a great project for this sort of thing, and

299
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:02,610
we're leaning heavily on it. All right. Cool.
Now, let's move over to another project. I

300
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:11,630
want to bring up this application, and we'll
kick it off right now. Bring this up. Nice.

301
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:22,720
All right. So this should look pretty familiar
to you. This is your standard to-do app. Common

302
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:30,679
&mdash; a large portion of this came from the to
do MBC project where you can see a basic to

303
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:37,679
do app built in a number of different frameworks
and libraries. So let's see, go to I/O, do

304
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,679
a talk. Nice. Cool. So we've got this basic
functionality, and that's good. I want to

305
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,940
show a little bit of how this was built. So
right inside here, we view source, and we're

306
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,940
pulling in required.js and the main module
that we're pulling in is main. And so I'm

307
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,030
actually going to take a quick detour and
talk about modules. All right. So modules,

308
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:12,990
the quick elevator pitch on modules is that
the key to building a large Web app is to

309
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:19,980
not construct a large Web app; it is to break
it up into small libraries and small parts.

310
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:26,190
Writing code into small files feels good,
and we can do that when we use modules. With

311
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,330
structured modules we can also define what
our dependencies are, and when we do this,

312
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,190
we're actually able to just define our dependencies
a single time, so let's say we're not using

313
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:41,940
modules, so you would probably have your HTML
file, you would have bunch of script tags

314
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,580
in the order that they need to be in, and
then you have your build system which is going

315
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,500
to, you know, concatenate all your files,
and you have to specify your order and your

316
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,860
dependencies over there as well. Modules we
can only &mdash; we can just define that structure

317
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:01,860
just in one place. Another advantage is that
as you develop, you might stop using code,

318
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:09,679
and in modules, code you stop using just gets
stripped out when it goes out to builds. So

319
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,870
there's a few different ways to write modules,
and I'm going to show two of them here. The

320
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:19,809
first is AMD modules, so these are asynchronous
modules. They have dependency resolution,

321
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:26,720
help you to not write global variables, and
it has a very rich plug-in ecosystem that

322
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,720
I'm going to show as well as smart-build optimization.
So this is an example of, let's say, a to

323
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:41,040
do controller, and we're going to pull in
this file, and bring it in to our app as a

324
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,200
to do view, and then our to do controller
is going to return an object that includes

325
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,970
some stuff and then a render method. All right.
Cool. Now, on to the next module. This is

326
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:59,260
ES 6 modules, ecmascript 6 also ecmascript
harmony.

327
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Now, this is actually coming from ecmascript
committee, TC39, who thought that, you know,

328
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,260
people were kind of doing this in the JavaScript
world; let's find a way to make this actually

329
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:17,260
happen in the language itself, so offering
a native solution. Has a flexible syntax,

330
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:23,559
beyond what we have just down here, so what
we have is we're pulling in a module called

331
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:29,679
"to do view", from this file, and importing
it into this file, we have some functionality,

332
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,799
and then we can export whatever we want, so
in this case we're going to export a function

333
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:39,799
called render where we do some stuff. Actually
point out I am saying ES 6. There is a little

334
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:45,870
bit of conversation happening like right now
about if this is going to make it into ecmascript

335
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:52,360
version 6 or the next version after that,
so we'll see how that goes. But we wanted

336
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:59,360
to experiment with this, and see if Yeoman
could give us an ability to try out this style.

337
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:07,540
So back to &mdash; back to the code. I said that
this was using required.js, so I'm going to

338
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:15,359
open up the &mdash; our source of this app, and
I'll open up main.js. So this is the module

339
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:25,030
it's pulling in, and looks like we're initializing
an app right after we pull in the task app

340
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:32,030
module, and we have a little coffee script
pre-filter on this, so looks like &mdash; all right,

341
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:40,669
cool. So this is indeed AMD, but it is of
course CoffeeScript. You can see at the top

342
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:50,280
we're playing in a few other modules into
this file, and then we have our application

343
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:57,070
set up where we're defining our structure
of our to dos. Now, one of these modules that

344
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:04,070
we're pulling this is this fun module, nice.
And we're pulling it in with an HM pre-filter,

345
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:12,130
stands for harmony. So I'm going to go over
to that real quick. Fun. All right. So this

346
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:20,060
here is an ecmascript harmony module. We are
pulling a few things into it. So we're pulling

347
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:28,460
in speech, from &mdash; from this guy over here,
and this is actually the E speak speech synthesizer

348
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:36,380
client, and the cool thing about this speech
synthesizer is that it's actually written

349
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,800
in C++, but it was run through emscripten
which is a research project by Mozilla that

350
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,800
can port C++ into JavaScript, and so now we're
taking that and we're exposing it through

351
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:57,950
ecmascript harmony modules and bringing that
out, so we pull in this module, and we also

352
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:03,570
got this guy going on here, and down here
we're going to use this speech module at the

353
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:10,570
bottom, and pull out this speak method. Cool.
Coming back into our app. I can see down here

354
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:19,540
when we create a new item, I'm going to uncomment
out this guy, and comment out this guy. Nice.

355
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:29,339
Come back here, and refresh the page. Good.
And now let's try this out.

356
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:36,339
>>> Remember to ace the demo.
>>Paul Irish: Yeah. Nice, cool. So nailed

357
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:43,850
it. Awesome. All right. So the cool thing
here is that we have a C++ library that was

358
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:52,500
ported into JavaScript via emscripten, exposed
via ecmascript 6 module into our CoffeeScript

359
00:36:53,020 --> 00:37:00,020
application compiled down into ecmascript
5 JavaScript, and now we've got a (indiscernible),

360
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:08,270
so I think we're in a good place. Cool. All
right. One of the things that we wanted to

361
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,840
do with Yeoman is find out how we can iterate
on it in a way that kind of was based on how

362
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:21,530
people are using it. So we have a thing in
there that can report exactly anonymous metrics

363
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:27,780
around what are the commands that are typed
in, so any kind of Yeoman commands, and this

364
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,430
way we can get a better idea on how people
are using it, so they can make good changes

365
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:38,410
and really make sure that the tool fits its
users. Another thing that it can do is answer

366
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:44,580
questions like what's the popularity difference
between backbone and ember, or what's the

367
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:51,060
adoption rate of ES 6 modules?
So I think this is really cool. And we also

368
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,109
want to make sure that all this &mdash; all this
data is accessible to anyone that wants to

369
00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:02,109
see it. I want to take a moment just to talk
about package management. So I don't know

370
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:09,630
about you guys, but if I have to update like
a library that I depend on somewhere, the

371
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:15,760
first thing that happens is someone probably
tells me, hey, that Jay creates 1.5 up to

372
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,260
1.8 alpha. You should probably update. Okay,
okay. I'll go to the site, I'll find the download

373
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,060
button, and I'll download that to my downloads,
then I'll move that into the app folder, and

374
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,650
then I'll like fix the script tag because
it's a new version file and fix that, and

375
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:36,650
that's &mdash; that's not great, so why do we need
package management for clientside JavaScript?

376
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:42,490
Because what I just described is not fun.
And then more like an Ecosystem level, common

377
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:48,200
code gets duplicated across a good size app,
you probably have code to bind a function

378
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,160
to a scope like four times. Another thing
that happens is that libraries get fragmented.

379
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,940
This is why we have things like the jQuery
empire and then the YUI and dojo and closure

380
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:05,510
areas where things are not really interoperable,
and we have fragmented communities and libraries.

381
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:12,510
So with package management, we can have something
like a longer dependency chain. A good example

382
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,210
of this is the Chaplin project which helps
building applications in backbone. Chaplin

383
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:23,660
depends on backbone and some other libraries
which depend on jQuery and underscore. That

384
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:30,320
comes really easy. Better package management,
we can define that dependency tree which informs

385
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,340
a build system to be really smart about building
that out for a very optimized output for production.

386
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,680
Then as a library author, it's really nice
for your users to both consume your library

387
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,770
as a regular old install and also as a dependency
of something else. How about instead of all

388
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:51,130
of those steps, we just have something Yeoman
installed backbone, we have to update it instead

389
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,619
of all of these steps, Yeoman, very casually,
hey, man, JavaScript library update, you have

390
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:02,619
got to update your backbone, it's the new
thing. You're like, cool, cool, I got it,

391
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,859
Yeoman, update backbone.
So I'm going to show you a quick look at Bower.

392
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:15,859
Bower is a package manager, it's being built
by Jacob Thorton, who is one of the devs behind

393
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:22,070
Twitter bootstrap and Alex MacCaw behind The
Spine (indiscernible).

394
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:29,070
And what we did is we basically took Bower
and wrapped it right inside of Yeoman so that

395
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:37,900
again this accesses through the same interface.
So we're over here in the I/O app and we'll

396
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,520
do Yeoman install backbone.
So right now, what it's doing, is Yeoman is

397
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:55,730
talking to Bower, Bower is going to go and
talk to the registry, say, Hey, I need backbone,

398
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:02,380
cool. I just got the backbone package, it's
dependent &mdash; my dependencies are underscore

399
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,720
and jQuery, please get those, okay, cool,
got those.

400
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,369
And now we've installed into our app into
the js browser modules backbone jQuery and

401
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:17,530
underscore.
So if I go into js browser modules, we have

402
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:22,070
all of our files right there.
So I'm saving a lot of time not going and

403
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,670
getting all of these things and keeping them
up to date. I'm able to manage my dependencies

404
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:30,830
from my app right here on the command line,
which is really nice.

405
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:36,980
So this is &mdash; this is where things are going
with that. So &mdash; so in summary for Yeoman,

406
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:43,240
we can start out new projects really easily.
We get a fast, iterative loop when we are

407
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:50,240
doing development. Understanding preprocessors
like Sass and CoffeeScript, module systems

408
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,570
like AMD and ES6.
I didn't show how we can run our files against

409
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:05,570
js hint. Or even the build script, which is
pretty robust. It's built actually on the

410
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:11,020
original build script for the HTML5 boilerplate.
But we have done a lot of research into image

411
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:17,950
optimization and found the most effective
loss list image compression we can do.

412
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:23,580
So Yeoman is available on the dev val for
preview, if you go to Yeoman.io you can sign

413
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:30,090
up and get notified when it's totally ready.
We're just doing a little bit of buckling

414
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:34,750
to make sure that we're looking good. We also
want to make sure that our package manager

415
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,359
has enough packages so that when you want
to start an app and add things, everything

416
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:43,200
is there for you as you want it.
So we're letting in a few people, just to

417
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,030
kind of kick the tires and we'll have it out
available for everyone publicly soon.

418
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,380
All right. So ... summary. Tools are your
friends, they're good, they increase your

419
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,690
productivity, lower your stress, help you
out when you use them in a work flow that

420
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:02,080
works really well for you. We're working on
Yeoman. Tell &mdash; make it easier to consume

421
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,970
these smart tooling choices and help you build
compelling web apps.

422
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:10,580
And thank you very much.

423
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:17,580
>>Paul Irish: If you have any questions, go
ahead and step up to the mics in the aisles

424
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:36,310
and that would be rad.
>>> Thanks, Paul.

425
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:44,340
>>Paul Irish: You're welcome.
>>> So Paul.

426
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,810
>>Paul Irish: Sir?
>>> I saw Jasmine, is there going to be other

427
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:54,970
testing like plug-ins or &mdash;
>>Paul Irish: So since we are built on &mdash; on

428
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:01,970
Grunt, if you are familiar with that, swapping
it out for &mdash; for a different testing suite

429
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:09,960
is as easy as editing the Grunt file. So it's
not too bad. But we &mdash; we made choices that

430
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:16,440
&mdash; we wanted to have some smart defaults in
there, so we went with Jasmine because we

431
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,260
really like its style. So it is configurable,
but we wanted to have something that gets

432
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,080
you off and going from the start.
>>> Awesome.

433
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,920
>>Paul Irish: Cool.
>>> Can I get an invite? [Laughter]

434
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,810
>>Paul Irish: Yeah, yeah.
You talk to me, talk to me.

435
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:40,930
>>> Um, when you &mdash; after you installed Yeoman
and you were making changes, changes were

436
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,440
loading in the browser, was that live reload
or was that something in Yeoman?

437
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:51,440
>>Paul Irish: So we are actually leveraging
the JavaScript shim that the live reload project

438
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:59,450
used and we're injecting that into the page.
And so we're using a portion of the live reload,

439
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,190
but it's really just JavaScript that's making
that happen.

440
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,359
>>> Okay. So ensure one doesn't have to have
live reload to have that feature.

441
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:12,450
>>Paul Irish: Right. That feature comes through
Yeoman, so you don't even have to have anything

442
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,730
else installed yet.
>>> Okay, thanks.

443
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,020
>>> So you showed us the testing and the development
side. I'm guessing part of the build process

444
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:24,250
that you didn't have time to show us was building
for deployment. Would that also include being

445
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:31,250
able to use the closure compiler to have source
mapping? Um ... yeah. Right now, um &mdash; right

446
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:40,300
now our build step goes through uglify, but
we're looking at a nice way to run it through

447
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:47,760
a closure compiler, because I like source
maps just as much as you do. So there's &mdash; there's

448
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,070
a few issues and discussions open to get source
mapping into Uglify and to CoffeeScript, neither

449
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:58,060
of them have landed yet. So we're waiting
for that, but in the meantime, yeah, I would

450
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,430
really love to find a nice way to get source
maps into the closure compiler.

451
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:06,400
>>> Right. And there was an issue around having
multiple source maps and trying to read from

452
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,800
each other. I'll catch you at the code lab.
>>Paul Irish: Sure, yeah, sounds good. Sir?

453
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,800
>>> All right. What kind of requirements do
I need &mdash; for my server when I want to deploy

454
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:27,030
this Yeoman created app?
>>Paul Irish: Um, no specific requirement.

455
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:34,030
It's completely up to you. So &mdash; so it's &mdash; it's
basically we don't make any requirements as

456
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:39,520
far as your back end. It stays completely
client side only whereas another solution

457
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,510
might say this is your database on the backend
or we're going to serve it up to Engine X

458
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,849
or something like that, but that is completely
up to you.

459
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:52,759
>>> I see. Okay.
>>Paul Irish: Yes, sir, one more.

460
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:59,759
>>> This one is for Louie. So how much do
you know about like the Bower package manager,

461
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:05,730
how hard is it going to be to get a package
into it?

462
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,630
I noticed that it looked like it was cloning,
so if you push that back up to GitHub, like,

463
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:16,630
is there like weird issues?
>>Paul Irish: Um ... well, I can answer the

464
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:22,390
first part at least.
So it was previously called nest and I'm accessing

465
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:29,390
it, this way. And registering a new package
is as easy as that. Bower. Register the name

466
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:39,480
and the URL of the get repo. It's very, very
easy and there's a package.json file that

467
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,170
has the meta data available for the package.
There's no strict dependency on GitHub, but

468
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:51,170
there is a strict dependency on git, and clone
each package, find out its dependencies and

469
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:58,410
the team is finding ways to optimize that
and say, for instance, grab the zip download

470
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:05,410
if it's a GitHub situation instead of cloning
the entire repo, finding out how to make that

471
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,460
really nice.
Cool? All right. Thank you guys, appreciate

472
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:08,710
it.
