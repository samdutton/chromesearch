1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,950
>>Alex Komoroske: Let's get started.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Let's get started. So what

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,950
the heck of Web components?
>>Alex Komoroske: So When you guys saw that

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,140
word component, you probably thought what
is that? Well, I submit that each and every

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:25,140
one of you know what a component is because
you use them today. You use them in lots of

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,760
different cases. So the first case is in embedded
widgets. So here if you have a Google+ button

6
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:56,350
inside your site or a like button or something
like that &mdash;

7
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:07,419
>> Dimitri Glazkov: Or a Twitter button.
>>Alex Komoroske: This is a third-party bit

8
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,500
of code that's running within your site. It's
something where you have trust issues, right?

9
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:30,060
They don't want to allow you to mess with
all of their stuff or (indiscernible) privileged

10
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:41,039
APIs, and they also don't want you to style
their stuff. So they talk a lot about discipline.

11
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:53,429
Like, "Thou shalt not use anything under &mdash; sell
anything under my little ID" and stuff like

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,659
that.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right, and of course we

13
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,659
as user of those widgets go, "Eh, it's more
like an etiquette." Try not to do that stuff

14
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:26,050
and we'll mess with that the way we want to
to make it look nice.

15
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,020
>>Alex Komoroske: And so in fact, what everybody
does, they give up on these iframes, but that's

16
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,040
not really ideal.
So another use case is when you are writing

17
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:27,260
your own app, and say you want a tabstrip,
well, you shouldn't have to create a tabstrip

18
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,540
because there are thousands of them that other
people have created; you just want to use

19
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:44,870
those.
So you just want to grab in a widget or a

20
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:50,950
component that someone else has written, and
put it inside of your app.

21
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,950
>>Dimitri Glazkov: And there are entire libraries
written nowadays, and some of them are quite

22
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,850
complete, libraries, and widgets and all of
the different UI elements that you might want

23
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,760
to put together.
And of course, unfortunately, the problem

24
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,760
there is that all of these libraries espouse
their own strategy on how to execute the UI

25
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:26,140
widget composition and how those things come
together. And so like one of the top stock

26
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,200
overflow
questions would be how do I use the widget

27
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,060
from Framework Foo in Framework R, right?
>>Alex Komoroske: Unfortunately, they follow

28
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:45,060
different conventions, so often the answer
is you use a lot of duct tape, a lot of script,

29
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:55,870
jam them together as best you can.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Don't touch those parts.

30
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:04,420
>>Alex Komoroske: And don't do this, whatever
you do. So the final one is custom-built widgets.

31
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Are you hungry? So bear with me for a second.
You are all familiar with spaghetti code,

32
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:21,270
right? Where you have all of these crazy stuff
to do, really hacky. When you are writing

33
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:29,090
your own apps, you want to have this better
fit of encapsulation, right? Because that's

34
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,880
how you build more complex things. But it's
hard to do in the above platform, so the best

35
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,720
that you can kind of get is lasagne. You've
got layers, but they're still kind of messy,

36
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,720
right? So even when you are building any kind
of app, you are building these custom elements

37
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,190
for yourself.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: The components is, you

38
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:20,190
know, one use of that.
>>Alex Komoroske: So let's go dive into our

39
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,960
example we will be talking through today.
We're going to build a poll app and show you

40
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,200
how we built this today. So here it is. It's
a pretty app.

41
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,919
It's got a cool HTML file logo, it's got a
title, a subtitle, different options. If you

42
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:04,320
aren't familiar with them, you can hover over
them to see the information about them. You

43
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:12,960
can select them. I selected things. You can
also see the results. See what other people

44
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,360
have voted for. But let's dive into how this
stuff actually

45
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,139
works. So I'm going to open up Web inspector
here,

46
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,710
I have got this way zoomed in, which is why
it looks so funky.

47
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,480
>>Dimitri Glazkov: And if you look at this
today, and this is a written &mdash; you know,

48
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,480
this is a pretty cutting edge technology even
by today's standard. Shout out for David who

49
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,550
wrote this code. It's using what you would
call the modern

50
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:54,050
principles of Web design, and that is, you
know, you do see your components right away.

51
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,050
You see the poll is one component, which is
a backbone view; and then you see the choices

52
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,310
view, results view, and all of those different
things that are put together into a widget

53
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,030
hierarchy of some sort, right? Unfortunately,
some of the things immediately

54
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,889
start jumping out at you and going what's
going on here?

55
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:22,190
See those strings there? Your HTML became
just a string, right? It's not a markup anymore.

56
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,180
It's just the cottage cheese in your Lasagne,
right?

57
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,350
And so at this point you are starting to go
and say, "Well, I'm not really working in

58
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,779
HTML anymore; I'm working in this parallel
world that the framework has designed for

59
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,909
me. And then what happens is this framework
will do the right thing and project the actual

60
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,289
HTML or DOM tree into the browser for user
to see. And, of course, when the user clicks

61
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:50,079
on something, the backward thing happens,
you know. The framework traverses the events

62
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:57,079
back to your tree to your object hierarchy
and tells you what happened. It's not just

63
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,029
the deal that was clicked; it's your poll
that was selected.

64
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:07,029
Ah-ha, I understand this now. So if you look
at this markup right now, you actually see

65
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:11,660
this very clearly. It's that markup is not
necessarily representative of what the poll

66
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,629
is; it's actually a lot of things in addition
to just what should be a very simple widget

67
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:22,869
layout, right? You have poll and you have
choices and that's it. What else should be

68
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:29,869
going on here? But there is actually a lot
of markup going on. That's because the markup

69
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,649
is essentially a projection. And even worse,
today, if you load this page, it's just a

70
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,980
DIV in markup. What happens is the framework
then blows up

71
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,680
this DIV using the JavaScript and creates
the actual framework out of it.

72
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,279
So &mdash; you think this is bad?
>>Alex Komoroske: Right. So I actually have

73
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,019
something that haunts my nightmares, and it
will haunt yours, too, after I show you.

74
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:08,009
So if you open &mdash; if you go to, say, just
Gmail which we all use, know and love, if

75
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:14,100
you switch and look at the Web inspector in
here, you inspect some random elements &mdash; what

76
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,029
is going on?
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Oh, my God! What is this?

77
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:27,029
This should be a very simple widget tree,
right? There's like a list of things and then

78
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,639
there's &mdash; oh, my God look at this! Stairway
to hell. [Laughter]

79
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,300
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right? What's going on
there?

80
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,920
>>Alex Komoroske: This doesn't make any sense.
And so &mdash; this is in this bizarro. You know,

81
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,920
I bet a lot of you watching this were saying,
"Oh, well that's just how you do it, right?"

82
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:55,449
Like, why are you talking about why this is
insane? This is just how you make it work.

83
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,480
You know what, Dimitri? I submit that everyone
in this room who said that is insane. Right?

84
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,110
[Laughter].
>>Alex Komoroske: This is insane, this is

85
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,319
crazy.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: We're insane, yay! All

86
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:21,319
right. But the thing is that &mdash; it is true,
we are

87
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:28,660
doing something to work around the issues
in the browser. And we're writing a lot of

88
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:36,350
code. We're writing frameworks to help us
do this &mdash; these bits of code. Then with more

89
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:45,300
code that we write, we have more opportunities
for &mdash; for losing test coverage, for example,

90
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:52,300
and not knowing exactly what's happening.
And clearly more code you ship over the wire,

91
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:03,220
the slower your application will go, right?
And the development time suffers, of course.

92
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,839
Unless you stay in the confines of that specific
framework, right?

93
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:16,839
>>Alex Komoroske: So that's sort of on a low
level why this is bad. On a high level, this

94
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:26,189
is bad, too. Right? If you looked at this
DOM, this isn't very

95
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:33,189
symmetric at all. I had to look through it.
I didn't really understand what those things

96
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,220
were doing. The Gmail example, of course,
is way on one end of the spectrum. But actually

97
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,869
if we look at our index, Google, we see the
Web is getting less and less semantic as we

98
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:51,470
go. There's more DIVs and spans. It's harder
to understand what's going on.

99
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,089
>>Dimitri Glazkov: And more empty DIVs, like
I mentioned before, right? You try to index

100
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:04,589
a page, you go there, you say, oh, there's
nothing there, no, no, that's actually an

101
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,619
NPR app but loads all kinds of images. You
have to run script to understand that it does

102
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:17,189
that, right?
>>Alex Komoroske: So running script means

103
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:24,189
that you have to &mdash; to make any kind of complicated
app, you have to run script. You can't be

104
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,980
a web author; you have to be a Web developer
to make something work today. Okay. So I have

105
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:47,569
one bit of good news. You guys are all insane,
but it's not your

106
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:55,179
fault. It's the fault of the platform right
now and that's why you have to do these things.

107
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,420
>>Dimitri Glazkov: That's right.
>>Alex Komoroske: So if you look at this,

108
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:14,420
the rare thing of it, is the Web platform
has all of these amazing technologies that

109
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,499
do all kinds of really cool stuff. But there
are a few little potholes. A few little tiny

110
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:28,329
things that don't work correctly or that are
difficult. And you run into them. You're on

111
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:32,790
this information super highway, everything
is working great, you run into a pothole,

112
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,619
and you say, "Ooop, I can't handle this."
But that's okay.

113
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:44,239
I have script, I have an escape hatch. I will
do this in JavaScript. It will be okay. So

114
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:48,329
you go a little tiny bit off road. That's
fine, right?

115
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:50,829
Now you run into another pothole, a deeper
pothole offroad. This means you're offroad,

116
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:53,889
right? And it's a pothole that wouldn't have
been

117
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,049
there had you been on the highway, had you
been able to use these normal technologies,

118
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:02,949
but you're offroad. That's okay. You write
a little bit more script, you go a little

119
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:03,980
bit more offroad. Things are wrong, right?
Unfortunately, this

120
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,170
leads into a pit of despair, right? Like the
more offroad you go, after a certain point

121
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,329
you are drawing your own cursor, you've completely
escaped the browser here.

122
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,299
[Laughter].
>>Alex Komoroske: You are sort of building

123
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:22,499
inside this escape hatch. JavaScript is an
escape hatch. If the (indiscernible) doesn't

124
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:28,899
do what you need, you are now building everything
inside of the escape hatch. That's crazy.

125
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:35,899
Even if you don't think that you are doing
it, you think you are doing a very good job

126
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:44,350
of being semantic and all of that stuff, well,
the framework they are using is doing it for

127
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:49,559
you. They are going completely offroad to
do this kind of stuff.

128
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:55,579
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right. And a lot of this
framework becomes so robust. And in order

129
00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:00,339
to become robust, in order to offer the experience
to you that makes sense, they build entire

130
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:04,709
rendering engines into the browser, so you
have this turducken of the thing. The rendering

131
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:08,569
engine is just a rendering surface, and then
there's another one that's being loaded to

132
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:13,399
the js file that actually does the stuff for
you. And so it's pretty sad.

133
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,859
>>Alex Komoroske: So, yeah, we've been talking
all doom and gloom so far. We're going to

134
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:23,420
turn the page here, and the good news is that
although we look like normal people, Dimitri

135
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,720
and I actually come to you from the future.
[Laughter]

136
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,999
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Yes. We did come from the
future. You must know there are multiple versions

137
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:33,759
of the future, and there is one, for example,
where the alien invasion begins in 15 minutes

138
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,809
and the Web platform essentially becomes irrelevant.
>>Alex Komoroske: But there also good time

139
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:41,079
lines. The time line we're from is the one
where there's free beer and there's Web components,

140
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,109
so it's not all bad. So what we want to do
is we want to talk to

141
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:47,769
you about how Web components solves this problem.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: So the Web components is

142
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:54,769
this new set of technologies that we looked
at &mdash; we created by looking at those potholes

143
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:02,540
and decided to fill them naturally as things
that fit inside of the Web platform as a whole.

144
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:13,470
Rather than building a whole new crazy thing
on the side, which we always have done before,

145
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:19,370
we decided we're going to fill those holes
naturally into something that feels like just

146
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:26,139
part of the Web platform. Just part of the
standard things that you normally do in the

147
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:30,940
browser. Not a script and not some crazy invention
that is completely brand new.

148
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:36,990
And so what we did is we kind of found out
that there's three pieces that are missing

149
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,980
and these pieces are Shadow DOM, the custom
elements, and the templates.

150
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,149
>>Alex Komoroske: So let me walk you through
what each of these ones means in practice.

151
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:52,169
So again, all of these three things are what
come underneath the umbrella of Web components.

152
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:56,340
So the first is Shadow DOM. Shadow DOM is
what allows you to encapsulate stuff in the

153
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,090
DOM to hide away all of that crush that you
need to make it look correct.

154
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:07,090
Custom elements is what allows you to define
your own tabs. When the HTML parser runs into

155
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:11,799
your widget, it can instantiate it immediately
for you.

156
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:17,120
Finally, templates allows you to define HTML
DOM snippets very easily. So today you are

157
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,120
doing this in long bits of strings and script,
or you are doing script tags with some &mdash; with

158
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:33,460
some templates there. This basically just
allows you to define it directly in your HTML,

159
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,460
have it sort of frozen off to the side, so
you can swap it in when you need it.

160
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,279
>>Dimitri Glazkov: It's kind of neat to decide
that developers are &mdash; really like this master

161
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,070
framework, right. There's problems with the
Web platform, but no matter what, developers

162
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,980
force will work around them or flow around
those problems.

163
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,899
>>Alex Komoroske: They will find a way.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Exactly.

164
00:18:54,899 --> 00:19:01,250
>>Alex Komoroske: So this is sort of like
the low level what the technologies do, but

165
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,210
what does this actually mean in practice?
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Well, in practice, what

166
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:09,269
you are really are looking for is something
that allows you to tell &mdash; allows you to tell

167
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:13,510
the browser exactly what you mean. This, for
example, would be the markup that

168
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:20,000
you are actually are trying to communicate
to the browser. I have a poll, I have choices,

169
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and there's things that &mdash; that are essentially
data for my poll, right? Why should there

170
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,500
be anything else? Right, right, right?!!
>>> Right!

171
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:37,470
>>Dimitri Glazkov: All right! So the three
pieces fit very neatly into this idea. First

172
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:44,149
Shadow DOM allows you to take the scaffolding
all of the weird DIVs that are really irrelevant

173
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:49,809
to the semantic of the markup, and hide them
into the Shadow DOM &mdash; which we will talk

174
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:55,350
more about later. Then the custom elements
allow you to define new tags, right? New tags,

175
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:02,350
awesome? X-poll, right? And specify behavior
and assign things on top of them.

176
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:09,340
Then, of course, the templates allow you to
stop treating markup as string, which is always

177
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,730
nice.
>>Alex Komoroske: So that's how they help

178
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,360
tactically, but they also, of course, are
really important on the high level. So if

179
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,580
you have this world, this is all you need
to pass down to the browser to have that rich

180
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,740
poll experience exist, that means that you
don't need this bizarro script. DOM can be

181
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,130
your only hierarchy. You don't need to have
this parallel bizarro hierarchy on the side.

182
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,809
>>Dimitri Glazkov: You no longer need to build
your widget hierarchy as just a, you know,

183
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:37,509
an object tree somewhere off to the side.
The one that projects the DOM is a kabuki

184
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:41,409
theater of some sort.
>>Alex Komoroske: So DOM can become this lingua

185
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:48,409
franca of the Web. It also means that you
would have real encapsulation, so you wouldn't

186
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,419
have to worry about people coming in and messing
with your innards and messing up how your

187
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,690
component works, because they can't because
it would be a barrier.

188
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,049
So it's not just etiquette or discipline.
It's an actual encapsulation barrier. Also

189
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:02,610
if DOM is the composition mechanism, it already
composes really nicely. You can put a span,

190
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,870
DIVs, all kinds of stuff, right? If you have
that as the framework that you

191
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,070
use for composability, that means that you
have compatible composability. So if you have

192
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:18,940
a widget from Framework A and Framework B,
they can live together harmoniously without

193
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,240
having to figure out which widgets they have
&mdash; it's just DOM.

194
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,490
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right. And where that one
widget begins and where one widget ends. That's

195
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,070
another important thing. Let's be clear. Web
components is not a set of those widgets.

196
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,429
It's just a platform on which the future frameworks,
you know, the future where we're from? Can

197
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:36,950
build those new frameworks.
>>Alex Komoroske: So it's a foundation for

198
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,549
this stuff. Okay. So this &mdash; actually, Web
components

199
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:47,549
as you may have guessed, makes all of this
stuff real. So we're going to show you what

200
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,659
it looks like in practice. So let me switch.
This is the demo that we showed; it's built

201
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,090
using the best practices of today. And this
is what the &mdash; what the one with

202
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,299
Web components looks like. Right? Looks exactly
the same.

203
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:08,590
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Yeah. Right. So in the
future, all applications are going to look

204
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,700
exactly the same, right? This is the lesson
that we are learning? Well, actually, no.

205
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,970
What's interesting here, this is actually
a functional application, but instead of all

206
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,779
of these weird spans and DIVs inside of it,
it has a very clear, very concise markup.

207
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:28,009
This markup is exactly the same as the actual
DOM structure off this document, right?

208
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:32,669
So whatever you ship over the wire is exactly
the same thing that is represented as DOM.

209
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,480
You don't have to create this thing that the
frameworks &mdash; the rendering decorate where

210
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,480
you just first load the page and then you
go find those things that you want to upgrade

211
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:50,230
and make them into the right stuff, you don't
have to do that anymore. All of this happens

212
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,210
magically?
>>Alex Komoroske: Magically, that's actually

213
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:58,490
a good point. I was going to ask, clearly
we saw all of the extra stuff that's required

214
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:04,799
to make this poll demo work. But it's not
here, so what's going on? All right. Well,

215
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,610
let's look.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: And kind of the way that

216
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:13,880
you look at this is in the Web platform, we
never had this opportunity to &mdash; to build

217
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,639
in layering. Layering is like a cool thing.
It's not &mdash; it's also related to the lasagne

218
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:21,759
thing. But all of the frameworks, if you look
at

219
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:28,759
them together, all of the JavaScript frameworks
that are built out today are nothing but attempts

220
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:36,100
to provide a layering in the browser. Because
what they want to do is they want to create

221
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,580
an environment in which the users of this
framework don't have to think about the details.

222
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,379
And then the developers of the new widgets,
the builders of the components, the ones who

223
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:45,690
work inside of the framework, actually have
flexibility and power to, you know, provide

224
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:45,940
those new services to the &mdash; to the higher
level.

225
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:51,330
>>Alex Komoroske: By having this built into
the browser, it means that there's no build

226
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,639
step, there's no extra framework you can use,
you might be able to build the users of this

227
00:23:55,639 --> 00:24:02,639
components, which is what the vast majority
of the Web developers will be doing, it's

228
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,200
super simple, you do an import, you use these
tags, it just works, however, if you really

229
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,100
want to understand the magic going on behind
this, you need to go a little bit behind the

230
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,240
scenes, you have to see these more powerful
concepts that are a little bit more confusing

231
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,480
that have a lot more to learn about.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: We have a choice here,

232
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,080
do you guys want to continue or should we
just stop right here, behind the scenes!!??

233
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,870
Yes.
>>Alex Komoroske: Okay. So we're going to

234
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:42,870
go behind the scenes. If at this point you
say what the heck is going on, that's okay,

235
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:47,340
you can just be a user of these components
and not have to worry about it. Dimitri, why

236
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,190
don't you take us behind the scenes?
>>Dimitri Glazkov: First we're going to talk

237
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,429
about Shadow DOM. Believe it or not, Shadow
DOM already exists on the browsers, well and

238
00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:01,269
alive, and the one and good example would
be a video tag. Let's take a look at this

239
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:05,779
video tag right here embedded into this presentation,
because, you know, our presentations are actually

240
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:11,049
HTML as well. Right? Okay. So as you can see
you have really neat video tag right there,

241
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:15,269
right? Video/video, everything looks great,
but there's actually more stuff happening.

242
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:20,129
There's slider there in the time line, and
all these things. How do browser developers

243
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:25,480
do this? Right? How do they draw those things?
Well, they have a couple of choices: One of

244
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,740
them is build the whole thing from scratch
to build their own, testing right into this

245
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,169
thing, and we're kind of actually lazy and
we didn't do that. What we did instead is

246
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:41,580
we invented a way where we could stash away
a DOM tree where we can build those things

247
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,080
out of just normal CSS and DOM, and operate
on them just the normal way, and then we present

248
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,620
it to you as if this is a built-in functionality,
and this DOM tree, we obviously called Shadow

249
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,509
DOM, right?
It's in the shadows.

250
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:52,490
>>Alex Komoroske: So how can we see what's
going on here?

251
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:58,299
>>Dimitri Glazkov: So one of the interesting
things is in Chrome browser, today you can

252
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:04,110
opt in to this experiment and you can say,
well, I want to be able to show Shadow DOM,

253
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,379
and so if you're a load inspector, you will
see that, when you inspect the video, suddenly

254
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:14,029
there's more stuff inside of it. It's that
thing called shadow root. That's that hidden

255
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:19,539
DOM that you can't see. Let's go inside of
it. Oh, there's a DIV. Oh, interesting input

256
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:26,539
type button. That's actually the play button,
and then the input type or this style, open

257
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:34,070
that one right there, that will be a type
range. That's the slider, right? That's the

258
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,220
thing. So what we did is we really,
really cheated in a pretty big way, right?

259
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,679
We just &mdash; instead of building all this stuff
in C++, you know, and all this stuff, it's

260
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,960
just DOM. And, in fact, when you play this
video, and you know how the timeline goes

261
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,350
away, that is just a CSS transition, right?
It's nothing special.

262
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,419
>>Alex Komoroske: So what you're saying is
that this stuff, this isn't new, Shadow DOM

263
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:03,820
has existed in some browsers already. What
is new is exposing it to web developers.

264
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,600
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right. So what we did next,
we said, well, wouldn't it be cool if Web

265
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,990
developers could have the same power, and
wouldn't you agree that would be cool? Would

266
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,320
that be cool?
All right. So that's what Shadow DOM is about.

267
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,889
It's about encapsulation and providing you
with the ability to add these extra chunks

268
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:19,169
on DOM tree and render them as if they're
part of the bigger rendering.

269
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:26,169
>>Alex Komoroske: Okay. This is kind of complicated,
so let's go through this in a little bit more

270
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:29,200
depth.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: All right. Sounds good.

271
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,200
So the next slide here that we see, we have
a nice diagram. As you can see it's peas and

272
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:41,480
radishes, clearly. So the green notes, the
peas represent the document tree, that's the

273
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:48,379
actual tree that you see when you go into
the inspector, and that's the one that is

274
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:53,169
parsed, when the browser parses your markup,
and the pink stuff is the Shadow DOM tree,

275
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:59,409
so the Shadow DOM allows you to associate
a special subtree with every DOM element,

276
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:06,409
and then this subtree, you can build and create
DIVs and all kinds of things inside of it,

277
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,700
but then when it's rendered, you actually
see the shadow subtree rendered instead of

278
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:18,149
the contents of that node, the element that
you associate it with.

279
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:23,429
>>Alex Komoroske: Okay. So let me go over
this one more time. So what we have here on

280
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:29,840
the left, we have these green nodes, or just
the logical DOM that we're all familiar with,

281
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,840
and then off to the right we have a sort of
parallel DOM hierarchy.

282
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:43,769
>>Dimitri Glazkov: That's right.
>>Alex Komoroske: And so it's sort of stashed

283
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:49,960
off to the side. But if the Shadow DOM is
defined, when we render, what we see, is as

284
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,899
though the pink nodes were underneath the
green nodes.

285
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:56,159
>>Dimitri Glazkov: That's right.
>> Alex Komoroske: So magically the green

286
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,070
ones are still there.
>> Dimitri Glazkov: Right. So this is a really,

287
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:07,070
really cool concept right here, it's a render
time composition. You don't have to move those

288
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,749
nodes around. They're still there &mdash; if you
walk your, you know, first child, next child

289
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:15,330
thing, next sibling, there's going to be only
the green tree inside of it, but at render

290
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,799
time, the shadow DOM tree will be placed on
top and rendered as if it's there.

291
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,990
>> Alex Komoroske: I had real stuff in that
&mdash; in that real in the green DOM tree. I want

292
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,700
to show that. It's kind of weird this is sort
of (indiscernible)

293
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,179
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right. Yeah, this use case
is pretty good for a video, but you suddenly

294
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:35,179
lost that other green peas things that were
hanging off the element, so what do we do

295
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,809
there?
We have this really, really cool concept called

296
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:42,470
insertion point. Insertion points are special
elements that you can put into your Shadow

297
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:48,389
DOM subtree to designate where the children
of the shadow root will poke through, and

298
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:52,950
so as you can see there, I have two insertion
points and when it's rendering, again at render

299
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,799
time only, those children will shine through
inside of the Shadow DOM tree, so in a way

300
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,799
it allows you to have this way to compose
the Shadow DOM subtree around your documents

301
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,950
node.
>> Alex Komoroske: This is the same thing

302
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,600
that frameworks are doing today, right, because
you have like your markup, then you call this

303
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:19,600
magic decorate method on it, then it swaps
your DOM directly into the place it needs

304
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:23,460
to be to render.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: That's right.

305
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,830
>>Alex Komoroske: This leaves it in the same
place as before so you can still interact

306
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,279
with it like you did before.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: The cool thing here, exactly

307
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:40,279
right, is that this is entirely render time,
so you don't have to touch the DOM, in fact

308
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:49,190
the DOM stays exactly the same. What happens
is this happens only at render time, so only

309
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:55,899
when this stuff shows up on the page is things
appear in the right spot.

310
00:30:55,899 --> 00:31:02,159
>>Alex Komoroske: Okay. So this is all very
abstract. Let's go through a more concrete

311
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,669
example.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Sure. For example, the

312
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:09,019
<x-choice> element that we have just seen
in the markup example here is implemented

313
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:16,019
using Shadow DOM, so you can see there it's
a very simple subtree. The Shadow DOM subtree

314
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:25,409
has a DIV in it and has a little mask which
stands for the little icon there, but then

315
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:32,889
you have this really interesting thing called
content. Content is a name of the insertion

316
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,519
point; it's the HTML element which represents
the insertion point. And then you see it has

317
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,059
a select attribute in a value that looks very
similar to something. What does it look like?

318
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,330
People from the audience?
Is that &mdash;

319
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,450
>>Alex Komoroske: CSS?
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right, so that's what you

320
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:02,450
use. You use CSS selectors to say which items
will show through in my insertion point? And

321
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:11,860
so what we say here is the H3, first of
type, which is the first H3 we find as child,

322
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,649
is going to show up right here instead of
this thing when rendering, and then we have

323
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:21,119
a little aside item for our tool tip, and
then we say, eh, everything else, universal

324
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,200
selector goes inside there.
>>Alex Komoroske: So what we're doing basically

325
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,100
is we're using CSS to decide which elements
to sort of funnel and tele-port where when

326
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,169
we render.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: That's right.

327
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:35,690
>>Alex Komoroske: Okay. So what we're actually
kind of doing here too is we're almost defining

328
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:42,690
a declarative API. We say if you provide some
H3s, the first ones, what we'll use as the

329
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:48,309
actual name for the thing and later ones we'll
just establish another &mdash;

330
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,730
>>Dimitri Glazkov: So you have this not only
mechanism to stash things away into the subtree,

331
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,419
you also have a mechanism to now declaratively
project some of the items. You don't have

332
00:32:55,419 --> 00:33:02,419
to write a bit of script to do this. This
is all built in. This is standard stuff. Awesome?

333
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,919
Awesome. All right. Okay.
And so the next thing is we need to take these

334
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:17,419
Shadow DOM subtrees and build them into something
useful, and that's where custom elements come

335
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:21,730
in. Custom elements allow you to define a
new element, and for that purpose we have

336
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,580
the new HTML element &mdash; that's a good name
for it &mdash; which allows you to specify and

337
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,619
say, well, there's my element, <x-choice>,
and inside of it, the template. Remember the

338
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:31,499
template? That's where my Shadow DOM subtree
instance is. Every time I create a new <x-choice>,

339
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:33,539
that will be stamped out and create a new
instance of the Shadow DOM subtree. And then

340
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:37,740
you can run script inside of it to do lots
of cool things. For example, you can declare

341
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,090
an imperative API, and say, well, the <x-choice>
method needs extra methods &mdash; or <x-choice>

342
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,350
object needs extra methods or properties on
it, and you can do this. And also you can

343
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:50,470
define things like life cycle hooks, like
I want to run some scripts, register events

344
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:54,690
every time a new instance is created, right?
That's useful stuff.

345
00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:01,690
>>Alex Komoroske: So that's how you define
it as a component author. For component users

346
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:10,070
all you have to do, you include this link
to the components and point to the document

347
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:20,080
where this thing is defined, and then you
can just use it like any other built-in tag

348
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:35,970
in your page. And also, so you talked about
those imperative APIs we defined here, was

349
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:43,630
selected on this thing. If I go through and
grab this element out of the DOM using various

350
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,429
lectures, say, I can just call that method
directly on that object, the DOM object. The

351
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,710
DOM object is the object.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right. And there's no faking

352
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,270
there, right? There's no need to create separate
objects or view or things, your DOM objects

353
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,470
are the actual things that you operate on.
When you query the standard DOM APIs, use

354
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:12,760
them, whatever comes back to you is going
to be those things that you define.

355
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,190
>>Alex Komoroske: You don't have to know the
convention of the framework, how we stash

356
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:24,190
things and how DOM are related.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: And also the link rail,

357
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:33,390
the new rail components, gives you the opportunity
to create the packaging mechanism to build

358
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:40,390
packaging right into the browser. You don't
have to have a build script that then compiles

359
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:47,730
all this thing into one gob of code. You don't
have to have five script tags loaded into

360
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:54,570
your page. One link rail, you can load other
link rails if you want, you will have more

361
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:01,570
components that you want to reuse, and that's
all it takes. So it's packaging. It's reuse.

362
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:10,030
And also the ability to have one DOM hierarchy
instead of multiple tree objects.

363
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:17,030
>>Alex Komoroske: So one of the problems we
have today on the Web platform is styles sort

364
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,640
of naturally go all over the place. And so
when you're designing a style for your component,

365
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,700
it might go and mess up somebody else inadvertently.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: That is a very common problem,

366
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:35,950
especially if your object tree is pretty complex.
At some point you really start losing sight

367
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:42,950
of where &mdash; which selector, and you know,
how many of you guys have committed the Cardinal

368
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:53,080
sin of pound important? Okay. Be honest here
now. And so in Shadow DOM, there is some really

369
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,490
cool stuff here. In Shadow DOM the styles
are implicitly or explicitly scoped inside

370
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:05,490
of the Shadow DOM subtree. So even if you
put a universal selector inside of the Shadow

371
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,200
DOM subtree, it will only apply instead of
inside of the Shadow DOM subtree. So it will

372
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,960
not go and bleed out into a document. Similarly,
styles that you apply in the document will

373
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,410
not bleed into your Shadow DOM subtree. So
you have a very nice style separation boundary

374
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,560
which really works extremely well for widget
case scenarios where you want to have the

375
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,330
boundaries defined and you don't want people
to stomp on your styles, and you want to keep

376
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:40,330
some sort of sanity inside of your application.
>>Alex Komoroske: Okay. So that is sort of

377
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,440
behind the scenes. Thank you for that, Dimitri.
I actually just got a call from a designer,

378
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:52,440
he's watching on the live stream, and he says
that we shouldn't have used accordion, we

379
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,280
should have used a tab strip in our demo.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: I actually agree with the

380
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:08,910
designer, accordions are kind of weird anyway,
right, a cross between a piano and a harmonica,

381
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:15,910
really? Oh, you're talking about a widget.
I'm sorry. Okay, yes. So that is actually

382
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,680
really easy,
because we're using just markup, we're just

383
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,630
swapping tags, so the idea of swapping out
components now becomes just changing your

384
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,690
markup, right? So now we have to just include
in your component and then change X accordion

385
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:31,830
to be X tabs, and it's, you know, it's &mdash; we'll
just see what happens, right?

386
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:36,950
>>Alex Komoroske: Okay. So you say I have
to include the new component, which I actually

387
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,650
already did when you were talking, and I needed
to change X-accordion to X-tabs, is that right?

388
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,260
Save that, switch back to the demo and just
refresh.

389
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,450
>>Dimitri Glazkov: And now we have tabs. Applause,
please. [ APPLAUSE ]

390
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:51,870
>>Dimitri Glazkov: No wing suit drop, no wing
suits, but at least, you know, some cool tricks,

391
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,750
right, at some point. All right. So this looks
really, really awesome and I'm already kind

392
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:02,750
of enamored with this. I don't know about
you guys. But I really want this poll on my

393
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,860
website now.
>>Alex Komoroske: On your site.

394
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:15,860
>>Dimitri Glazkov: On my site.
>>Alex Komoroske: just so guys know, I'll

395
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,920
show you what Dimitri's website looks like.
It's beautiful. It's really special. It's

396
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:27,920
awesome. So, no offense, Dimitri. I definitely
hear that you want to have this poll on your

397
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:37,990
site. I'm a little bit concerned that you
might mark with it a bit, but that's okay.

398
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,600
I'm going to package this up for you so that
you can include it on your site without you

399
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,960
worrying about how you're going to set this
up. First of all, I don't want you to be able

400
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,070
to change the text for the choices, that way
you could stack the deck.

401
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:58,920
>>Dimitri Glazkov: I could add my own choices,
right? CSS 3. Why not CSS 4 or 7?

402
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,050
>>Alex Komoroske: So what I'm going to do
actually is I'm going to create a new element

403
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,720
called awesome poll, obviously.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Has to be awesome, awesome

404
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,770
site, right.
>>Alex Komoroske: And then to hide it from

405
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:17,210
people who are vetting it, I'm going to take
and put in my Shadow DOM one of those polls

406
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,420
so you can't see it.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Okay.

407
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:26,180
>>Alex Komoroske: Then what I'll do is I'll
allow yourself to define sort of where this

408
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:32,950
configuration is, and I'll then create all
the stuff inside the X poll in my own little

409
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,400
area.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Have you guys seen inception?

410
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,690
And if you haven't, please leave the room
now. It's like we have to go one level deeper,

411
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,020
right? Shadow DOM inside of the Shadow DOM.
You know, seriously cool stuff.

412
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,860
>>Alex Komoroske: Okay. So what we'll do,
so then you can just put that right in your

413
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,100
page and you will have the poll right there.
Awesome.

414
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,680
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Wow, this is &mdash; well...
>>Alex Komoroske: What?

415
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:56,720
>>Dimitri Glazkov: It kind of looks not like
my site actually. The place my vote clearly

416
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,640
doesn't have enough exclamation points. I
don't know. I kind of want to customize it

417
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,770
a little.
>>Alex Komoroske: Okay. Okay. So you're right.

418
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:06,430
This is actually technically just as good
as an iframe basically. Doesn't give you any

419
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,830
way to customize it. So you have such an interesting
vocabulary and way of speaking.

420
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,500
>>Dimitri Glazkov: I do. I'm a very colorful
person.

421
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,000
>>Alex Komoroske: I don't want you to have
control over everything, but I guess &mdash; I

422
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,660
guess subtitle and the button will allow you
to override. So I'm going to define in my

423
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:29,970
poll, I'm going to allow you to have a declarative
API, allow you to define your own aside for

424
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,960
that subtitle and your own label text.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: That sounds good.

425
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,190
>>Alex Komoroske: What we'll do is we'll switch
back to your site. Right here. I already wrote

426
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:43,320
in here where you had this customization,
save that, switch back to my demo, refresh,

427
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,360
and vote for CSS 3 because it's awesome, and
vote now.

428
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,390
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Now I have plenty of exclamation
points, right, guys?

429
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,510
Think about what just happened. Just stop
for a second. I have customized a poll without

430
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,480
mucking it up, because Alex is a developer
of this custom component, of this web component,

431
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,670
the awesome poll, only gave me the guardrails
to step into this specific areas, and that's

432
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:03,670
all. And the way I do this is by markup. I
don't have to go GS and do some weird muckety

433
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:11,810
muckety JSON stuff. Well, you know, the font
kind of looks like a clean and creepy. I want

434
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,090
something huggable and wonderful. What could
be more wonderful than comic SANS? It's from

435
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:23,050
the perfection, right? So what we're going
to do &mdash; I want to say

436
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:28,599
that I'm not going to do this unless you let
me customize the font.

437
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:34,330
>>> I admire design aesthetic, I think it's
very unique, but I don't want you to be able

438
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:40,810
to run all over this stuff and break everything,
so I guess what I'm going to allow you to

439
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,600
do is change a couple of things in here, before
I do that, I'm want to walk you through how

440
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,070
I'm going to do this. So CSS variables is
one new technology, the spec is nearing completion.

441
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,600
We actually have it implemented in Chrome
behind the flag. CSS variables &mdash;

442
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,920
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Wait, wait, wait, did you
just say CSS variables? Guys, are you getting

443
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,830
this? Are you getting the CSS variables?
>>Alex Komoroske: Yeah, it's kind of cool,

444
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,770
right, because today you have to have, define
pound FFF, one, two, three, four, like 8,000

445
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:05,030
places in you're CSS. This allows you basically
to define it once. So they're actually really,

446
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,420
really powerful. You can do all kinds of cool
stuff with cascade and referencing other variables.

447
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,660
We don't need that today. I really encourage
you guys to look more into CSS variables and

448
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,090
all the crazy, amazing stuff it can do, but
the cool thing about CSS variables is it allows

449
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,810
a very natural place for me to allow you to
override what I want. So when I'm writing

450
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,850
my poll, I'll use CSS variables very deliberately
in places that I want you to be able to hook

451
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,840
in and change my stuff.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: So these are my styling

452
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:33,810
hooks. I can't go anywhere and mess with anything
else.

453
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,770
>>Alex Komoroske: I'm only giving you &mdash; allowing
you to change a few things. So in this case

454
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:44,770
I'll allow you to change maybe the font and
also the color that we use as the primary

455
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,010
color.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Colors are important.

456
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,760
>>Alex Komoroske: What you'll do on your sheet
is you'll just style &mdash; direct some styles,

457
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,600
these variables at my poll, and then it will
magically just work.

458
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,740
>>Dimitri Glazkov: I want to see this.
>>Alex Komoroske: I'm going to switch to CSS,

459
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,240
and I'm going to uncomment &mdash; I've already
written &mdash;

460
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,600
>>Dimitri Glazkov: You made the right choice.
>>Alex Komoroske: Comic sans, I thought you

461
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,020
would like that. I'm going to switch back
to my &mdash; to your site. Refresh. There you

462
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,040
go &mdash;
>>Dimitri Glazkov: This is now awesome. I

463
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,860
can do this. [ APPLAUSE ]
But again take a second to think about this.

464
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,780
Now you as the developer of the widget or
a component can give specific instructions

465
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,490
to the browser on what to permit the user
of the component to do. Isn't that awesome?

466
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:18,740
Isn't that styling APIs?
Who wants this? Who wants this? [ Applause

467
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:18,920
]
>>Alex Komoroske: I want this.

468
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:19,450
>>Dimitri Glazkov: All right!
>>Alex Komoroske: Cool. So we've walked you

469
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:26,450
through a couple of examples of how to use
this stuff and also some of the tactical uses

470
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,190
you can have with this.
And actually is a bigger deal than just that.

471
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:37,110
The way that I think of that actually &mdash; I'm
actually a little bit dramatic, I guess sometimes,

472
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:44,110
is the declarative Renaissance. So way long
time go, you just used HTML, you just wrote

473
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,800
(indiscernible) code straightforward, and
then we started using JavaScript a lot for

474
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:09,210
a lot of stuff, right? But now this allows
people to return back to writing things very

475
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,020
declaratively in most cases. There's a lot
of stuff that allows that to happen.

476
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:17,700
>>> And like one of the most important things
that I think is &mdash; the ability to actually

477
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,780
talk via an API. Or tell the browser, specify
to &mdash; to let the user know: These are the

478
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,970
things that you can do and no more. And no
matter how much you hack about on this or

479
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:27,680
do whatever this &mdash; whatever, you can't mess
up my stuff. My stuff is safe. I gave you

480
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,160
these hooks, that's all that you can do. You
have CSS variables for the styling API and

481
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,430
you have the components, the Shadow DOM technology,
to allow you to have the markup API. And then

482
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,590
you, of course, can define &mdash; define the imperative
API on custom elements. So the Web components

483
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,270
give you those three things. To essentially
explicitly define APIs on the components now.

484
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,520
Awesome stuff.
>>Alex Komoroske: So another one that's really

485
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:41,620
cool is we talked about before, if DOM is
your composition mechanism, then components

486
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,590
from different libraries just work together.
This is neat, I'm like oh, cool, you can get

487
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,310
whatever widget you want. But it also means
that today we have to spend all of this time

488
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,640
recreating tabstrips and calendar controls
and everything in each and every framework.

489
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,720
And, of course, each time you do it, you probably
aren't going to get 100% perfect, but 80%

490
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,410
of the way there. But if everyone can use
any calendar component, then people will start

491
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:02,410
using the better one, it will be more of an
incentive to build really, really awesome,

492
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:14,390
accessible, beautiful, interactive components.
You will see a lot better components as well.

493
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,230
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right. No longer you have
to pledge allegiance to a specific framework.

494
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,420
That little mini browser that was built inside
of your browser, you can say well, no longer

495
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,370
I am just specifically a backbone man. I can
just use markup and mix them around, because

496
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,070
this is just markup. It's a common media.
Just standard stuff is in the DOM, in your

497
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:18,410
browser.
If you look at this, you can clearly see another

498
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,390
advantage. For a &mdash; for a company or a team
of people working on the same Web applications,

499
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,840
ability to encapsulate offers tremendous advantages,
right? Because now you can work on this stuff

500
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,090
without worrying about stepping on each other's
toes, you can have a clean separation, you

501
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,090
can build work flows that actually make sense
and not have this crazy schemes of discipline

502
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,090
built into this. Making that sure your selectors
have to start with #foo and all of that thing

503
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,090
that you have to do today when you build complex
applications.

504
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:21,200
>>Alex Komoroske: Cool. So the other case
is that again most cases are fully declarative.

505
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:21,430
So these people who don't know script, they
don't have a CS degree, they can still be

506
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,530
really productive. They can build really cool
stuff with these components.

507
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,070
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right. And one of the other
things here is because the browser is taking

508
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:25,330
care of loading and understanding the packaging
obligations, the rendering of the things,

509
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:25,580
it can go much faster because the browser
ultimately kind of knows more about rendering

510
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:25,580
than any author or any JavaScript engineer
could do because we have a little more hooks

511
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:25,580
than standard JavaScript application could.
>>Alex Komoroske: The final one, and this

512
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:25,580
one is kind of crazy, so bear with me, is
the rise of shared semantics. So today your

513
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:25,650
semantics might only apply within your site
because there's no good way to share them.

514
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,200
But if you allow people to define these tags
that are useful to Web developers, it's very

515
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,390
obvious if we are &mdash; for example, we will
see these x-polls, it's very obvious that

516
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:38,390
people find that useful. And so this is a
great way for Web developers to experiment

517
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,700
with new components and things. After a while,
maybe you will see that everyone is using

518
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,560
tabstrips, they are using it in the same basic
way, well, we just roll that into the spec,

519
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:49,940
roll that into the standard.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Directly into HTML.

520
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,540
>>Alex Komoroske: Directly into the browser.
Why do you have to define your own? This is

521
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,140
a great place for Web developers to experiment,
show us the way as browser developers, about

522
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:51,610
what stuff we should be directly baking in.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Right. And if you look

523
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:55,000
at it from another slightly different perspective,
is that today there is no path from local

524
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,000
semantics, the semantics of your framework,
to the global semantics, the public semantics

525
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,230
of HTML. Once you've built that thing imperatively,
there is no existence of the actual tags,

526
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:13,010
there is no path to the tags. You can just
study those things, and look at the patterns

527
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:17,770
and wonder what is the right thing. But there
is no path. With the custom tags, you actually

528
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,720
start having this path because these are just
tags. And now all that you have to do is run

529
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,490
a really,
really large query, which Google can do actually,

530
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:22,330
and figure out which elements are common.
Then you can know precisely which tags are

531
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,630
winning, which tags deserve to become more
public and at some point make it into the

532
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:23,880
&mdash; into the HTML spec, for example.
>>Alex Komoroske: It's really cool stuff.

533
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:23,910
Again, Dimitri and I come from the future,
so that's why we can talk about all of this

534
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,090
amazing stuff. The good news is actually that
the future isn't quite as far away as you

535
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,170
might think. We aren't from, like, years in
the future; we're from, like, a few months

536
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,250
in the future, basically.
So shadow DOM and CSS variables are both implemented

537
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:24,310
in Chrome today. They are behind the 5. They
aren't released on the Web yet, but if you

538
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:24,400
really want to you can go on and play with
them. There are lots of effective polyfills.

539
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:24,540
Polyfills are basically shims that allow you
to use functionality before it's directly

540
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:24,790
in the browser. We'll talk about those in
a second. And another thing is this is not

541
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:24,840
a Chrome thing. This is being done in standards,
we have a lot of other browser vendors are

542
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:24,950
extremely excited about the number of folks
from those are in the audience today. We are

543
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:24,980
really working, this is a collaborative effort,
a concerted effort with everybody to build

544
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,000
this. So this is something that you can actually
look forward to using relatively soon.

545
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,030
>>Dimitri Glazkov: It's happening, guys, it's
coming, seriously.

546
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:25,230
>>Alex Komoroske: So what can you guys do
that you are all jazzed up about this stuff?

547
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:25,890
Well, you can help the future arrive faster.
The one way &mdash; there's lots of links and information

548
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:26,220
on this slide. What you should do right now
if you are already a member of the Web components

549
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:26,540
plus page is follow us. We have a Google short
link right there for you. This is where we

550
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:26,790
post interested updates about the spec, the
implementations, cool examples, blog posts.

551
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,190
It's the one place that you can really learn
about all of this stuff going on. And right

552
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:27,440
after this we're going to post all of these
links to that plus page. If you want to, you

553
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:27,590
can read the introduction
to Web components. You probably learn that

554
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:27,730
specs are really hard to read and they often
are, but actually Dimitri has done an amazing

555
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:27,820
job writing an explainer, that goes through
all of these concepts, in quiet some depth

556
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:27,890
but in a very readable way.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: I promise there's no comic

557
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,950
sans on that page. If you are scared.
>>Alex Komoroske: You can also read the CSS

558
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,030
variable spec, understand more how that stuff
works, all of the amazing stuff that you can

559
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,110
do with it. It's really more powerful than
it looks.

560
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:28,160
>>Dimitri Glazkov: The other thing is that
there is actually a lot of really cool discussions

561
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,240
happening right now in your present about
the Web components and working out all of

562
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:28,430
the corner cases, working out the kinks of
how things should work precisely. I mean we're

563
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,490
in the future, all of those things are solved,
we don't have to worry about them, but you

564
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:28,560
guys have to worry about it. Because getting
this stuff done just right and making sure

565
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:28,610
this does not suck is really, really important.
So, please, if you have any, you know, gumption

566
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:28,680
for bike shedding, or really, really endless
discussions with no end, please join the standards

567
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:28,730
list and start listening in, start understanding
what's going on, what's happening.

568
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:28,780
>>Alex Komoroske: It's also possible to start
building with this stuff today. Dimitri has

569
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:28,830
written a polyfill for Web components, all
it requires is Shadow DOM, so you would have

570
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:29,340
to turn it on in Chrome to play around with
it. That's a really cool thing that actually

571
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:29,780
makes the polyfill for this entire thing,
everything that we have shown you today is

572
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,090
how we actually did &mdash;
>>Dimitri Glazkov: You know those self driving

573
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:30,550
cars? It's like that. It's like a very, very
early prototype that you can possibly drive.

574
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:30,990
Bad things may happen, I can't guarantee &mdash;
>>Alex Komoroske: Don't use that one for anything

575
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:31,420
in production today are written by Daniel
Buchner, who I believe is right there from

576
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:31,820
Mozilla, he's built this really cool library
called x-tags. X-tags is basically a polyfill

577
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,340
for the custom elements part of what we showed
you today. The cool thing about that is this

578
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:32,590
actually
works in all major browsers. It uses a number

579
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,240
of very clever hacks to do it, but you actually
can start building real apps on top of this

580
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:33,490
today if you want.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Daniel is actually actively

581
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:33,640
at work building a pretty, pretty solid toolkit
on top of this, the UI widget library that

582
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:33,890
would potentially power some really, really
cool applications in the future.

583
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,060
>>Alex Komoroske: That's really cool, so check
that out once we post the link to that plus

584
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,330
page.
All right, great! So that's all that we have

585
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,010
for you today, we wanted to share a little
bit more about Web components, it's a really

586
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:36,510
exciting thing for the future. Thanks so much
for coming out. [ Applause ]

587
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,140
>>Dimitri Glazkov: And &mdash; and in the future
&mdash; the future bus leaves in 10 minutes, but

588
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:37,600
until then we can answer your questions if
you would like.

589
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:37,970
>>Alex Komoroske: Come up to one of these
microphones that we've got here in the aisles.

590
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:38,220
>>> What about events?
>>Alex Komoroske: What about events is the

591
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,230
question we got from the audience.
>>Dimitri Glazkov: The events are actually

592
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,250
also handled by the Shadow DOM specifications,
and there's really neat things that we do

593
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:38,260
to make sure that the information in the event
never escapes outside of the Shadow DOM subtree,

594
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:38,280
but the events are heard. It's called retargeting.
What happens is that if something fires, like,

595
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,290
for example, if you click a play button in
your video element, the event or the click

596
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:38,310
event propagates out, but it looks like it
came from the video element. Does that make

597
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:38,320
sense? So it's actually a really complex part
of those things, and we fought extremely hard

598
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:38,340
to make sure that Shadow DOM feels transparent
to the user and it doesn't look like it's

599
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:38,360
affecting any actual normal operation of the
events. But the information from the inside

600
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:38,370
of the Shadow DOM subtree never leaks out
on the outside.

601
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:38,380
>>Alex Komoroske: We've got a question at
this mic.

602
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:38,390
>>> So it sounds like a lot of this is helping
you with bringing in dependencies and encapsulating

603
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,410
code. Have you guys thought much in the spec
about dependency management, you know, I mean,

604
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:38,420
obviously a lot of Java developers and a lot
of developers in general use Maven for that,

605
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:38,440
so you don't get dependency explosion with
inside your app. There's that encapsulated

606
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:38,450
part but, you know, in a team you want to
try and use consistent dependencies across.

607
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:38,470
Has that been addressed in the spec at all?
>>Dimitri Glazkov: At this point there is

608
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:38,480
just early discussions on how this actual
linking of the custom elements, the packaging,

609
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:38,500
will happen, so this is actually a good time
to start talking and start discussing this

610
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:38,510
type of thing. I mean you saw that in the
future and you saw it works but, you know,

611
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:38,530
later on.
>>> What about like with media queries where

612
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:38,540
the widget, the component need to adapt based
on certain break points, and usually those

613
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:38,550
break points are going to be different based
on whatever context of the app they are used

614
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:38,570
in. Right. So one of the interesting things
there is that first of all we made sure that

615
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:38,590
Shadow DOM actually operates within the confines
of CSS, we are not inventing anything abnormal,

616
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:38,600
so all of the CSS machinery the way that you
operate on it will just work. It just feels,

617
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:38,620
it has the same &mdash; it will feel like it's
just part of the documents. So you will get

618
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,640
all of the same information about the size
and media queries, things like that.

619
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:38,650
>>> (Inaudible).
>>> I'm an extension developer in the users

620
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:38,660
group aficionado, and there's lots of templated
sites out there that don't use that yet, but

621
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:38,680
that would be great to extend. And are you
thinking about how to integrate this into

622
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:38,690
the Chrome extension API so that we can add
components where there are none and change

623
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:38,710
them?
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Shadow DOM is actually

624
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:38,710
one of the really, really use cases for extensions,
the ones that modify the page on the fly.

625
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,730
Because what you can do is you can build a
Shadow DOM into an element and the document

626
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:38,750
doesn't know that it's there. And so yes,
it's a very common use case, yes, it's coming.

627
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:38,770
>>> Thank you.
>>> I'm a (indiscernible) developer but I

628
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:38,770
was thinking could you invent the map API
into the Shadow DOM so it would build a custom

629
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:38,790
tech for example a store locator and give
that to a customer and say, hey, do this and

630
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:38,810
 &mdash;
>>Alex Komoroske: That's a phenomenal use

631
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:38,810
case, doing exactly that. In fact, one of
the components of x-tag &mdash;

632
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:38,830
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Talk to this guy, he's
already got one.

633
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:38,840
>>Alex Komoroske: That's an awesome use case
for it. Yeah.

634
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:38,850
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Come on, bring it on!
>>Alex Komoroske: Anything else?

635
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:38,860
>>> What about the SCO, like there's potential
information like the SI tag that would be

636
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:38,870
less important, would Google bot pick that
up because it's not potentially rendered on

637
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:38,890
the page?
>>> We don't work on the search team so we

638
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:38,900
don't know the answer to that question. We
can imagine there's going to be interesting

639
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:38,910
changes in the way that people &mdash;
>>Dimitri Glazkov: It doesn't have to be on

640
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:38,920
the SI tag, it can be on H1 or poll, if you
want it to. It's up to you to define it as

641
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:38,950
the author of the API.
>>Alex Komoroske: If there are any other questions,

642
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,960
Dimitri and I will be hanging around for few
minutes afterwards if you want to ask us any

643
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:38,980
other questions. Thanks so much. [ Applause

644
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:38,980
>>Dimitri Glazkov: Yay!
