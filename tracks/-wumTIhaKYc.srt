00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,920
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,000
interesting developer community.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,840
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,920
has asked this question.

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,670
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,728
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

8
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,354
answer show.

9
00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:44,560
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:53,360

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,300
PETE LEPAGE: Well,
welcome everyone.

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,240
My name is Pete LePage.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,630
I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

14
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,030
And with me today, we have Paul
Kinlan, who is here in

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,860
London joining us.

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,290
PAUL KINLAN: Hello.

17
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,710
PETE LEPAGE: And we're here to
talk about Chrome apps and

18
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,400
talk about the networking
stack.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,010
We decided to do something a
little bit different, a little

20
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,320
bit fun this week.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,000
This was actually Paul's idea
to go a little bit deep and

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,610
see if we could get a little bit
meta, do something inside

23
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,170
of something that normally
hasn't been done before.

24
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,680
So Paul, why don't you introduce
us to some of the

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,770
new networking APIs that
are available?

26
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,480
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, cool,
so I'm Paul Kinlan.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,640
I'm based in London.

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,490
You know Pete, you know
what we forgot to do?

29
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,110
PETE LEPAGE: What is that?

30
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,480
PAUL KINLAN: We forgot to look
at each other and high-five

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,190
each other across
the internet.

32
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,020
PETE LEPAGE: So we're ready.

33
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,580
All right.

34
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,320
PAUL KINLAN: Are
you good to go?

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,900
PETE LEPAGE: We're good to go.

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,400
You ready?

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,340
PAUL KINLAN: Three, two, one.

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,610
PETE LEPAGE: Two, three.

39
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,390
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

40
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:46,950
PETE LEPAGE: Whoa.

41
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,960
OK, well, that was a complete,
total, utter fail.

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,190
But that's OK.

43
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,650
PAUL KINLAN: It sounded good.

44
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,940
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah,
it sounded good.

45
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,540
And we tried.

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,270
PAUL KINLAN: We tried, right.

47
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,550
PETE LEPAGE: A for effort.

48
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,190
PAUL KINLAN: So yes, anyway,
back on the subject.

49
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,920
We have a new set of
APIs in Chrome.

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,670
I think in the past that we've
talked about the Chrome socket

51
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,100
API and space.

52
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,770
And one big glaring omission
from that API was the ability

53
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,600
to listen on port and
bind to it by UDP.

54
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,850
That landed a little
while ago.

55
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,360
So you can build a server,
which basically

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,470
receives UDP input.

57
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,350
And when we showed you the Air
Drone demo, about three or

58
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,150
four weeks ago I think, that was
using a UDP-based server.

59
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,390
But again, the next omission,
from this whole API, was the

60
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,430
ability to, actually in
JavaScript and HTML, build a

61
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,900
server that is TCP based
inside the browser.

62
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,250
So we now have the ability.

63
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,280
And it landed recently.

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,500
It's only experimental.

65
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,810
It's only in Chrome Canary
at the moment.

66
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:49,780
But we recently landed the
ability to listen and accept

67
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,880
API calls inside Chrome.

68
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,580
So what this enables you
to do is basically

69
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,410
build TCP based servers.

70
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,810
You could build an FTP server.

71
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,090
What we're going to talk about
today, which is a web server

72
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,720
that we've built and will
be available in

73
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,010
GitHub after the show.

74
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,460
Yeah, it's pretty powerful.

75
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,680
The fact that you can have a
web server inside your web

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,380
browser itself, inside
your applications.

77
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,030
I think it's been
done by Opera.

78
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,310
And I think Firefox has
had some stuff.

79
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,366
But now we've got pure access in
JavaScript to be able to do

80
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:16,710
these things.

81
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,680
And it's pretty exciting
inside apps.

82
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,780
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah,
it definitely is.

83
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,960
And this is one of these things
that I don't think

84
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,010
really anybody's ever
done before.

85
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,690
And accessing these things is a
really powerful thing to be

86
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,540
able to do.

87
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,170
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

88
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,670
I'ts pretty cool, right?

89
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,890
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

90
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,660
PAUL KINLAN: So we were
discussing the different types

91
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,000
of ideas, the things
that we could do.

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,340
And you know, web server
is the first one.

93
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,860
The first thing that most people
try and do is a web

94
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,700
server inside whatever it is,
listen on port 80 or even get

95
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,700
the GET requests
coming back in.

96
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,990
But you could go even further.

97
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,500
You could build an
SMTP server.

98
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,895
And the really important thing
about these type of

99
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:52,620
the things is that &mdash;

100
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,560
I missed saying this before,
and should have said it

101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,470
earlier on &mdash;

102
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,220
I think, personally, this
is really important

103
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,140
for Chrome OS, right?

104
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,550
We want the people and the
developers to be able to use

105
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,090
Chrome OS as a platform to
be able to develop web

106
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,680
applications and applications
in general.

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,800
And I think one of the things
that has generally been

108
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,190
missing is this ability to, when
you're offline, connect

109
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,745
to a local instance of a web
server, build your application

110
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:15,920
locally, your website locally,
connect to it, and test it

111
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,000
inside the browser.

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,029
And I think this API, this
single API, the listen and

113
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,060
accept APIs in the socket
interface, they allow us to do

114
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,390
those types of things.

115
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,920
It's going to be pretty cool
in the future to see what

116
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,995
comes out on this.

117
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:30,145
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

118
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,370
Go ahead.

119
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,040
PAUL KINLAN: Should we jump to
a demo, just to prove it does

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,170
work, and I'm not lying and
bringing everyone on?

121
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,800
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, I
think we should.

122
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,080
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,860
PETE LEPAGE: All right, so
we've got your screen up.

124
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,510
People can see your screen.

125
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,200
PAUL KINLAN: Yay.

126
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,650
This is my app.

127
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,630
It's like a semi standalone
application build with the

128
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,530
Chrome app APIs.

129
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,740
And what it allows us to do &mdash;
and I'll just reload it,

130
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,840
because I was testing
it before.

131
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,800
Never say I never
come prepared.

132
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,160
I was testing it before.

133
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,510
So pick a file.

134
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,170
And it's this directory here,
this app directory that I want

135
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,650
to serve from my local machine,
to obviously local

136
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,660
connections.

137
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,430
Press Select, Start.

138
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,540
So the interesting thing
about this, and I

139
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,770
think I kind of like &mdash;

140
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,680
oh, there's a big list of files
it can actually serve.

141
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,910
I've used the normal input type
equals file attribute &mdash;

142
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,350
method, sorry.

143
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,880
Is it method?

144
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,390
PETE LEPAGE: The directory?

145
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,310
PAUL KINLAN: HTML tag.

146
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,370
Yeah, the HTML5 tag, input type
equals file, with WebKit

147
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,030
Directory, so I can select
directories.

148
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,945
That returns, obviously, an
on-change It gives us access

149
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,810
to the list of files that
we've selected.

150
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,650
And I basically just take a
reference to those file

151
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,260
references.

152
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,000
And then I'll serve them
in the web or locally.

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,300
So 127, there we go.

154
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,170
That's it.

155
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,560
It's kind of simple, Wotcha!

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:52,970
Now live.

157
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,530
This is an application
I made with Yeoman

158
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,390
in about two seconds.

159
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,860
PETE LEPAGE: Whoohoo.

160
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,100
PAUL KINLAN: Nice little
plug to Yeoman.

161
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,140
But it's the basic application,
right?

162
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,020
It's not styled up.

163
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,190
But the interesting thing is if
we go to Inspect Element &mdash;

164
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,780
let me just detach that so we
can see it inside the screen.

165
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,530
PETE LEPAGE: And just to mention
this, for folks who

166
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,620
are interested, if they want
to check out the code for

167
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,990
this, they can go to the
URL on the screen.

168
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,150
You can go download the sample
at goo.gl/AZSTg.

169
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,030
And you can see that
capitalization and all that

170
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,500
stuff there.

171
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,750
But, all right, sorry.

172
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,530
Go ahead, Paul.

173
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,270
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah,
that's cool.

174
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,700
So we just push stuff to GitHub,
so people can off and

175
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,915
experiment with it now.

176
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:32,880
The caveat is, it's still
experimental.

177
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,450
So you need to enable
experimental

178
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,090
APIs and about flags.

179
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,860
And it's also only available
in Canary.

180
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,640
But once you enable those
two things, you can

181
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,260
actually play this API.

182
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,030
And if you look here,
this is the code.

183
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,030
Sorry, not the code.

184
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,190
Sorry, this is the list of
requests, just to prove that

185
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm actually making
those requests

186
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,890
from my local resource &mdash;

187
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,010
script score slash vendor, for
instance, forward slash

188
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,820
modernizer dot min dot JS.

189
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,380
That's being served off
of my local file

190
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,810
system via this interface.

191
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,482
So it's pretty cool.

192
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:01,260
It's pretty powerful.

193
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,400
And we're going to show
you actually how

194
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,620
to build these things &mdash;

195
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:05,980
PETE LEPAGE: Sweet.

196
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,620
PAUL KINLAN: Today.

197
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,320
So should we jump into code?

198
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,850
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

199
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,300
PAUL KINLAN: So, as we can see
here, everybody who can see my

200
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,170
screen, the first thing that
we need to do when we're

201
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,820
building this application, is
actually change the manifest.

202
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,010
The reason why we need to do
this, and I should've gotten

203
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,690
rid of this earlier on, is by
default we don't normally have

204
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,500
experimental permissions enabled
inside our manifest.

205
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,410
So if I just select this and
see this here, you add

206
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,450
experimental.

207
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,810
This will enable your access
to the advanced socket API.

208
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,030
You then ask for a socket
permission.

209
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,660
And this is relatively
new syntax.

210
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,380
It landed maybe about
a month ago.

211
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,370
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

212
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,320
PAUL KINLAN: But it allows you
to basically say and list

213
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,480
different types of permissions
that you want the socket

214
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,490
interface to have inside
your application.

215
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,920
So if you're going to do UDP
server or send UDP requests

216
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,940
out from your client
applications or remote server,

217
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,010
you need to actually specify
this up front, so that the

218
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,110
user, when they install this
application, they know the

219
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,170
types of interactions with your
native operating system

220
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,430
that you're going to have.

221
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,560
And in this case &mdash;

222
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,020
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

223
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,110
I was going to say, Paul, so
if I want to send UDP, I'm

224
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,800
guessing it's probably not UDP
connect and UDP listen is it?

225
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,360
PAUL KINLAN: No it's not.

226
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,390
It's UDP sendto, I believe.

227
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,790
And it will be UDP bind.

228
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,790
PETE LEPAGE: UDP sendto to send
packets, and then UDP

229
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,110
bind will allow you to bind to
a port to listen for next

230
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,885
stuff coming in?

231
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:29,280
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

232
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,260
And the sytax can get a little
bit more complex.

233
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,080
So you can basically, in theory,
bind to just a single

234
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,539
address on a special port.

235
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,309
And what this is basically
trying to say to do here is,

236
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,180
well, if you say TCP listen,
your application could bind to

237
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,760
any port on the user's system.

238
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,975
I believe it's not under the
root's permissions, so

239
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:50,150
anything below.

240
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,400
1024, I think you can't
bind to, but anything

241
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,215
above that you can.

242
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:57,460
But when you're doing a UDP
send or a TCP connect, in

243
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,710
theory, you could connect
to port 22 for TELNET

244
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,110
and port 80 for HTTP.

245
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,650
You just want to let the user
know, for instance, those

246
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,790
types of services.

247
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,910
I'm going to give them that
little bit of extra trust that

248
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,880
they get when they know the
only things that they can

249
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,980
access are the things you've
listed up front.

250
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,690
But anyway, back on topic.

251
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,760
The most important thing
here is TCP listen.

252
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,280
This is the new experimental
permission that you need for

253
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,830
the socket interface to be able
to listen to ports and

254
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,110
listen to incoming requests.

255
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,950
So if you add this in and you've
already got a socket

256
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,060
based application, you
should be good to go.

257
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,900
Now that doesn't mean that &mdash;

258
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,730
sorry &mdash;

259
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,615
doesn't mean, straight away,
that you're going be able to

260
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:38,360
start taking requests.

261
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,660
Obviously you have to
program the API.

262
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,890
So I just want to show you, just
to prove that all this is

263
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,470
the same thing.

264
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,676
Ignore this styling stuff.

265
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:50,450
But let me go to the next
input type equals file.

266
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,350
This is the HTML that's
involved in actually

267
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,530
constructing our
user interface.

268
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,845
Input type equals file with an
attribute of WebKit Directory

269
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,160
and just an ID called
directory.

270
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,980
Now the reason why I do WebKit
Directory is, if you've never

271
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,070
actually done this before,
normally, input type equals

272
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,290
file only allows you to
select one file from

273
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,710
the user's file system.

274
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,350
If you do input type equals
file under a multiple

275
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,700
attribute, then you can select
multiple files on the user's

276
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,440
system and get it brought back
into your application.

277
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,450
But if you do WebKit Directory,
WebKit Directory

278
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,110
basically gives you the entire
list of files inside the

279
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,610
directory that the
user's selected.

280
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,280
So we went to the app demo
before, and we saw the fact

281
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,560
that I selected the app folder,
everything inside that

282
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,680
folder is now available
to my application

283
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,030
to be able to read.

284
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,140
You can't write to those
applications.

285
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,790
That's actually a subject for
another Hangout altogether is

286
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,180
how to write to these files
and actually you can get

287
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,230
access to them once you've
got a reference to it.

288
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,720
But now it's only read-only.

289
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,410
And to be fair, that's kind of
all we really need for our

290
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,360
basic web service &mdash;

291
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,680
to be able to read files that
are contained in a directory

292
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,580
that the user has chosen and
granted you access to.

293
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,970
So anyway, let's jump
into the code.

294
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,780
index.js is where it lives.

295
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,600
And as you can see, I've already
got a whole lot of

296
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:04,910
boilerplate.

297
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,550
I mean a lot of this code is
actually just hooking up the

298
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,070
user interface elements and
then also doing stream

299
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,650
conversions.

300
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,120
Because the interesting things
to know about the socket API

301
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,030
is it sends array
buffer objects.

302
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,200
And the array buffer object is
not something that we normally

303
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,290
deal with inside JavaScript.

304
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,490
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, we're not
used to that at all.

305
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,420
So what's the difference between
an array buffer and a

306
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,510
string, if I haven't really
played with those before?

307
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,673
PAUL KINLAN: Yes, so the main
difference between an array

308
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,030
buffer and a string,
essentially, is the fact that,

309
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,400
if you have ever done any kind
of boundary manipulation on

310
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,680
the string inside JavaScript,
you know how hard is it.

311
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,500
You have to take the high order
byte and the lower order

312
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,160
byte, because it's
UTF16, I think.

313
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
And you have to do a whole lot
of manipulation just to access

314
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,000
the core data.

315
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,070
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

316
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,070
PAUL KINLAN: And the array
buffer allows you to have

317
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,570
multiple different types of
views on a piece of data.

318
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,290
So you can say my entire data,
that's contained in array

319
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:04,430
buffer, is of UInt array type or
UInt8 array, UInt16 array,

320
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,460
UInt32 array.

321
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,470
So you can say your array is
of different types of data.

322
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,270
But, essentially, what it allows
you to do is say, well,

323
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,590
my view on this array buffer is
an array of 8 bit integers,

324
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,220
essentially.

325
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,140
And that allows you to then
say, well, we just read

326
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,170
through the bytes
individually.

327
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,530
So as you can see here, if we
go here, the view, we got a

328
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,880
new array based on the array
buffer of type UInt8 array.

329
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,940
And then we just iterate across
it and, basically,

330
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,300
convert our string.

331
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,870
So we convert our string
into UInt8 array.

332
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,270
So its written across our string
and then pushing that

333
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,330
value that's held in the array,
directly into the

334
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,320
actual array buffer itself.

335
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,040
PETE LEPAGE: Perfect.

336
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,210
PAUL KINLAN: And that's cool,
because then you can handle

337
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,340
big endian and little endian,
when you try and deliver data.

338
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,140
It's super important for the
socket API, because the

339
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,420
majority of time we're not
really sending strings around.

340
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,700
When doing a web socket, for
instance, you might want to

341
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,850
send a string, because
it's an adjacent

342
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,990
structure and that's fine.

343
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,100
But actually, at the raw level
for the socket API, you send

344
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,866
raw binary data.

345
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,020
And that's why we need these
extra little functions.

346
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,130
We also have an array buffer to
string, which we just used

347
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,500
to basically convert, obviously,
an array buffer,

348
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,000
the data that we receive back
from the service to a string.

349
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,710
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

350
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,410
PAUL KINLAN: And the reason
why we use this is that we

351
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,630
have to parse out, for instance,
when an HTTP request

352
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,685
comes in, there's a very
specific set of headers that

353
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:29,670
you get through.

354
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,590
And passing in binary, actually
byte by byte, is just

355
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,170
a bit of a pain.

356
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:34,400
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

357
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,080
PAUL KINLAN: So I convert
it to a string and do

358
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,680
some work onto it.

359
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,910
You'll see that there's
probably a big glaring

360
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,660
security hole in it, where I
just read the whole string.

361
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,640
And if you send a big enough
set of headers, like 1,000

362
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,140
megabytes or gigabytes of
headers, my application will

363
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,330
probably crash.

364
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,160
But just to demonstrate the
purpose of this, like I said

365
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,140
to you guys, we're ignoring
all of that type of stuff.

366
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,860
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

367
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,300
And I think that's one other
thing to point out.

368
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,030
We wrote this as a really quick
sample, not as something

369
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,220
that is meant to be used as a
key thing that you should copy

370
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,450
everything from and sit
down and write a web

371
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,750
server using this.

372
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,000
We just wanted to sort of get
some of the concepts across.

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,040
And there's a few things we
could have done better.

374
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,300
A few things we could
have done worse.

375
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,795
PAUL KINLAN: I mean the demo's
only going to show you how to

376
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:21,220
handle get requests.

377
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,860
So if you want to do cross
origin and post puts and

378
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,790
everything else, that's not
going to work at the moment.

379
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,300
But the concept is there.

380
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,740
You can build a web server
entirely in JavaScript that

381
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,230
lives inside your browser.

382
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,940
The place I always like this,
and I don't think they're ever

383
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,530
going to do it, but the App
Engine SDK uploader.

384
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,320
You kind of get your
dev environment.

385
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,520
You can basically run Python
with mscript and whatever

386
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,940
other technologies
you want to use.

387
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,580
You can have the App Engine's
mini system just run inside

388
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,286
the browser and upload.

389
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:56,190
That's where I'd like to get
to in 10 year's time.

390
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,555
Actually, in 10 year's time,
I'd like to be retired and

391
00:14:58,555 --> 00:14:59,180
living on the beach somewhere.

392
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,840
PETE LEPAGE: Well, yeah.

393
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,080
Well, how about then, in nine
years time, you get that done.

394
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,540
And then in 10 years, you can
retire, because everybody just

395
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,380
thinks that's so awesome and
they just make it happen.

396
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,450
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

397
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,026
I think that's good.

398
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:11,680
I think that's really good.

399
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,110
Should we do it?

400
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,500
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

401
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,360
Let's do it.

402
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,810
Done.

403
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,040
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

404
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,400
Done.

405
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,090
Let's ship it.

406
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,340
I have to say, I'm not
pre-announcing anything.

407
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,590

408
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,780
So anyway, on that subject.

409
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,710

410
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,760
So let's just jump through
the code, right.

411
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,210
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

412
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,230
PAUL KINLAN: This is before
the nitty-gritty, right.

413
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,490
I just want to show you the
rest of the infrastructure

414
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,770
that I've got ready
for you guys.

415
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,970
They are doing dot onchange.

416
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,600
It's not the nicest way
that we handle events.

417
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,150
But we're only going
to bind to it once.

418
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,760
And I just thought, for brevity,
it was going to be

419
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,440
easier for everyone
to understand.

420
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,400
When the user actually picks
a directory, we get

421
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,570
the onchange event.

422
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,610
In that onchange, we can get
an access to list of files

423
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,540
done by this little line of
code, line 58, e.target.files.

424
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,661
That's a list of files inside
the directory that the user

425
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:57,650
has chosen.

426
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,680
We just iterate across them.

427
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,320
We take the Web Kit relative
path, which gives us,

428
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,375
basically, a relative path.

429
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,710
It doesn't give us the full
directory structure, just the

430
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,020
root of where it is,
which is absolutely

431
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,005
fine for a web server.

432
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:11,600
Because we only ever deal,
really, with absolute paths

433
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,080
inside our own web app.

434
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,240
And then we just map that.

435
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,190
We take the path, map it into,
basically, a hash.

436
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,840
So that whenever a web request
comes in, I can then go and

437
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,130
easily pick the file up from my
in memory store and serve

438
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,660
that back out to the user.

439
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,680
So that's all there is from
actually getting access to the

440
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,290
file system.

441
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,320
It's not the full file system.

442
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,345
It's just the directory and all
the subdirectories that

443
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:34,600
the user has chosen.

444
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,610
But we can do some
nice things.

445
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,220
We can kind of serve them up
inside our application.

446
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,640
PETE LEPAGE: And to be clear,
this is the HTML5 file system,

447
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,730
or is this the file
system access that

448
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,150
comes with Chrome app?

449
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,470
PAUL KINLAN: No, no.

450
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,780
It's neither actually.

451
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,900
Eh.

452
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,520
So we have a couple different
types of file systems living

453
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,320
in the user's device,
basically.

454
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,420
We have the HTML5 file system,
which is entirely sandboxed

455
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,010
and only available to the
application, in that domain,

456
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,430
and all the files are obfuscated
and a whole lot of

457
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,990
other stuff so can't go and
easily parse the files out on

458
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,670
the user's local machine.

459
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,869
We also have &mdash;

460
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,559
what was the second
one you asked?

461
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,300
PETE LEPAGE: The Chrome
apps file system.

462
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,000
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, so we have
the Chrome apps file system.

463
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,550
I tell you what.

464
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,040
It's similar to the Chrome
apps file system API.

465
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,310
The Chrome apps file system API
and the media gallery API

466
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,440
essentially allow you to get
elevated access to those

467
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,280
directories.

468
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,690
So if you're using the file
system API, you can basically

469
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,760
say, well, the user's given
me a file, and I've got a

470
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,440
reference to that.

471
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,900
I want to write back to it.

472
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,540
And we don't need that in our
application, so we're not

473
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,790
using that part of the API.

474
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,325
But it's using the same file
object that you get back from

475
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,690
the system.

476
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,280
This is literally the user's
own file system itself.

477
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,680
So it's pretty cool.

478
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,210
It's just a file system, but
it's only the directory that

479
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,190
they've actually given
you access to.

480
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,160
So let's actually get into
the code, right.

481
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,120
Start the onclick.

482
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,060
This is the thing that's going
to start the server.

483
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,020
So it's pretty simple, right?

484
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,190
We've already got the
permissions ready.

485
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,670
So we're going to not call it
Isocket, because that's me

486
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,150
being silly with vim.

487
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,340
We're going to create a socket
of TCP type, with no extra

488
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,220
information supplied.

489
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,370
And then just take a function
call back, and call it

490
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,040
socketInfo.

491
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,110
So this is the very start of the
thing that most people do

492
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,740
when they're building a
socket-based interface or an

493
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,945
application, is they need
to create the socket.

494
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:22,260
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

495
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,420
PAUL KINLAN: So we need to do
a little bit more that that,

496
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,960
because that's not actually
doing anything.

497
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,600
For ease of use later on, I'm
going to bind the socket

498
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,710
information that we get
to a global variable.

499
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,590
Again, it's not the best type of
code, but it's just simple.

500
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,160
It works.

501
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,380
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

502
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,490
We're going to then operate our
socket to a server socket.

503
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,300
So we're going to say, listen.

504
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,180
And if we do listen &mdash;

505
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,040
oh god, sorry, I apologize.

506
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,290
socketInfo.socketID.

507
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,450

508
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,440
This is basically saying, for
the socket that we've just

509
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,270
created, we're going to turn
it into a server socket.

510
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,136
It doesn't mean much yet,
because we haven't got an

511
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:02,990
address to bind it to.

512
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:10,460
I'm just going to bind it to
local host on port 8081.

513
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,480
This is untested now.

514
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,963
So 8081, just to prove
that my demo later

515
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:15,366
on is going to work.

516
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:17,430
And we're going to allow
20 requests to come

517
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,340
through at a time.

518
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,780
So that's pretty much all you
have to do to get started to

519
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,870
make it into a server socket.

520
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,860
But the thing is, it's not that

521
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,090
interesting once you do that.

522
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,670
You basically want to get
notification that it's all

523
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,920
worked and everything is fine.

524
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,360
So if we've done it right,
console.log, I don't know,

525
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
listening, listen &mdash; you
know, I can't spell.

526
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,300
I've found, in the past three
weeks, that my spelling is

527
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,120
absolutely atrocious.

528
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,800
I just noticed a spelling
mistake, result.

529
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,710
So basically the console will
just log the fact that we made

530
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,440
a connection and everything's
fine.

531
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,030
If it's not fine, we'll get an
error here and an exception.

532
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,410
So we won't be able to
do anything else.

533
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,650
And now what we need to do is be
able to start to listen and

534
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:07,020
accept our first connection
coming in.

535
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,570
So let's just go over this a
little bit, because there's a

536
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,940
lot that's going on,
in a relatively

537
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,330
short amount of time.

538
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,040
So in this case, we've made
our socket, created it.

539
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,290
It's there.

540
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:18,760
It's ready.

541
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,050
The system knows about it.

542
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,530
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

543
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,250
PAUL KINLAN: And then we've
just said, listen.

544
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,910
So the idea here normally is,
in a client application, you

545
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,550
do connect.

546
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,160
You create a socket and then
you connect to a remote

547
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,710
service or you send some
data via a UDP request.

548
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,666
That's not what we're doing.

549
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,410
That's a client application.

550
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,820
This is service application,
a server application.

551
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,950
So we're just saying listen on
port &mdash; well, listen on IP

552
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,130
address 127.0.0.1
on port 8081.

553
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,030
Now I've hard coded in 127,
just because it just

554
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,060
illustrates the point.

555
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,560
You can actually get a list of
the network interfaces and let

556
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,360
the user choose which
IP address.

557
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,790
PETE LEPAGE: Which IP address
they want or which network

558
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,340
adapter they want
to listen on.

559
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,520
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, essentially,
yeah.

560
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,250
So that then lets you
get the IP address.

561
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,240
And then you can listen on a
public IP address if your

562
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,460
browser was &mdash;

563
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,030
PETE LEPAGE: Multi-homed or
something like that, yeah.

564
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,710
PAUL KINLAN: But I mean
normally, if you've got a

565
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,530
local network and you want to
try connect to it, then you

566
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,182
can bind to your Ethernet card
or your WiFi adapter and then

567
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:15,200
have the requests come in.

568
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,970
PETE LEPAGE: Well this could be
an interesting scenario for

569
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,700
those people who want to write
a proxy server at home &mdash; and

570
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,270
have a proxy server sit at home,
that they could go and

571
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,370
just basically write something
that proxies out network

572
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,790
connections effectively.

573
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,350
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, you could
actually do that.

574
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,170
That's actually pretty cool.

575
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,150
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

576
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,500
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, and that's
all done by JavaScript HTML.

577
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,140
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly.

578
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,070
So one of things I want to call
out here that, when I

579
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,860
first started writing some of
these network connection

580
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,820
things, it took me a second to
go, oh, great, I love this.

581
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,370
You do get into a bit of
call back fun, right?

582
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,910
So on the create, it actually
has a call back that says,

583
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,160
once it's created, call
this function.

584
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,790
Then, once you've created the
socket, then you actually have

585
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,920
to tell the socket what to do.

586
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,730
So you actually have to go
and work with a couple of

587
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,610
different pieces.

588
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,160
So when you look at this,
remember, to think through,

589
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,410
OK, what's this call
back going to do?

590
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,290
How's this going to work,
in each of these pieces?

591
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,340
PAUL KINLAN: I think that's the
important thing, right?

592
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,440
We're just using the call backs
here because it keeps

593
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,635
everything in one lump.

594
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,910
You probably want
to do a bind.

595
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,750
And you basically just pass
everything, like marginalize

596
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,030
your JavaScript a little
better than

597
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,560
we're going to do today.

598
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,040
Basically just bind and let the
the object and scope flow

599
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,820
through to function calls .

600
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,070
The interesting thing is that
this is a common problem that

601
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,130
JavaScript developers do.

602
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,930
And if you're using Node, for
instance, there's a whole of

603
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,890
NPM modules, which I try to make
asynchronous call back

604
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,030
management a lot easier.

605
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,680
Can I call that an
open challenge?

606
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,720
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

607
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,670
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know.

608
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,162
I don't know how I'm going
to do this just yet.

609
00:22:57,162 --> 00:23:00,685
But I would absolutely love to
see, now that we're getting

610
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:02,630
some parity between the features
and functionality

611
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,830
available on Node.js, is if we
can leverage some of the

612
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,520
functionality that people have
built in to Node, whether it's

613
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,400
connect, even like the web
socket servers and all this

614
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,040
type of stuff.

615
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,350
All these functions, if we can
write in a light wrapper

616
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,630
around the APIs that are in
Node, that will be brilliant.

617
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,950
If you just get them imported
into Chrome.

618
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,940
And then we've got a similar
ecosystem across the server

619
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,630
and then also across
the browser.

620
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,190
What you know is your server
inside the browser, which on

621
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,410
the client would be
pretty powerful.

622
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,080
And then we've got big ecosystem
of application

623
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,190
functionality then available
to developers.

624
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,540
PETE LEPAGE: Yes.

625
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,210
PAUL KINLAN: It would be cool.

626
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:37,850
Get Meteor on.

627
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,260
That would be brilliant, Meteor
in the browser talking

628
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,940
to the browser.

629
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,862
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

630
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:43,170
PAUL KINLAN: Sweet.

631
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,315
Yeah, I was going to say I'll
buy someone an Nexus

632
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:46,510
7 if they do that.

633
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,780
But I don't think I'm
allowed to say that.

634
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,190
PETE LEPAGE: No, probably not.

635
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,570
Well, unless you wanted to buy
yourself an extra set &mdash;

636
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,840
PAUL KINLAN: I would buy
it myself, actually.

637
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,010
If someone did it, and they did
it I'd buy them a Nexus 7.

638
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,080
PETE LEPAGE: So just to be
clear, it's not a promise.

639
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,480
But I think if they show
something pretty cool, I think

640
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,780
there might be some good
recognition for them.

641
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,360
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

642
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,270
Definitely.

643
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,670
PETE LEPAGE: All right, so let's
hop back into this code.

644
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,870
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I'm trying
to work out how much trouble

645
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,800
that we're going to be in.

646
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,055
Well, I'm going to be in now.

647
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,730
PETE LEPAGE: Eh.

648
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,980
PAUL KINLAN: So let's
jump in, right.

649
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,870
So we got the connection.

650
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,475
And I'm really sorry
about going up and

651
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:23,010
down through the code.

652
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,500
I just made a little
mistake then.

653
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,520
So I'll just jump in, right.

654
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,025
Let's split the window, so
you can see the code.

655
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:34,910
This is why I like
vim It's cool.

656
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,330
But also your preferred text
editor is also cool.

657
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,193
I'm not going to get into
a war about this.

658
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:40,310
PETE LEPAGE: I was
going to say, I

659
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,430
think Sublime is awesome.

660
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,590
But you know.

661
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,060
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I know.

662
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,920
PETE LEPAGE: Whatever
floats your boat.

663
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,050
Actually while you get yourself
set up there, I do

664
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,620
want to mention one
thing real quick.

665
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,270
If people who are watching this
have questions, they want

666
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,040
to know maybe a little bit
deeper, please post your

667
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,410
questions on Moderator.

668
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,930
The link is there on
screen right now.

669
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,320
You can just go to Moderator
and post a few questions.

670
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,430
And we'll take those questions
as we get towards the end of

671
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,220
the session today.

672
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,110
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, that's
pretty cool.

673
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,110
We've got one or two &mdash;

674
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,510
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, we got
a couple good ones.

675
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,700
PAUL KINLAN: Which we will be
able to answer as well.

676
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,590
They're going to be good.

677
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,880
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

678
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,180
So stay tuned.

679
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,430
PAUL KINLAN: Let's go
back to the code.

680
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,850

681
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,190
I apologize, two
seconds, again.

682
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,800
Hey.

683
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,000
PETE LEPAGE: 1, 1,000,
2, 1,000.

684
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,160
I'm going to give you trouble.

685
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,050
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, dude.

686
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm ready.

687
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,480
Don't worry.

688
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,010
PETE LEPAGE: All right,
all you then.

689
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,280
PAUL KINLAN: I was adding
to the suspense.

690
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,830
So we talked about it before,
socket.accept.

691
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,534
accept takes a connection that's
come in, off the queue,

692
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:41,940
and then allows you
to process it.

693
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,170
So in theory, we
have this here.

694
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,320
So we say, I need to accept the
connection that's coming

695
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,990
from the particular socket
that we've created.

696
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,700
And there's a call back
called onaccept.

697
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,960
And we're going to jump
to onaccept now

698
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,840
and fill that out.

699
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,300
Because what actually happens
is kind of interesting.

700
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,090
It's part of the API.

701
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,080
And it's something that I found
a little bit confusing,

702
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,970
when I first played with
it, is you can

703
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,460
only call accept once.

704
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,180
And you can only process
one request that's

705
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,260
come in at a time.

706
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,300
So it's very single threaded
in this sense.

707
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,980
So if you're doing a whole lot
of processing and someone's

708
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,250
uploaded a big file to your
socket, then what you should

709
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,020
really do is try and delegate
that work off to a web worker

710
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,600
or something similar to that,
very much like you do in Node,

711
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,220
essentially, just maintain the
asychrononicity at least.

712
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,990
onaccept is the call back that
happens when we know we've got

713
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,160
some data that's come back in.

714
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,710
So the very first time we do
this, there's going to be

715
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,090
nothing happening.

716
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,560
Because I haven't gone back
to my browser and

717
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,620
actually made a request.

718
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,390
When I do make a request,
onaccept will be called.

719
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,950
And what we need to do is we
need to jump up to my previous

720
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,180
window and start filling
this out.

721
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,020
Now what we do here is,
actually, we read the data

722
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,230
from the socket into
our application.

723
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,120
I mean, we don't have to.

724
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,770
But otherwise, it would
be a pretty rubbish

725
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,410
application, right?

726
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,640
So what we're going to do is
we're going to call a simple &mdash;

727
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,850
and there's a lot
of code in here.

728
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,020
So please follow along.

729
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,960
It's going to be
a bit awkward.

730
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,970
So acceptInfo.socketID
function readInfo.

731
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,100
And this is where you're going
to see all the call backs that

732
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,276
we mentioned earlier on.

733
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:12,350
PETE LEPAGE: Oh goody.

734
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,360
Oh goody.

735
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,610
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah,
it's awesome.

736
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,890
So what we've done here is, now
that we know that we've

737
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,850
been called, a connection has
been made to our server, we

738
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,960
say, we'll need to read
from the socket.

739
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,400
Notice how we are using
acceptInfo socket, not

740
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,980
socketInfo as the variable.

741
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,370
This is because the actual
request that's come in

742
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,640
basically isn't on the same
socket as the one that you're

743
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,120
listening on.

744
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,070
The way that underlined system
works is it delegates it back

745
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,530
off to the system.

746
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,330
And there's a separate channel
that enables you to

747
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,990
communicate back
to the service.

748
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,310
So we've got a different
socket.

749
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,710
So that's fine.

750
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,755
We'll read through it.

751
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:46,740
We call a read.

752
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,760
And, in theory, what you'd
see here now is &mdash;

753
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,170
I'm just going to put
it in so we know &mdash;

754
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,080
is you would see all the data
that's come back in.

755
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,850
readInfo itself has got
a data property.

756
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,610
So let's just get it off.

757
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,460
Actually, let's convert
it to a string first.

758
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,710
arrayBufferToString.

759
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,530

760
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,040
And this is a function that
I've made myself.

761
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,140
It's not in the call
library system.

762
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,960
But there we go, right.

763
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,595
So the idea behind this now is
that we've gone through, got

764
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:16,710
the data out, called

765
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,400
arrayBufferToString, which is here.

766
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,770
We basically take the
array buffer,

767
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,150
convert it to a string.

768
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,960
And the reason why we
do this is because &mdash;

769
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,690
wait for it &mdash;

770
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,340
PETE LEPAGE: I'm waiting.

771
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,930
I'm waiting.

772
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,550
PAUL KINLAN: We need
to read from it.

773
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,180
So what I do is I say &mdash; yeah,
it's exciting &mdash; indexOf.

774
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,510
So we need to find the very
first part of the string.

775
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,950
I'm going to put a
space in there,

776
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,320
because it could be wrong.

777
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,860
Equals 0.

778
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,210
And this is basically the HTTP
header that we've got back in.

779
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,840
So we are reading from
the request.

780
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,160
We're assuming that it's
a HTTP request.

781
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,440
When it is a HTTP request, the
very first set of characters

782
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,450
in the string are the
actual method

783
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,440
that's going to be called.

784
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,070
Not the underlined method, but
the post, get, put, delete,

785
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,720
all those types things.

786
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,790
And in this case, we're
just going to look

787
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,280
for the word, get.

788
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,260
We're not going to handle
anything else.

789
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,070
That's pretty cool.

790
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,560
So if we get the word, get,
there, there's a strong

791
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,370
likelihood, at least, that the
data is a HTTP request.

792
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,920
So let's parse it a
little bit more.

793
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,000
And I'm going to take a whole
lot of liberties with this.

794
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640

795
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,190
We're going to get the
end of the URI.

796
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,370
So the thing that comes after
the get request &mdash;

797
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:36,260
and I'm sorry for doing
an HTTP 101 here &mdash;

798
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,430
is actually the URL that
you're fetching.

799
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,830
So just substring uriEnd.

800
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,120
So we're just going
to parse this out.

801
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,790
And we're going to just assume
that it all works.

802
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:51,690
And we're then going to get
the file from filesMap.

803
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,590
That's what we said before.

804
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,980
When we clicked on the
directory, like the file

805
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,380
picker button we have
the ability

806
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,140
to select the directory.

807
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,910
We take all those files in that
directory and store them

808
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,747
in a hash with the URL,
basically, of

809
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:06,780
the local file system.

810
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,730
And then we map that
on, using this.

811
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,870
So what we'll see here is, if
a web request comes into our

812
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,680
server, forward slash index
dot HTML, we'll see that.

813
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,840
We'll get the URI out.

814
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,665
And then we'll look for a file
called index dot HTML in our

815
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:23,070
memory collection of files.

816
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,840
Which is pretty cool.

817
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,380
And then this is going to
look silly, because it

818
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,170
doesn't exist yet.

819
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,670
But write response is a function
that we've made.

820
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,350

821
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,100
Info.socketId file.

822
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,690
This is just a function
that we've made.

823
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,050
And we're going to
go to it now.

824
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,100
PETE LEPAGE: So before
you pop down there.

825
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,000

826
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,830
Where you've got your file,
when you went to hit your

827
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,050
semicolon, you actually
got an A in there, at

828
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,470
the end of that line.

829
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,430
PAUL KINLAN: Dude, thank
you very much.

830
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,790
PETE LEPAGE: Wow,
now we got an R.

831
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,430
PAUL KINLAN: It's gone now.

832
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:56,770
It should be there.

833
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,010
PETE LEPAGE: Now
write200Response.

834
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:04,060
Now why is it write200Response
versus writeResponse?

835
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,910
PAUL KINLAN: Basically, it was
just the way I decided to try

836
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,000
and structure the application.

837
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,500
I was going to say that, if I
can't find the file, I would

838
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,790
try and write a 400 response,
going out.

839
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,900
From the verbosity of it, it
made sense when I was looking

840
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,520
at it, just to say
write200Response.

841
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,350
writeResponse with a status code
would probably be better.

842
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,370
PETE LEPAGE: Fair enough.

843
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:22,980
OK.

844
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,840
PAUL KINLAN: No, we
can refer to this.

845
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,980
And if anyone wants to take the
code, fork it, and make it

846
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,550
look a lot nicer, then
super-fine by me.

847
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,950
PETE LEPAGE: That would
be super cool.

848
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,260
PAUL KINLAN: This
is our function.

849
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,530
We take the socketID.

850
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,800
So the socketID, this is the
network socket the network

851
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,960
port that we're going to write
back to the client, write back

852
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,300
to the web browser
with the data on.

853
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,000
So we have the file.

854
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,170
We're going to work out
the contentType.

855
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,660
Luckily the file object, in
a lot of cases, has the

856
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,900
contentType on.

857
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,990
I'd just assume that, if the
contentType doesn't exist,

858
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,704
it's called text plain.

859
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,560
That's probably not the best
assumption, but it was

860
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,050
reasonable.

861
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,020
contentLength, you're a good
web citizen if put the

862
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,360
contentLength on.

863
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,530
So we get the file size.

864
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,870
So the actual size of the
file is stored in

865
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,990
the file system object.

866
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,070
It's pretty cool.

867
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,600
And then we do this thing
called header.

868
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,710
We make a header.

869
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,670
And the reason why is because,
when you do a network

870
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,330
response, you have to put a
HTTP header at the top.

871
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,156
And then you also, at the
bottom, you have to then put

872
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:17,990
the file contents.

873
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,750
And the HTTP header basically
says what type of protocol

874
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,620
you're using, whether
it's HTTP1, 1.1.

875
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,640
The status code, 200
in this case &mdash;

876
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,750
200 is success and
the word, OK.

877
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,960
And then some extra
information, like

878
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,940
contentLength and contentType.

879
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,250
Now we're using the inverse
of a stringToArrayBuffer &mdash;

880
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,815
oh sorry.

881
00:32:37,815 --> 00:32:39,270
PETE LEPAGE:arrayToStringBuffer.

882
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,760
We're using stringToArrayBuffer.

883
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,590
PAUL KINLAN: We're now making
an array buffer.

884
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,620
So it's converting this single
string that we've got, which

885
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,350
is a collection of the header
information, essentially.

886
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,950
Two, we're take basically taking
that data, making an

887
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,860
array buffer, so that we can
send that out to the client.

888
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,450
Now the interesting thing, and
the way I've done this &mdash; and

889
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,530
it's probably not the best
way, again &mdash; is I've just

890
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,600
assumed that I want to
glob all the data &mdash;

891
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,740
the header and the response &mdash;
into one write.

892
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,710
I don't have to do that.

893
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,490
I probably shouldn't
do that that way.

894
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,740
Anyway you have an output
buffer, which is the

895
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,760
combination of the HTTP header
and the actual file body

896
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,530
itself, the raw file data that
we're going to pull back in.

897
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,875
Now we have this.

898
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:19,270
Excuse me.

899
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,860
So we have the view.

900
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,260
The view is basically just the
way that you can actually put

901
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,680
data into an array buffer.

902
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,610
You can't put data into an array
buffer directly, so we

903
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,100
have to do some work.

904
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,870
The array buffer itself
is the header length

905
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,360
plus the file length.

906
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:38,390
We put the header at the very
start of the array buffer,

907
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,450
which is what you need.

908
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,510
And then we need to put
the body at the end.

909
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,180
Now the interesting thing
here is, this is the

910
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,850
asynchronous bit again.

911
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:49,940
You have to use the HTML5 file
reader API, because we've got

912
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,740
a file object.

913
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,460
We don't have access
to the bytes.

914
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,510
We need to basically ask the
system to give us that

915
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,540
information.

916
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,930
So we use the file reader
API, in this case.

917
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,150
It's one single call,
fileReader, listen to onload,

918
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,914
so that we know that the file's
been loaded up and is

919
00:34:03,914 --> 00:34:06,485
all ready to go.

920
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:09,350
And we then, finally say,
readAsArrayBuffer.

921
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,010
So the file object can be
returned is an array buffer.

922
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,260
And the idea behind what we're
going to do now is once the

923
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,050
file data's come in, we're going
to stuff that into the

924
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,080
array buffer itself, right at
the end, after the header.

925
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,560
So we have this one big glob of
data that we're just going

926
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,406
to send out to the client.

927
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:28,980
PETE LEPAGE: So Paul, one of the
things, if someone wanted

928
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,900
to refactor this, one way they
could do it, to make it

929
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,449
potentially a much faster web
server, is on start up, when

930
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:39,489
it reads that directory,
depending on how many files

931
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,349
there are, it could load all
of those files into memory.

932
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:43,230
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

933
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,159
PETE LEPAGE: And then just keep
them there, so that it

934
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,830
just always was able to
immediately respond with them

935
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,420
and have them &mdash;

936
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,389
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, so I mean it
seems a little heavyweight

937
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,420
to do what we're doing
right now, honestly.

938
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,989
But it's just there
to show the point.

939
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:55,929
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

940
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,060
PAUL KINLAN: But the other
thing, as well, is you can

941
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,440
actually do two socket writes,
sending the data

942
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,260
back over the socket.

943
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,960
You could do two writes.

944
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,810
You could write the header
and then write

945
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,490
the body just after.

946
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,450
That's like two asynchronous
calls.

947
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,610
It's a little bit harder to
orchestrate, but then we don't

948
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,530
have to block the user interface
on trying to

949
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,250
construct these two larger
objects together.

950
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,050
PETE LEPAGE: Though admittedly,
in this app, there

951
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,000
isn't much of a user
interface.

952
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,310
So blocking on that would
not be a huge deal.

953
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,180
But you still don't
want to do that.

954
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,850
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, exactly.

955
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,670
So let's go and see where
we can go from here.

956
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,720
So we want to do the
socket.write.

957
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,040
So we're going to write to the
socket, write the data from

958
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,490
the file system API to
the web, essentially.

959
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,472
It's pretty cool.

960
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:36,840
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

961
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,130
PAUL KINLAN: And this should
be simple socketId

962
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,800
outputBuffer &mdash;

963
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,970
be careful how I spell
that one out &mdash;

964
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,575
function writeInfo.

965
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:52,270
And again, another nice,
very cute call back.

966
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,555
PETE LEPAGE: Ah, got to
love those call backs.

967
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:57,655
PAUL KINLAN: I believe
that is not needed.

968
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,730

969
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,990
And in theory, that's
it, right?

970
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,590
But we want a little bit
more information.

971
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,820
So we've taken the data and
we constructed the header

972
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,530
response and also the
body response.

973
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,990
And we've written it
out in one go.

974
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,970
To be a good citizen, actually,
what we need to do

975
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,660
is actually destroy
the socket.

976
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,200
So one of the things I found
out, when I was doing this is

977
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,230
the number of sockets, if you
don't destroy them, once

978
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,160
you've finished the connection,
and you've written

979
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,473
the data out, and you're happy
that the client's got the

980
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:28,294
data, the application will
probably crash at some point

981
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:29,590
in the future.

982
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,400
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, because
there are a

983
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,160
limited number of sockets.

984
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,890
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah,
essentially.

985
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,480
PETE LEPAGE: Now, do you
need to destroy and

986
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,630
close or just destroy?

987
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,360
PAUL KINLAN: You might
need to close.

988
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,670
I just did destroy, and
it seems to work.

989
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,280
I should probably be a
better citizen and

990
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,330
also close it as well.

991
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,010
But what I'm doing here, this
is the thing that got me

992
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,835
before when I was
starting this.

993
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:50,283
Because overall, it took me
about an hour and a half to

994
00:36:50,283 --> 00:36:51,180
make this whole application.

995
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,890
It's pretty cool.

996
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,720
socket.accept, you need to
call that again, because

997
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,740
you've handled the request.

998
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,870
You basically need to tell the
system that you want to pick

999
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,670
off the next request again.

1000
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,940
Because you can only have
one of those in flight.

1001
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,940
I chose to do it in this type of
queue here, because you can

1002
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,570
only have one in flight.

1003
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,440
I need to know that what we've
done has completed

1004
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,350
successfully, in which
case it's the write.

1005
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,270
And, in theory &mdash;

1006
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,300
oh, tell you what.

1007
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,300
That should be it.

1008
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,080
Let me just go to the end.

1009
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,600
I know there's a Stop button.

1010
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,130
We should also do socket.destroy
to kill the

1011
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,735
server socket.

1012
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:25,985
oh, info.socketId.

1013
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:30,370

1014
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:34,350
And that is all we actually
need to do.

1015
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,610
We have our server.

1016
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,040
Shall we test it?

1017
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,400
PETE LEPAGE: Let's test it.

1018
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,000
PAUL KINLAN: Should
we test it live?

1019
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,160
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

1020
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,580
PAUL KINLAN: So I have an
extension web server file.

1021
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,462
It's not that one.

1022
00:37:48,462 --> 00:37:49,710
And it's not that one.

1023
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,300
That was my test.

1024
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,870
That was one of my
other tests.

1025
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,680
Hey, funny.

1026
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,560
PETE LEPAGE: There you go.

1027
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,130
PAUL KINLAN: So it hasn't
crashed yet.

1028
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,890
PETE LEPAGE: Sweet.

1029
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,762
PAUL KINLAN: Launch.

1030
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:04,175
Shall we see if there's
any errors?

1031
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:06,990
No errors so far.

1032
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,495
Choose files.

1033
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,470
Choose that app directory.

1034
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,370
PETE LEPAGE: Nice.

1035
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,330
Nice.

1036
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,570
PAUL KINLAN: No errors.

1037
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,620
Start.

1038
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,590
No errors.

1039
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,480
Oh.

1040
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,340
PETE LEPAGE: No whammies,
no whammies,

1041
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,590
no whammy, no whammy.

1042
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,760

1043
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,032
PAUL KINLAN: 81, because &mdash;

1044
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:28,910
yay!

1045
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,860
It worked.

1046
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,860
PETE LEPAGE: Congratulations.

1047
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,350
Nice job, sir.

1048
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,600
PAUL KINLAN: Oh my.

1049
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,490

1050
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,010
That's it, right.

1051
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,110
That's the whole basic premise
of what we're trying to do

1052
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,100
with this, in like 30 minutes.

1053
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,320
And we've gone through this.

1054
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,210
And we talked an obviously
long time here.

1055
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,980
We built a basic server that
allows you to serve data from

1056
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,200
your local machine, your local
Chrome OS box, your MacBook,

1057
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,030
all those types of things, serve
it directly to the user.

1058
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,070
Offline, online, however you
want to do it, you can do it.

1059
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,330
Obviously, it's a very
simple server.

1060
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,355
It only handles get requests.

1061
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,360
It doesn't do pokes and all
that type of stuff.

1062
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,750
But you can see what's
going to happen.

1063
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,740
And like I said, if you can
get some of the Node based

1064
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,320
spaces, like the server work,
a lot of people have already

1065
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,805
done in that whole ecosystem.

1066
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:11,560
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

1067
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,070
PAUL KINLAN: I know there's
quite a bit of mapping that

1068
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,010
needs to be done, because
there's a buffer, which is

1069
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,810
different to our array buffer
and all that type of stuff.

1070
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,855
So there needs to be some
marshalling and munging in

1071
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:22,072
between the two bits there.

1072
00:39:22,072 --> 00:39:24,320
And I think it's one of the
things, like it would be so

1073
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,920
cool if you could test your
entire stack without

1074
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,890
necessarily having to have
Node.js sever installed.

1075
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,520
On your MacBook Pro and your
Windows machine, you'll have

1076
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,020
that on anyway.

1077
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,000
But if you've got a Chrome OS
box, right now, it's like &mdash;

1078
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,290
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

1079
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,220
PAUL KINLAN: That would
be pretty sweet.

1080
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,250
You could start to test out your
Node based application,

1081
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,140
inside the browser, from
your Chrome OS machine.

1082
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,060
PETE LEPAGE: Or you could,
effectively, go and just do

1083
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,955
any of the development that you
want to do on your Chrome

1084
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:53,150
Book and have a server
running locally.

1085
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,760
So I just put the URL
for the network

1086
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,310
documentation up on screen.

1087
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,530
So if you want to dive into this
a little bit deeper, you

1088
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,070
can see the URL there.

1089
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,340
And that'll take you to the
Chrome apps documentation,

1090
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,830
where all of this stuff goes
into much more detail, all of

1091
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,440
the different APIs the connect,
the destroy, the

1092
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,690
close, all of those fun
things that you do

1093
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,530
need to know about.

1094
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,280
PAUL KINLAN: The &mdash;

1095
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,930
I'm sorry.

1096
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,170
PETE LEPAGE: No, go ahead.

1097
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,730
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, the thing I'd
just like to say is that

1098
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,570
this API is pretty cool.

1099
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,900
It's very powerful.

1100
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,350
It's something that we've
not seen inside

1101
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,490
Chrome before, at least.

1102
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,240
But the thing for me is it's
going to enable so

1103
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,010
many more use cases.

1104
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,070
It's going to be really cool.

1105
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,760
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

1106
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,960
PAUL KINLAN: Personally, I'd
like more high level APIs.

1107
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,450
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

1108
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,390
PAUL KINLAN: So if someone could
make like and FTP API or

1109
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,950
DNS API and all those different
types of APIs that

1110
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,790
other developers can just use
and say, you know what?

1111
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,220
I want to connect to an FTP
client or an FTP service.

1112
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,800
Or I want to make it
my own FTP service.

1113
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,510
And it just works.

1114
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,880
PETE LEPAGE: Abolutely.

1115
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,715
PAUL KINLAN: I'd love
that to happen.

1116
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:50,030
That would be absolutely
brilliant.

1117
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,760
PETE LEPAGE: So actually that's
a perfect segue into

1118
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,240
some of the questions.

1119
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,920
Because one of the first
questions that's in there is,

1120
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,240
could you summarize, at a high
level, what the new use cases

1121
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,010
you see in enabling
in our apps are?

1122
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,650
Any particular use cases
that you want to see?

1123
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,020
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

1124
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,980
PETE LEPAGE: So I know for me,
there's a couple that I've

1125
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,090
been playing with lately.

1126
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,550
Things like there's a little box
that you can buy called an

1127
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,100
IP to IR converter.

1128
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,180
And I've just been playing
with this.

1129
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,480
I know it's completely dorky.

1130
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,050

1131
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,530
So it plugs into your
network port.

1132
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,310
And then it's got IR
blasters on it.

1133
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:30,630
So you can then use that to
control your TV, your anything

1134
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,800
that's controlled via IR.

1135
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,130
So I'm working on writing a
little Chrome app that will

1136
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,680
allow me to turn my air
conditioner on and off, will

1137
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,190
allow me to turn the TV on and
off, do all sorts of crazy

1138
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,180
little things like that.

1139
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,910
So that's one case.

1140
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,650
But other things are being able
to write servers, like we

1141
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,240
talked about, being able to
go and communicate with

1142
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,440
appliances that you normally
wouldn't be able to

1143
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,680
communicate with.

1144
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,570
What are some of the ones that
you're excited about, Paul?

1145
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,395
PAUL KINLAN: Use cases
or appliances?

1146
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,150
PETE LEPAGE: Both.

1147
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,870
PAUL KINLAN: Both.

1148
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,750
Appliances, ah, so many.

1149
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,730
I really like the idea &mdash;
so we got a demo

1150
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,570
for the Media Center.

1151
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,310
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

1152
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,920
PAUL KINLAN: I want to be able
to access all my media around

1153
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,230
my house, brings into
my Chrome app.

1154
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,130
And if I go on a plane, I can
just download it straight to

1155
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,850
my Chrome Book and still
play and listen to it.

1156
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,770
It's pretty cool.

1157
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,420
So we've got that
type of demo.

1158
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,517
That type of interaction is
something you just don't get

1159
00:42:22,517 --> 00:42:23,290
in the browser, right?

1160
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:23,550
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

1161
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:23,810
PAUL KINLAN: Right now.

1162
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,230
And it's pretty cool.

1163
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,000
Some of the other stuff, so
services, in an actual way,

1164
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,430
this is important for me.

1165
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,495
You know, literally, I want us
to be able to build services

1166
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:34,390
and services in our
applications.

1167
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,625
I think one of the questions
is I should've built a Bit

1168
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:37,540
Torrent client.

1169
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,750
Yeah, we can build a
Bit Torrent client.

1170
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,170
I just don't know
how to do it.

1171
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,415
I don't know the protocol.

1172
00:42:41,415 --> 00:42:44,580
It probably would've been a
bit longer than this talk.

1173
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,370
But yeah, those are the types of
things that we are enabled

1174
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,300
to do now, in the sense
that we can have

1175
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,200
a Bit Torrent client.

1176
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,670
And you could, in theory, just
open ports that you need to

1177
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,690
listen to the requests coming in
to share the data back out.

1178
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,310
And so you could quite easily do
it &mdash; well, sort of easily.

1179
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,026
The API is there for you
to be able do that.

1180
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,780
That would be pretty cool.

1181
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,220
FTP services, FTP servers,
FTP clients.

1182
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,940
You know, there's so many people
who still actually use

1183
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,880
FTP, a lot of web developers
who use FTP.

1184
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,150
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

1185
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,630
PAUL KINLAN: Not even FTPS, just
plain FTP to get the data

1186
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,890
around places and up
on the web host,

1187
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,470
those types of things.

1188
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,040
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

1189
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,110
PAUL KINLAN: I was actually
thinking it might have been

1190
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,150
cool for like a cURL
on the web.

1191
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,020
You always see these things,
like cURL on the web, where

1192
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,810
you don't serve it, necessarily,
but like a normal

1193
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,990
client request.

1194
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,650
Just debug the HTTP
requests, without

1195
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,610
having to go into DevTools.

1196
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,910
You can just put it all in.

1197
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,600
And you don't need the remote
server to do it.

1198
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,040
You can do all type of stuff.

1199
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,100
The interesting thing, we don't
have any access to the

1200
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,180
really, really low layers
of the API.

1201
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,260
So you can't do pings.

1202
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,050
Like [INAUDIBLE] stuff,
you can't do.

1203
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:41,500
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

1204
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,700
PAUL KINLAN: But
you can do DNS.

1205
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,750
DNS clients, I want a whole load
of APIs available, high

1206
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,520
level APIs available.

1207
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,660
Let me just fire off
a DNS request or a

1208
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,510
network time request.

1209
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:50,770
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

1210
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,520
PAUL KINLAN: And all these types
of things would be cool.

1211
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:52,620
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

1212
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,730
And then we can build
some really cool

1213
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,200
applications on it.

1214
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,895
The first one that always comes
to mind &mdash; and this is I

1215
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:59,190
think why we did the web
developer, kind of the web

1216
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,040
server, is because this is
something web developers want

1217
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,610
to be able to do on their
Chrome Books.

1218
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,490
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

1219
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,440
PAUL KINLAN: So I think
we can enable that.

1220
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,290
And it would be pretty cool if
someone like Cloud Nine or

1221
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,952
someone else comes along and
says, yeah, we can do that

1222
00:44:09,952 --> 00:44:10,260
while you're offline.

1223
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,535
That would be cool.

1224
00:44:10,535 --> 00:44:12,880
PETE LEPAGE: We'll pop that
into our development

1225
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,680
environment.

1226
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,550
So Louise, from Phoenix, wants
to know is there a way to do a

1227
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:23,540
broadcast to find other servers
to use this for

1228
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,240
LAN-based HTML5 game servers?

1229
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,330
And the answer is, yes.

1230
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,800
Right now, there's a bug
with UDP listen on

1231
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,920
the broadcast port.

1232
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,680
So that's not going to work.

1233
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,530
And the engineers are aware
of that, and they're

1234
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,910
looking into that one.

1235
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,520
But you can, certainly, once
that gets fixed, you'll be

1236
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:49,690
able to listen for UDP
broadcasts sent out.

1237
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,600
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, our Media
Gallery sample on GitHub &mdash;

1238
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:52,940
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

1239
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,110
That actually does that
type of thing.

1240
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,600
But it's a little bit broken
at the moment.

1241
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,123
The thing it does, it basically
fires off of, I

1242
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:02,520
think, it's 239.245.255's
address.

1243
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:02,775
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

1244
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:04,345
PAUL KINLAN: Which is like the
UDP broadcast, essentially,

1245
00:45:04,345 --> 00:45:05,595
for DNLA discovery.

1246
00:45:05,595 --> 00:45:08,470

1247
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,230
And then basically, you
will fire that off.

1248
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,070
That's fired and you can do
the broadcast, but at the

1249
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,900
other end, you need to
be able to listen.

1250
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,370
And like Pete said,
that API did work.

1251
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:19,240
But I think someone stopped
working recently.

1252
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,730
But should be able to find &mdash;

1253
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,590
do a UDP bind to port 0 and
then receive all these

1254
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,380
responses back in.

1255
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:25,870
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

1256
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,430
PAUL KINLAN: And that
should all work.

1257
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,370
PETE LEPAGE: So we've got
another question of, how many

1258
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,060
requests can it handle
at a time?

1259
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,060
If you have to destroy and start
accepting again, does

1260
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,330
that mean you can only accept
one request at a time?

1261
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,170
PAUL KINLAN: Yes is the answer
right now, only one

1262
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,370
request at a time.

1263
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,710
But if you look at the way Node
works, its relatively

1264
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,410
similar, right?

1265
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,470
I mean Node only processes
one request.

1266
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,920
It trys to then delegate the
rest of the functionality to

1267
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,680
other asynchronous parts of
the system, then handle

1268
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,460
responses that way.

1269
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,830
And if you look at the Python
Tornado server, it was a

1270
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,340
similar thing.

1271
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,750
You could only handle one
request at a time coming in.

1272
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,115
So yeah, right now, that's
the only way you

1273
00:46:04,115 --> 00:46:05,230
can do it just yet.

1274
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,910
The idea is that you would
take the request.

1275
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,070
And you'd background it.

1276
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,950
I mean all these APIs
are asynchronous.

1277
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,130
So we might actually be
able to take multiple

1278
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,170
ones, earlier on.

1279
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,460
I'm trying to think how
the accept works now.

1280
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,310
I haven't actually tested it
with trying to delegate these,

1281
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,110
like finish the accept
off really early.

1282
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,370
So just say, you know what, we
finished with the accept, go

1283
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,120
off and do whatever you want.

1284
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:26,760
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

1285
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,880
PAUL KINLAN: I haven't
tried that just yet.

1286
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,760
But right now it's
one at a time.

1287
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,750
It's pretty speedy for what
we're trying to do as basic

1288
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,000
file serving.

1289
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,720

1290
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,560
PETE LEPAGE: This is something
that I think works perfectly

1291
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,790
for a development environment
or a little test environment

1292
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:45,620
or maybe something you want to
write for controlling of an

1293
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,850
application like the IP to IR
controller, where you're only

1294
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,970
going to have a couple people
connecting to it at any time.

1295
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,880
You're not going to have
the entire world.

1296
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,280
It's not designed, in this
particular case, to scale.

1297
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,530
Now you absolutely could write
scale with this stuff.

1298
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:05,090
But the way we've written
it won't scale well.

1299
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,450
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

1300
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,825
The way I've written this
application it probably won't

1301
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,070
scale well at all.

1302
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:16,190
I think it's a very
general API.

1303
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,880
It's the POSIX socket
API essentially.

1304
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,850
So we can build systems that
scale quite easily.

1305
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,010
This literally landed
last week.

1306
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,490
And what we're trying to do is
start off the conversation

1307
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:28,000
about getting developers
excited about this API.

1308
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,210
And then we'll start to build
out the patterns and practices

1309
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,710
about how this should actually
be managed, from the

1310
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,890
application layer, if
that makes sense.

1311
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:36,760
So we're still early on.

1312
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,890
And if you guys want to play
with it, you just email me

1313
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:43,300
PaulKinlan@Google or catch
me pm Google+ or Twitter.

1314
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,100
And we'll just try and do
another show where we'll

1315
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,300
promote some of these things,
some of the stuff

1316
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,100
that you do as well.

1317
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,020
So that would be pretty cool.

1318
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,980
But we need to know how you
want to use these things.

1319
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,082
And the only way we'll know that
is by getting you guys to

1320
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:54,490
experiment.

1321
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:55,010
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

1322
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:57,930
PAUL KINLAN: So I encourage
everyone to play.

1323
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:58,840
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

1324
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,450
So we've got time for,
I think, about

1325
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:04,760
one or two more questions.

1326
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,540
Question was, does this work
over the internet?

1327
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,230
Yeah, it absolutely would.

1328
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:14,190
The one thing you have to be
aware of is that the network

1329
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:17,250
socket that you're listening on
has to be connected to an

1330
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,290
internet port, right.

1331
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:22,660
So in our particular case, we're
listening to 127.0.0.1.

1332
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,640
So we're listening for
our own loop back.

1333
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,160
But Paul could have said hey,
what's the IP address on my

1334
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,550
network port.

1335
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,080
And I want to listen on that.

1336
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,200
And then I could have, from here
in New York, connected to

1337
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,280
him and been able to
listen to that.

1338
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,630
But I would have had to been
able to get to his IP address.

1339
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,504
PAUL KINLAN: It's the same as
just general networking, so it

1340
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,480
should be fine.

1341
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,310
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

1342
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,905
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

1343
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:50,640
Can we do one more question
or are we over time?

1344
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,370
I think we're over time
now, aren't we?

1345
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,910
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, I think we're
a little bit over time.

1346
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,370
So with that, I want to say
thanks to Paul for joining me.

1347
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,270
And thank you guys for
all joining us.

1348
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,140
We'll be back next
week with another

1349
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,800
installment of Chrome apps.

1350
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,830
If there are things you want to
hear about, things you want

1351
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,030
us to cover in more depth,
please be sure to reach out to

1352
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,870
us, either through our own
Google+ pages &mdash; i'm Pete

1353
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,460
LePage or you can reach
to Paul Kinlan.

1354
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:21,260
Or leave a comment in one of
our Google+ pages for the

1355
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,650
Chrome developers.

1356
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,080
So with that, Paul, I think
we should try for

1357
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,350
another high five.

1358
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:28,040
All right, ready?

1359
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,020
PAUL KINLAN: Three, two, one.

1360
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,820
PETE LEPAGE: Two, one, go.

1361
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,760
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

1362
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,610
PETE LEPAGE: Yes.

1363
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,110
That was  &mdash;

1364
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:32,930
PAUL KINLAN: That didn't work?

1365
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,460
PETE LEPAGE: That was a lot
better than the first

1366
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,480
time we tried it.

1367
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,550
So all right, everybody.

1368
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:38,290
Thanks very much.

1369
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,680
Hope you have a wonderful day.

1370
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,750
And talk to you soon.

1371
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,650
Bye-bye.

1372
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:43,850
PAUL KINLAN: Thank you.

1373
