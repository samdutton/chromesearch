1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,310

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,620
Hey.

3
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,720
I wanted to give you guys a few
tips on how you can become

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,370
more of a console power-user.

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,310
If you are not familiar
with console.log, this

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,110
video is not for you.

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,940
All right.

8
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,480
First we're going to
get right into it.

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,530
You'll notice that I'm here
inside of jsFiddle.

10
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,220
It's just listing out exactly
what I'm going to be talking

11
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,450
about right now.

12
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,580
And, well, we do have a
little bit of script.

13
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,610
Over here, we've got a little
Ajax request that's going to

14
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,735
fire off whenever I
click on the page.

15
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:26,760
So we're going to fire that
Ajax request, and when it

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,800
comes back, we're going to
create a text area, add that

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,780
to the DOM, and then set the
value of the text area to be

18
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,390
whatever came back from
the Ajax request.

19
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,830
Now, I'm going to do that here,
and I click, and then

20
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,010
text areas come in.

21
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,206
That's good.

22
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:44,590
But sometimes you'll be doing
this, and you'll expect this

23
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,590
to show up in the console.

24
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,060
And by default, it
doesn't show up

25
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,710
in the Chrome DevTools.

26
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,980
You can right click and
turn on XHR logging.

27
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,400
And so now, when I have that on,
all those XHRs are logged

28
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,140
to the console, and I can go
over to Network and figure out

29
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,300
exactly the details
of those requests.

30
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,400
Now you might have noticed,
Preserve Log is here.

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,379
This is brand new.

32
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,340
So on page refreshes, your
console can stay preserved,

33
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,980
which is pretty cool.

34
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,770
So I'm going to go ahead and &mdash;

35
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,840
I think I'll keep this on.

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,550
And I'm going to show
you console.time.

37
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,660
So I type console.time up
here, and we're going

38
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,720
to give it a name.

39
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,540
And I need to say
when it ends.

40
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,490
And so console.time and timeEnd
is just a nice way for

41
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,570
you to kind of measure how
long something takes.

42
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,500
Now, you could do it yourself
with the data object, but we

43
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,990
have a little hook for it.

44
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,890
So I'm going to click, and so
now we have an idea of how

45
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,772
long it takes from the
start of the Ajax to

46
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:42,490
the end of the Ajax.

47
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,880
It's pretty cool.

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,290
Console.dir is an
interesting one.

49
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,250
And to do it, I'm going
to dir out the text

50
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,410
area that I've created.

51
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,270
And I want to show that in
comparison to console.log.

52
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,440
So we'll both log and
dir that out.

53
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,810
I'll run that, and
now I'll click.

54
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,130
So here we have &mdash;

55
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,570
this is the log view, and this
is more of like the tree-level

56
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,230
view, and console.dir gives you
more of the DOM-level view

57
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,170
of an object.

58
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,020
So sometimes you kind
of want that.

59
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,460
Now, I'm going to take this app
and blow this up into the

60
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,160
full-screen view.

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,720
And I will point out that if
you're actually typing in the

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,140
console, you could type
console.dir and do that right

63
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,560
inside the console, but you
can have a nice little

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
convenience function, so you
can just type dir directly,

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,440
and that works as well.

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,860
So there's a few other
methods that are

67
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,530
available inside the console.

68
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,220
So one of them is Inspect,
and so this is cool.

69
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,520
So I have this text area, and I
want to actually go see that

70
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,720
in the Elements tab.

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,950
And I can just type inspect.

72
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,050
We hop right over to Elements,
and it's already selected.

73
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,210
Now similarly, I might have
an element that &mdash;

74
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm seeing an element, so I
actually want to access it in

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,920
the script.

76
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,450
So I access it right here.

77
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,900
I click on that, and I'm going
to bring up Console with the

78
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,330
Escape key.

79
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,600
And $0.

80
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,050
And so that just is
a reference to

81
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,070
whatever was selected.

82
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,830
And so this just works normally,
so I can kind of do

83
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,990
whatever I want with it.

84
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,720
Another one, and this
is fun, is $$.

85
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,480
And so this is also known as
the bling bling function.

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,000
Bling bling is pretty cool.

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,270
So this is just a peek into
the DevTool source.

88
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,870
It's just a wraparound query
selector all, and so I can

89
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,650
just pass a selector to it and
see what matches on the page.

90
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,950
So here, I have two text areas
on the page, and so that's

91
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,180
what it returns.

92
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,350
It's easy as that.

93
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,700
Now, monitorEvents.

94
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,460
I'm going to show monitorEvents
to you.

95
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,430
And it does what it says
on the [? TIM. ?]

96
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,480
And monitorEvents.

97
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,130
And I'm going to pass at one
of these text areas.

98
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,080
And there we go.

99
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,150
Now, it's this text
area, here.

100
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,490
OK, cool.

101
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,010
So all the MouseEvents &mdash;

102
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,360
you see mousemove, click,

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,430
KeyboardEvents, scroll events &mdash;

104
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,410
I get to see all the events
that are firing on this

105
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,300
object, which gives you a lot
insight into what's going on.

106
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,930
Now, there is another way to do
this, in that I can do the

107
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,970
same thing, and I can pass at
a second primer of either

108
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,959
mouse or key.

109
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,560
And now, with key, I only
get the keyboard events.

110
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,800
No scroll, no mouse events.

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
So that's pretty cool.

112
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,880
Next, I want to show you
keys and values.

113
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,520
So keys gives you the names of
the keys [? in the ?] object,

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,130
all the properties
and the methods.

115
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,680
So I'm just going to
pass the document &mdash;

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,420
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

117
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,490
document.head, document.node
type.

118
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,920
There's a lot of
stuff on there.

119
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,790
Similarly, values gives me
back all the values.

120
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,760
There's a lot of different kinds
of values, a bunch of

121
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,111
functions, stuff like that.

122
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:02,510
I'm going to go back to keys for
a second, and there's some

123
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,780
pretty cool stuff in here &mdash; a
web visibility state, some

124
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,450
interesting stuff.

125
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,530
And I'd love to dig into
this a little bit more.

126
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,855
So I could copy-paste this,
but it's little awkward.

127
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:14,230
The easier way is just to call
the copy method that's built

128
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,500
right into the console.

129
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,580
This copies it to your clipboard
immediately.

130
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,550
So I can go over to my text
editor, paste it, and do

131
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,500
whatever I need to do to it.

132
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,760
Oops.

133
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,215
No, no.

134
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:30,185

135
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,760
There we go.

136
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,190
That's what I wanted.

137
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,090
All right, cool.

138
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,850
Now, I just want to show two
pretty cool techniques coming

139
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,210
from some other browsers.

140
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,465
First I'm going to head
over to Opera.

141
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:46,220
This is opera.next.

142
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,210
And we have up HTML5 Rocks, and
sometimes you just want

143
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,710
jQuery to work with.

144
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,980
On this page, we actually
don't have jQuery.

145
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,250
On Opera, I can type double
slash, and call jQuery as a

146
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,720
function, and it just
loads in jQuery.

147
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,780
It's like the jQuery
[? a.size ?]

148
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,740
bookmarklet.

149
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,760
And now I can use jQuery
to my heart's content.

150
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,530
That's pretty cool.

151
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,970
Pretty cool feature in Opera.

152
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,400
Switch over to Firefox Aurora.

153
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,500
And here we have a page
that has an iframe.

154
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:12,780
All right?

155
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,560
I'm going to open
up this iframe.

156
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,190
Look at the DOM view, and
you'll see the iframe.

157
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,880
Inside of that is a script,
and inside of

158
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,700
that script is a secret.

159
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,760
So this is a common thing.

160
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,840
You'll have a script inside.

161
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,610
You'll want to understand what's
going on inside that

162
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,710
script, but of course, your
console is operating inside

163
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,050
the context of the outside
frame, right?

164
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,465
And so, I'm asking what
the secret is, and

165
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:37,650
it's not out here.

166
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,920
It's inside there.

167
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,220
So in Firebug, you can
type "cd." And

168
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,810
cd changes the context.

169
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,320
And so, I'm actually going to
go and select that frame.

170
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,520
There's that frame.

171
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,030
And now I need to pass the
window object, so I'm going to

172
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,080
pass that content window, and
it looks about right.

173
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,890
And, cool.

174
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,120
So we actually just changed the
context of what Firebug is

175
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,340
looking at, and now I can type
secret, get my answer.

176
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,880
So I'm querying the Javascript
that's going on inside of

177
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,330
here, and to return back to the
outer context, I just do

178
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,000
cd(top), and I'm back
where I started.

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,940
That's about it.

180
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,530
All right, so I would definitely
recommend checking

181
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,890
out the DevTools website, where
there's a bunch more

182
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,490
docs on all this stuff, if
you're interested in digging

183
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,450
and learning more.

184
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,700
All right, thanks.

185
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,653
