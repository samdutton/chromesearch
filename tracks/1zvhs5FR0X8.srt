1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,041

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,460
COLT MCANLIS: Better yet, I use
Chrome OS, because I don't

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,110
know what defrag is.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,746
NOEL ALLEN: There you are.

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,090
COLT MCANLIS: There
is actually.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,340
NOEL ALLEN: Ooh.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,550

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,860
COLT MCANLIS: All right.

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,490
It looks like we are alive.

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,260
Fantastic.

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,700
Hello.

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,520
Welcome, everyone.

13
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:24,830
Wow.

14
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,830
We have a post-lunch
coma crowd.

15
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,970
Hello, everyone!

16
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,890
AUDIENCE: Hello!

17
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,700
COLT MCANLIS: Fantastic.

18
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,050
Perfect.

19
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,860
Guys, we're getting recorded on
YouTube, and you're going

20
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,490
to be like, no, let's not
talk to the presenter.

21
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,340
That's horrible.

22
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,960
Your voice will be recorded
and saved for

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,230
the annals of time.

24
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,780
Anyhow, hello everyone.

25
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,340
Welcome today to Native
Client Live.

26
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,460
My name is Colt McAnlis.

27
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,910
I'm a developer advocate
at Google

28
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,160
working on Native Client.

29
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,155
NOEL ALLEN: I'm Noel Allen,
the SDK lead.

30
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:51,140
COLT MCANLIS: SDK lead.

31
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,240
And we have fancy
hats, as well.

32
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,370
We figured these lights
are actually

33
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,220
pretty gnarly up here.

34
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,940
We can't see people.

35
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,130
So we're like, let's
wear our hats.

36
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,235
That'll be funny.

37
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:01,505
NOEL ALLEN: It actually kind
of works, because it is a

38
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:02,870
little bright.

39
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,650
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

40
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,900
So what today's talk is about
is, we're actually going to

41
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,980
port an application to Native
Client live in 60 minutes.

42
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,690
Now, just quick show of hands
in here, how many have

43
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,920
actually played with
Native Client?

44
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,370
Wow.

45
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,590
That's actually a surprising
amount of people.

46
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,210
I'm very encouraged
by that, actually.

47
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,930
They'll know what we're
talking about today.

48
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,910
Funny story is we actually
decided to sign off to do this

49
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,030
about three to four
months ago.

50
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,120
And we actually walked into
Noel's office, and I was like,

51
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,020
hey, we're going to give a talk
at Google I/O, and we're

52
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,220
going to port something
to Native

53
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,610
Client live in 60 minutes.

54
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,280
And he was like, uh,
no you're not.

55
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,240
And I said, yes, yes we are.

56
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,570
So we got him to
sign off on it.

57
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,790
I convinced him with alcohol
or something else.

58
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,920
And we started going through
the process.

59
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,870
And the truth was, we failed.

60
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,900
We failed a lot.

61
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,620
Horribly.

62
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,350
Like crash and burn style.

63
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,990
NOEL ALLEN: You failed
before I started.

64
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,310
Let's just get that clear.

65
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,040
COLT MCANLIS: Fair enough,
fair enough.

66
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,420
That is true.

67
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,030
The original port of the
application we're going to

68
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,160
show you today actually took
about 2.5 weeks the very first

69
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,310
time we did it, which was kind
of embarrassing on our side,

70
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,920
because it's a very simple
piece of technology we're

71
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,290
going to look at today.

72
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,060
But the good news is that we
actually learned from that.

73
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,940
We said, where are we.

74
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,100
This isn't good for
our developers.

75
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,440
Let's improve the process.

76
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,690
Let's improve the SDK,
the workflow.

77
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,630
And what we're going to talk
about today is the learn-ins,

78
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,110
the learn-ins of those things.

79
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,880
So how you should view
today's class session

80
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,490
is a cooking show.

81
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,750
How many people watch
late night cooking?

82
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,300
Really?

83
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,390
That's it?

84
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,930
The rest of you are liars, and
you're dirty, filthy liars.

85
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,530
If you do not watch
Iron Chef there is

86
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,380
something wrong with you.

87
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,630
That is an amazing show.

88
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,340

89
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,730
When did &mdash;

90
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,945
OK &mdash;

91
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,580
NOEL ALLEN: You kept changing
the slides on me.

92
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,770
I figured I'd have
some fun too.

93
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,690
COLT MCANLIS: That's new.

94
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,280
OK.

95
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,950
We're going there.

96
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,090
Today is a cooking show,
and we have Chef

97
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,240
Noel Allen over here.

98
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,320
In these shows, you usually have
some very peppy person

99
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,010
standing up there showing you
how they're going to make a

100
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,640
lamb sorbet, which is normally
like a nine-day endeavor.

101
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,210
And they're going to do it in 30
minutes and show you how to

102
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,710
do it, too.

103
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,380
Well, we're going to do the
same process today.

104
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,080
We're going to take the
knowledge and everything we've

105
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,700
learned in the past couple of
months and dissect it down.

106
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,400
Now, we've had to pre-chop some
onions so that we can get

107
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,120
this in our 60 minute window
here, but we'll be sure to

108
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,360
call that out so you know what
was pre-chopped, what was

109
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,750
canned, and what was actually
fresh tuna fish

110
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,080
for our lamb sorbet.

111
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,655
And that hat is awesome.

112
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,040
Where did you even find that?

113
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,080
NOEL ALLEN: I got
it at the store.

114
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,240
COLT MCANLIS: You have two?

115
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,093
Sweet.

116
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:30,550
Sorry, guys.

117
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,005
I'm getting fired.

118
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,950
This is going to be awesome.

119
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,430
How does it look?

120
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,130
NOEL ALLEN: Very nice.

121
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,690
Very convincing.

122
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,680
COLT MCANLIS: I feel like
I have a pope hat.

123
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,470
Is this even on right?

124
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,770
NOEL ALLEN: I can't tell.

125
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,630
I don't know what it's supposed
to look like.

126
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,450
COLT MCANLIS: OK, cool.

127
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:43,950
All right.

128
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,780
We're wearing these now.

129
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,330
Fantastic.

130
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,860
I'm sure the YouTube
guys love this.

131
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,520
OK.

132
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,460
This is a cooking show
with your chefs.

133
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,770
So let's get started and talk
about Native Client a little

134
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,435
bit, sort of set the groundwork
and the ecosystem

135
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:55,660
of we're talking about today.

136
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,380
Native Client is a technology
that allows you to run C and

137
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,040
C++ code in a web page with the
same safety as JavaScript.

138
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,320
And here's the really cool part,
is that the user is not

139
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,620
required to install a plug-in.

140
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,160
So what we've seen is that with
a lot of technologies out

141
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,310
there, you can actually run C
and C++ code in a web browser,

142
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,529
but the user gets this really
scary pop-up that's like, hey,

143
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:19,980
you're about to install a
plug-in that's going to

144
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,970
violate every piece of data you
have on your hard drive.

145
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,580
What we've been seeing over time
is that that, of course,

146
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,445
affects user retention rates.

147
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:28,620
NOEL ALLEN: And installation.

148
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,330
COLT MCANLIS: Say again?

149
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,990
NOEL ALLEN: And installation.

150
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,600
COLT MCANLIS: And installation.

151
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,220
Exactly.

152
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,070
So users get there, and they
go, hey, this is too scary.

153
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,900
And they move on.

154
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,980
And so this means that high
performance applications that

155
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,810
want to run C++ code in a web
page really lose a lot of

156
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,620
their users to this
scary dialogue.

157
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,660
Now, with Native Client, C++
and the fact it can be run

158
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,560
safely in the web browser and
they're not prompted to

159
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,750
install a plug-in, means that
your C++ code can actually

160
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,070
bridge a lot of ecosystems
and a lot of platforms.

161
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,000
So predominantly, C++ code was
in the realm of game consoles,

162
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,330
PC development mobile.

163
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,960
And now you can actually use
your same code base right in

164
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,250
the web, which is fantastic
for a lot of companies and

165
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,470
studios who spend a lot of time
not only training their

166
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,530
engineers in C++ code, but also,
you have legacy code.

167
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,540
You've got 10 years of C++
memory management code, STL

168
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,340
containers sitting around,
and you don't want to

169
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,690
throw all that out.

170
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,190
Now, we had our official Native
Client launch event in

171
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,860
December of last year.

172
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,160
In truth, Native Client was out
for quite a while before

173
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,510
that, but we decided to snazzy
it up and actually have some

174
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,330
hors d'oeuvres and call
it a launch event.

175
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,500
Since then, NaCl has been
doing fantastic.

176
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,580
We've seen already 27 titles,
actual products, ship with

177
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,770
Native Client since
the announcement.

178
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,000
In addition to that, we've
seen that game developers

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,750
predominantly love
Native Client.

180
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,880
We see a lot of technology
middleware for games on the

181
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,640
side there.

182
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,500
They're finding that Native
Client provides them this nice

183
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,480
little niche between performance
and reach.

184
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,360
You can run all of your code
extremely fast and reach all

185
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,200
of the 310 million users
that Chrome has active.

186
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,000
That was a new stat today.

187
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,210
Watch the keynote.

188
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,740
So let's talk about what
we're cooking today.

189
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,790
Let's switch this over to you.

190
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,550
So Chef Noel, can you show us
what our lamb sorbet looks

191
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:13,870
like today?

192
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,380
NOEL ALLEN: Absolutely.

193
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:21,540
So for today, we have a fabulous
spinning cube.

194
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,170
COLT MCANLIS: That wasn't what
we looked at yesterday.

195
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,435
What &mdash;

196
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,480
NOEL ALLEN: Well, we still had
a couple, you know, bugs.

197
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,650
Issues.

198
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,080
COLT MCANLIS: You didn't
fix the bugs?

199
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,750
We were supposed to have &mdash;

200
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,610
you were buying the hats.

201
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,390
NOEL ALLEN: I was busy.

202
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,010
I had stuff to do.

203
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,430
I had a new Nexus
to play with.

204
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,770
COLT MCANLIS: Fair enough.

205
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,120
Cool.

206
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,640
You had a new Nexus.

207
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,970
Awesome.

208
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,810
So we're doing a
spinning cube.

209
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,560
So what is this thing actually
doing behind the scenes?

210
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,180
NOEL ALLEN: OK.

211
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,260
So this is an open GL demo.

212
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,900
It's a kind of standard demo
that you do, make sure your

213
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,730
graphics engine is rendering
correctly, hence the arrows

214
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,430
and the lighting and whatnot.

215
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,870
So this is a standard Windows
32 application.

216
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,340
And we're going to port
that to Native Client.

217
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,860
COLT MCANLIS: And so this is
doing just standard rendering.

218
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,550
So we're [? reading ?] in some
shaders, reading some

219
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,170
textures, doing some
a platform calls.

220
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,820
NOEL ALLEN: Exactly.

221
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,060
COLT MCANLIS: This is
our lamb sorbet.

222
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,170
Fantastic.

223
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,050
So with that spinning cube up
and running over there to

224
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,950
distract all of you, I'm going
to point over this way with

225
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,700
sock puppets.

226
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,050
Let's talk about our kitchen.

227
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,880
Let's talk about what
development with Native Client

228
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,010
should actually look like
today for most of you.

229
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,140
So, when porting to Native
Client, you need to approach

230
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,010
it from the concept of
any other ports.

231
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,370
So let's say you're actually
porting an application from

232
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,160
Windows to Linux.

233
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,620
This is going to have a specific
set of processes that

234
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,000
you're going to need
to go through.

235
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,420
First off, you're going to need
to actually change over

236
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,110
from using DirectX to OpenGL.

237
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,360
That's actually a big set of
code, different APIs that

238
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,410
aren't available on the
Linux machines.

239
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,560
Also some APIs are only
available on Windows for the

240
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,280
same process.

241
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,800
So you want to spawn
up a thread.

242
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,230
Well on Windows, you'd use
beginthread or beginthreadex.

243
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,570
On Linux, you would have to use
sort of a more POSIX style

244
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,050
pthread_create.

245
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,590
And for other things, Windows
actually provides a very rich

246
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,950
ecosystem for UI components that
you can use as part of

247
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,850
their platform that may
not exist on other

248
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,600
platforms like Linux.

249
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,170
So instead of being able to
actually use the message box

250
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,040
function directly, you'd have to
get shifted over to printf.

251
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,820
Right?

252
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,020
So viewing your port to Native
Client should be the same way.

253
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,620
You should view it like porting
from anything to

254
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,370
another platform.

255
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,400
But with Native Client, what
you're actually porting to are

256
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,310
these specific functions.

257
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,410
You're actually porting to
an API we call Pepper.

258
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,960
Now, what Pepper is, is it's
actually a plug-in API that

259
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,630
Chrome provides that allows
plug-ins to interact with

260
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,380
lower-level system resources
like FileIO, rendering, audio,

261
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,710
and even the ability to
communicate directly to the

262
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,690
JavaScript page.

263
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,480
And it allows it to do this
inside of the Chrome sandbox,

264
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,630
which means that these
plug-ins are actually

265
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,039
communicating through the same
exact code paths that

266
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,210
JavaScript is communicating
to, to do the same

267
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,390
functionality.

268
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,240
This hat is awesome,
by the way.

269
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,710
I'm not sure &mdash;

270
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,950
I need an ear-in.

271
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,470
It's popping over my head.

272
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,100
Anyhow, Native Client should be
viewed as a plug-in that's

273
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,970
provided with Chrome.

274
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,030
It's compiled with Chrome.

275
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,260
It's shipped with Chrome.

276
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,540
And what Native Client allows
you to do is it allows you to

277
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,290
load pre-compiled executable
code that can then target the

278
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,880
Pepper APIs.

279
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,080
It'll load it up, execute the
code, and allow that code to

280
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,340
actually, directly trampoline
over and get access to these

281
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,630
lower-level system resources.

282
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,400
How this works at a developer
level starts with the

283
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,100
original C++ code.

284
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,310
The C++ code is then sent
through our custom GCC

285
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,260
compiler, provided by the SDK.

286
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,880
This spits out a set
of NEXE files, or

287
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,470
Native Client exe files.

288
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,100
These have been munged
and messed

289
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,510
around a bit to ensure &mdash;

290
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,870
well, to do the best we
can to ensure safety.

291
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,700
We remove a lot of malicious
codes that may cause security

292
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,940
vulnerabilities and some other
fun stuff that we'll talk

293
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,520
about later.

294
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,170
You take this data that's
actually generated from the

295
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,870
toolchain, and with a simple
HTML embed tag, you can

296
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,810
actually get it running right
in your web page.

297
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,380
So what you're actually seeing
on the screen there is a

298
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,690
screenshot from a game
called From Dust.

299
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,130
From Dust was actually an Xbox
360 title that was ported over

300
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,390
to Native Client that we
unveiled earlier this year.

301
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,000
Now, this is running the same
shaders, the same code.

302
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,910
It's actually doing
quite amazing.

303
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,272
I think I have this backwards.

304
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:00,694
How about that?

305
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:01,540
Is that better?

306
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,030
NOEL ALLEN: You're going to
fiddle with this the whole

307
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,325
presentation, aren't you?

308
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:04,390
COLT MCANLIS: It's
annoying me.

309
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,060
My head's too small and
my ears are too big.

310
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,760
That's the problem.

311
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,370
So let's talk a little
bit about the SDK.

312
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,530
The SDK itself allows for cross
platform development on

313
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,190
platforms for Linux,
Windows and Mac.

314
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,360
And we do this through providing
a simple command

315
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,710
line GCC compiler.

316
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,880
So the compiler itself is just
simple command line.

317
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,130
Everybody in here has probably
used GCC at one time in your

318
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,270
programming life.

319
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,395
We also provide a full set of
working code examples so that

320
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:29,600
you can actually see how to
properly use Pepper and how to

321
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,950
use Native Client and
best practices

322
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,550
involved with that process.

323
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,530
And then in addition to that, we
also provide debugging and

324
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,110
profiling tools that
are currently an

325
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,380
AlphaRev of our SDK.

326
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,430
Now, this takes a little
bit to understand.

327
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,310
So you need to know that when
we generate these Native

328
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,810
Client executables, the NEXE
files, it's not your

329
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,915
standard x86 code.

330
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,590
We've got a lot of paperwork
that we're not going to talk

331
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,150
about today so much.

332
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,220
It actually isn't an exe that
you can just double click on

333
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,360
your desktop and run.

334
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,740
It's actually a modified
DWARF file.

335
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,130
Right?

336
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,470
NOEL ALLEN: Correct.

337
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:01,940
DWARF and ELF.

338
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,460
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

339
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,010
Fantastic.

340
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,480
Which means that debugging
systems work a little bit

341
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,130
differently.

342
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,670
You don't have a PDB file
full of symbols and

343
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,400
all these other things.

344
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,040
It requires some massaging.

345
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,820
Now with these things in mind,
let's talk about actually

346
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,970
porting, because we've only
got 47 minutes left.

347
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,850
And my hat is funny.

348
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,070
And I'm running on
reserve power.

349
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,320
This isn't even plugged in.

350
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,330

351
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,000
If it was a perfect demo,
we wouldn't do it.

352
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,730
So here's our plan
of attack today.

353
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,222
First, what we're going to do
is we're actually going to

354
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,120
build as a Pepper
plug-in first.

355
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,890
Pepper's a fantastic API, but
we're going to actually ignore

356
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,950
the Native Client part of the
equation and just migrate over

357
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,580
our platform-specific APIs over
to the Pepper APIs first.

358
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,430
And then as a last step, we'll
actually do the generation of

359
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,840
the Native Client exe.

360
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,170
This allows us to actually use
our plug-in system in an

361
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,970
existing IDE of choice.

362
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,910
So standard plug-in development
is pretty much

363
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,900
exposed in every
IDE out there.

364
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,650
It's a standard loop.

365
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,970
You create a DLL or an SO.

366
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,540
The external application
loads it up.

367
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,170
You can set break points,
see memory, all

368
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,280
this other fun stuff.

369
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,290
Now to facilitate this, and
this is one of the biggest

370
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,490
things that we learned in our
failures that I mentioned

371
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,820
earlier in this project, was
that we really didn't have

372
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,470
good integration into
existing IDEs at the

373
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,680
level we wanted to.

374
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
So today we're actually really
excited to announce that we're

375
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
actually providing a Visual
Studio 2010 plug-in for Native

376
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,920
Client and Pepper.

377
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,430
And we'll actually
provide this &mdash;

378
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,700
Please.

379
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,830
Yes, applause.

380
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,170
Yeah.

381
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,130
That's cool.

382
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,120
Add-ins are awesome.

383
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,250
This will be available
in the Pepper 22 SDK.

384
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,430
So if you guys go to GoNaCl.com,
grab the SDK

385
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,610
chain, you'll actually
get a preview.

386
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,890
Because we actually
have a few Peppers

387
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,330
ahead of stable available.

388
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,630
Right?

389
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,700
Canary builds and
the other stuff.

390
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:38,850
NOEL ALLEN: Yes.

391
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,910
COLT MCANLIS: So this is
actually available, and you

392
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,800
guys can totally take
a look at it.

393
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,540
So we're really excited about
that, because it really helps

394
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,710
with ease of use.

395
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,770
Now, what chef Noel is going
to do today for us, can you

396
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,220
walk us through some of the
things that the add-in does

397
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,790
inside of Visual Studio?

398
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,630
NOEL ALLEN: Sure.

399
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,390
Absolutely.

400
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,190
So I have already created some
different configurations.

401
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,180
We can see a Native Client
configuration, a Pepper

402
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,340
configuration, and the
original Windows 32

403
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,760
configuration.

404
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,105
So what the add-in is doing is
we can go over here and &mdash;

405
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:13,880

406
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
so the add-in drives
the compiler.

407
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Now for the Pepper
configuration, it's actually

408
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,640
pretty straightforward.

409
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,570
All we're actually going to
do is convert from an

410
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,080
executable to a DLL.

411
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,290
So Chrome's going to load this
and run it as a plug-in.

412
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,420
Very little change.

413
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,420
I'm just going to go ahead and
point my Include Directories

414
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,310
to the Pepper SDK.

415
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,690
I'm going to create a macro for
Pepper so that I know in

416
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,260
my code which particular view
of the code I'm looking at.

417
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,450
And that's pretty much it.

418
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,170
I'm ready to go.

419
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,720
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

420
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,270
Fantastic.

421
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,550
So you set up these properties,
so you create the

422
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,880
platform, and then
you compile.

423
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,620
And what happens here?

424
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,180
NOEL ALLEN: Right.

425
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,820
So now I'm going to switch to
the Pepper configuration, and

426
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,180
I'm going to go ahead
and re-launch.

427
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,360
Now, I did actually do one other
thing, which is for the

428
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,850
sake of debugging, I set this
up to launch Chrome for me.

429
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,470
COLT MCANLIS: Oh.

430
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,840
Now, I see some other
flags in there.

431
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,800
Can you walk us through what
exactly is going on?

432
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,200
NOEL ALLEN: Sure.

433
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,260
So there's a couple flags in
here that make things a little

434
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,560
bit easier for you.

435
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,980
So I am setting user data
dir to not pollute

436
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,490
my normal user settings.

437
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,270
I have Incognito to let Chrome
forget what I've done, so we

438
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,720
don't actually get
caching effects.

439
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,240
And then, register
Pepper plug-in.

440
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,860
Here's the interesting one where
I am telling Chrome,

441
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,490
please load this plug-in, and
then I want you to answer any

442
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,790
request to the particular MIME
type I have described here,

443
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,260
which in this case is
application xNaCl.

444
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,010
COLT MCANLIS: Interesting.

445
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,110
So to be very clear about this,
what happens is, any

446
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,240
time Chrome actually encounters
the MIME type

447
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,710
application NaCl, it'll actually
go load the Native

448
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,200
Client exe and pass the
data over to it.

449
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,310
What this command line option
allows us to do is override

450
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:51,970
that process.

451
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,320
And so instead of actually
finding MIME type NaCl and

452
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,090
running NaCl, it's going to
run our plug-in instead.

453
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,980
NOEL ALLEN: Exactly.

454
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,860
So we can go ahead
and launch that.

455
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,910

456
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,240
And it helps if I start
the web server first.

457
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,200
Always useful.

458
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,920
All right.

459
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,086
Now, it couldn't find
the plug-in.

460
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:20,060
COLT MCANLIS: So why is it
saying that, though?

461
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,940
NOEL ALLEN: Well, I am missing
the components that let Pepper

462
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,210
talk to the plug-in.

463
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,050
COLT MCANLIS: I see.

464
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,160
So we had our Win32 codes.

465
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,420
So even though we've compiled it
as a DLL, we haven't added

466
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,670
the hooks, the API hooks,
for Pepper for

467
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,340
Chrome to actually load.

468
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:32,785
NOEL ALLEN: Exactly.

469
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:33,940
COLT MCANLIS: So where
do we get those, and

470
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,680
how do we get those?

471
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:34,970
NOEL ALLEN: OK.

472
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,450
Well, the easiest thing to do is
I am just going to sit here

473
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,510
and go over to one of the
examples that we ship, and

474
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,810
just copy and paste it in,
so that I have all

475
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,640
that start-up code.

476
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,590
COLT MCANLIS: I like
your style.

477
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,430
What is that they say?

478
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,182
That good programmers code and
great programmers reuse?

479
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,330
I like it.

480
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,110
NOEL ALLEN: So if we take this
Hello World example, And I'm

481
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:00,680
going to select that, and paste
it here into the bottom,

482
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,930
and then run again.

483
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,610

484
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,640
So now we can see the Hello
World demo that

485
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,930
ships with the SDK.

486
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,665
COLT MCANLIS: And then that's
running in our existing code?

487
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:11,440
NOEL ALLEN: Correct.

488
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,320
COLT MCANLIS: So, but where'd
the spinning cube go?

489
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,650
NOEL ALLEN: Well, we haven't
called it yet.

490
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,560
So we haven't actually called
any of the original

491
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,565
code that we had.

492
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:18,330
COLT MCANLIS: Can you?

493
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,480
NOEL ALLEN: I can do
that real quick.

494
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:19,690
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

495
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,552
You do that.

496
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:21,802
Awesome.

497
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:23,926

498
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:24,700
NOEL ALLEN: OK.

499
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,830
So if I come up here
and just say &mdash;

500
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,500

501
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,050
COLT MCANLIS: Now, really quick
while you're scrolling

502
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,920
up here, what are these
functions we're looking at?

503
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,950
These are Pepper functions,
right?

504
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,920
NOEL ALLEN: So these are
Pepper functions.

505
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,450
So as I said, there's three
functions that we look at.

506
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,560
We have a module initialization,
we have an API

507
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,350
request, and we have a
shut down function.

508
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,930

509
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,740
One of the APIs that gets
requested is an

510
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,740
API for your interface.

511
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,600
So you're going to provide
functions that Chrome can call

512
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,220
into to do things.

513
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,890
And one of those is this Did
Create, which is very similar

514
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,700
to the regular Main function.

515
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,369
So from there I'm actually
going to call into the

516
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,619
original WinMain.

517
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,579

518
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,110
And now we've got our
box, but no alert.

519
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,990
COLT MCANLIS: Interesting.

520
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,380
OK, so what we're seeing here
though is really cool, because

521
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,660
we're actually seeing Win32 code
running side by side as

522
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,150
launched from a plug-in
inside of Chrome.

523
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,310
So now we can call this code,
because we're actually running

524
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,170
on a Windows system.

525
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,890
NOEL ALLEN: Exactly.

526
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,210
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

527
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,000
So the goal here is to actually
get that spinning

528
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,960
cube running in the web page.

529
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,310
So we've got all that
stuff set up.

530
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,810
The next step for us is to
actually port over to Pepper.

531
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,490
Now, when understanding the
Pepper API, it's important to

532
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,030
understand how an application
communicates with a plug-in to

533
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,340
kind of give a little
bit more visibility

534
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,350
into what it's doing.

535
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,290
So let's say we've got our
Chrome, and let's say we've

536
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,180
got our plug-in.

537
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,430
Chrome, of course, will call
init, like it did.

538
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,350
And then the plug-in will
go do some processing.

539
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,880
Now, in order for the plug-in
to get a sort of persistent

540
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,560
heartbeat &mdash;

541
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,780
right, because this
is a plug-in.

542
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,250
We can't just allow yourself
to go call code into it,

543
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,290
otherwise you'll never
receive execution

544
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,980
control back into Chrome.

545
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,840
So once the plug-in's done, it
can actually tell Chrome, hey,

546
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,170
can you call me again in
10 minutes, or whenever

547
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,320
you get some time.

548
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,460
And so what'll happen is
the plug-in, and Pepper

549
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,800
specifically, provides APIs
that allow you to push a

550
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,560
callback up into Chrome.

551
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,280
And then Chrome can run off, do
some processing, render a

552
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,910
web page, check your local
listings for cars and salty

553
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,090
pork products.

554
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,310
And then when it gets around
to it, it can actually call

555
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,570
that callback, giving execution

556
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,790
control back your plug-in.

557
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,390
And then of course, your plug-in
does some processing

558
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,440
and the cycle repeats.

559
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,280
And this is as close as you
can get actually having a

560
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,910
while loop inside of Pepper
or inside of a plug-in.

561
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,020
We allow you to get this
processing over time.

562
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,040
Now, let's talk about a couple
road blocks you're going to

563
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,260
run into when working
with Pepper.

564
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,430
First off, all of the APIs for
Pepper are non-blocking.

565
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,460
And you can see why
when looking at it

566
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,970
as a plug-in API.

567
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,660
If one of these APIs were
blocking, what would occur is

568
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,850
that you can effectively stall
out all of Chrome, because

569
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,990
execution control goes into
the plug-in and then they,

570
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,680
Chrome, won't get any more time
slices to give to v8 or

571
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,280
anything else.

572
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,810
And so you get that nice,
little aw snap

573
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,430
little sad face dude.

574
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,540
My heart always breaks
when I see him.

575
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,210
I'm like, aw, he's so sad.

576
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,650
Don't worry, the internet
is still there.

577
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,670
Anyhow, second off is that
Pepper APIs can only be called

578
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,360
from the main thread.

579
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,110
This is another restriction
that we enforce to ensure

580
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,880
stability and security
over time.

581
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,470
And then finally, that there's
really no main loop in Pepper.

582
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,240
As you can see, based upon the
APIs, that you can't actually

583
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,590
just create a while loop
and sit there and spin.

584
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,820
Now, I want to point out that
this is sort of temporary

585
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,550
restrictions as of Pepper 21.

586
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,520
The team is working very, very
hard at removing these

587
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,630
restrictions, including the
ability to call Pepper from

588
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,340
any thread in your environment,
which would be a

589
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,130
huge step forward for those of
you who've done development.

590
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,980
So let's talk about the call
loop a little bit more, and

591
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,060
why exactly we didn't
see the plug-in, but

592
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,180
we did see the cube.

593
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,960
So what exactly happened was
this, Chrome called init and

594
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,950
gave execution control
to the plug-in.

595
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,990
Well, the plug-in at that point
actually called into

596
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,940
Windows and said, hey,
let's go run this.

597
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,620
Now, Windows being Windows code
effectively sucked up all

598
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,690
of the processing time.

599
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,790
And we actually didn't ever give
execution control back

600
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,950
into Chrome.

601
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,090
So WinMain has a little while
loop in there where it

602
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,310
processes events and message
pumps and everything else that

603
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,410
it passes to the window.

604
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,500
And we were never actually
able to give

605
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,470
control back into Chrome.

606
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,900
So we starved it out.

607
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,200
But you guys didn't see the aw
snap sad face, because we

608
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,360
didn't hit the time out
period for the demo.

609
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Our floppy hats kept
us from doing that.

610
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,500
So in order to fix this though,
Chef Noel, Chef

611
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,535
Noelington III, can you show us
how you address this issue?

612
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:36,150
NOEL ALLEN: OK.

613
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,670
So here are a couple of changes
that I'm making.

614
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,140
So we want to break that main
loop into two separate pieces,

615
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,440
the initialization piece
and the actual loop.

616
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,620
So I am going to ifdef out the
loop and instead put it in a

617
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,410
new function.

618
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,580
And I'm going to have that
function request to get more

619
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,740
execution time by asking Pepper,
please call on the

620
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,350
main thread this function
again at a later time.

621
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,580
COLT MCANLIS: And so this is the
function that effectively

622
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,330
pushes the function pointer
back into Chrome.

623
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,176
NOEL ALLEN: Correct.

624
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:07,610
COLT MCANLIS: Excellent.

625
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,810
So then, what's this
look like?

626
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,267
NOEL ALLEN: Well, let's
fire that up.

627
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:14,249

628
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:16,750
COLT MCANLIS: So we get the pop
up and we get the cube.

629
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,760
So the execution happened
side by side.

630
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,670
Fantastic.

631
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,090
So now that that's handled and
we know that we're actually

632
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,540
not stalling out Chrome and we
have execution control being

633
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,650
handed back to the main
application, let's actually

634
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,180
talk about loading files.

635
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,140
Now, Native Client is an
internet technology, which

636
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,490
means that it's served from a
web server somewhere and the

637
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,820
client is going to make a
request to pull things down.

638
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,275
Now, any time you have
communication between client

639
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:40,180
and server with a web browser &mdash;
we'll talk about

640
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,010
Chrome just to limit our scope
of discussion here &mdash;

641
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,420
when a page load request
occurs, Chrome, on your

642
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,740
behalf, will go ahead and fetch
specific files and store

643
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,780
them in Chrome's cache.

644
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,140
Which means it'll grab HTML
files, it'll grab NEXE files

645
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,560
and the Native Client Manifest
file, the NMF file.

646
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,980
Now, this'll be stored
in the cache on your

647
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,850
behalf, which is fantastic.

648
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,500
Because if you have executable
code sitting on a server

649
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,060
somewhere, it's probably
between the

650
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,200
range of 5 to 13 megabytes.

651
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,000
And you don't want the user to
have to keep grabbing that

652
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,270
code and pulling it down every
time they hit refresh.

653
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,610
Now, the bad part about this,
though, is that Chrome won't

654
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,730
go fetch all of those other
files which are usually

655
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,120
required by your application.

656
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,340
You've usually got a bunch
of binary data.

657
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,780
If you're a game developer,
you've got textures, assets,

658
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,870
map data, XML information, all
this other sort of stuff.

659
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,340
Now, to grab that data &mdash;

660
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,290
that's specifically what we're
going to focus on today &mdash;

661
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,460
Pepper provides an API
called GetURL.

662
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,140
GetURL, again being an internet
technology, says,

663
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,800
hey, here's a URL, go fetch
me the bits of this.

664
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
So in JavaScript, this would
be equivalent to

665
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,950
an XHR, XHTTP request.

666
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,740
So everyone in here is
a net developer.

667
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,370
You should grock that.

668
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,240
I see one head nodding.

669
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,250
I like your style.

670
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,250
Can I nod with this and
that actually work?

671
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:51,980
Maybe.

672
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,110
Everyone on YouTube
just jumped.

673
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,850
Cool.

674
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,920
In addition to that, because
you can actually pull down

675
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,890
this data, again, that's not
cached on your behalf.

676
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,320
So you actually have to have
an answer for that.

677
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,150
Because, again, if the user
reloads your page, you're

678
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,290
going to have to go grab another
40 megs worth of data

679
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,580
every time they do that.

680
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,810
To address this, Pepper actually
provides another API

681
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,210
called the FileStore API.

682
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,300
So you can actually grab your
data and write it to the

683
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,770
Persistent Sandbox file
storage on disk.

684
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,370
This way, when the user closes
Chrome, reloads the page, goes

685
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,150
on vacation for 15 days, that
data will still stay on disk

686
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,900
that you can pick up
and grab later.

687
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,670
So this is a great place
to put save state, user

688
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,230
preferences that you may not
want to sync to the cloud, or

689
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,040
just, again, the 80 megs of
binary data that's needed for

690
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,860
your application.

691
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,100
Now, one thing we talked about
earlier was that the Pepper

692
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
APIs are non-blocking.

693
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,980
So for all of you who have used
fread, we can't use that

694
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,950
in Native Client, because that
would actually stall the

695
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,310
system, wouldn't relinquish
control back to Chrome.

696
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,880
So we actually don't allow
you to use that command.

697
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,650
You have to use GetURL.

698
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,840
And any of you who have done
asynchronous file loading know

699
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,990
what this looks like.

700
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,560
Effectively, we have
an init phase.

701
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,260
The init phase will kick off an
open URL command to Chrome

702
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,530
and say, hey, go
load some data.

703
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,490
Then our plug-in will actually
go into a loader loop phase.

704
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,230
What we're going to do is we're

705
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,390
effectively going to spin &mdash;

706
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,095
well, we can't exactly spin, but
we're going to go through

707
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:13,820
a process of allowing Chrome to
do call on main thread and

708
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,080
allowing the plug-in to
relinquish control, gain

709
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,830
control, et cetera, et cetera,
until Chrome actually tells us

710
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,540
the file has actually
been opened.

711
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,270
Chrome will signal to us and
give us a specific call.

712
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,490
Once we've received the file
open command, we then can

713
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,690
issue a read bytes and say, hey,
you've opened the file.

714
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,340
Please give me some data.

715
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,320
And then we can continue this
loop until the data's actually

716
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,980
been fetched.

717
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,740
And this is the standard loader
loop that we're going

718
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,700
to work through here.

719
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,650
Once the data's been fetched or
pre-loaded everything, you

720
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,540
can then move on to your actual
render loop and start

721
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,650
drawing the cube
on the screen.

722
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,870
So you haven't seen that
one yet, have you?

723
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,050
NOEL ALLEN: You know I'm
allergic to fish.

724
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,040
COLT MCANLIS: Really?

725
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,960
That makes it even awesomer.

726
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,050
NOEL ALLEN: I'm going to itch.

727
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,620
COLT MCANLIS: So by the way,
don't Google man hugging fish.

728
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,400
Different sort of results
that you get there.

729
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,680
Anyhow, your royal majesty
Noelington Chefton III, can

730
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,050
you please walk us through what
this FileIO asynchronous

731
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,120
stuff looks like in our demo.

732
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,790
NOEL ALLEN: Sure.

733
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:16,700
So what we're going to do is
we are going to request for

734
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,960
these assets to get loaded
in the background.

735
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,020
And we're going to do that by
first issuing an Open, as you

736
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:30,160
described, which is basically
a Get request to the asset.

737
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,690
Once that open completes, it's
going to call us back.

738
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,870
And then in that callback
function, we're going to

739
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,580
record the size of the object
that we're getting, we're

740
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,050
going to allocate memory for
it, and then we're going to

741
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,910
start reading bites.

742
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,490
And again, this happens
as a callback.

743
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,920
So every time we get some bites
back, we're then going

744
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,770
to call this other function,
which is going to store it in

745
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,660
that block of memory
that I allocated.

746
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,340
And eventually, when I get
enough of it, I'm going to go

747
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,300
ahead and give myself a
call back to let me

748
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,410
know that it's there.

749
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,200
And when it's there, I'm simply
going to increment a

750
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,650
global counter that says, hey,
I got another asset.

751
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,400
COLT MCANLIS: Now, to be very
clear, we know that all of you

752
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,630
have very sophisticated code
bases, and asynchronous file

753
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,340
loading is probably part of your
general platform library.

754
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,310
We are not at all advocating
this as best practices for

755
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,390
loading files on the internet.

756
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,150
Please write a good asset
manager with mutexes and

757
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,540
callbacks and everything else.

758
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,410
Don't just use a counter.

759
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,290
That's really just a bad idea.

760
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:26,420
Sorry.

761
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,160
I had to give the disclaimer,
otherwise it'll show up like,

762
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,380
Google says you should just use
a counter to load all of

763
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,445
your files with Native Client.

764
00:26:32,445 --> 00:26:32,940
NOEL ALLEN: Yes.

765
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,650
Well the ugly counter hack
is, in fact, right here.

766
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,480
We're going to call the
initialization programs.

767
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,600
I've changed this main loop.

768
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,010
So we do the initialization.

769
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,870
And then once we actually
discover three assets, then

770
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,720
we're going to switch
to rendering.

771
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,120
But in either case, we're just
going to go back and ask for

772
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,640
more processing time
every time we go

773
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,830
through the loop as normal.

774
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,470
COLT MCANLIS: So effectively,
if we haven't loaded it yet,

775
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,540
we still submit our call on
main thread so we can get

776
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,770
processing in the future to
determine if it's all loaded?

777
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,100
NOEL ALLEN: Correct.

778
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,030
COLT MCANLIS: And then once the
things are loaded, we go

779
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,670
to our render loop
at that point.

780
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:04,930
NOEL ALLEN: Exactly.

781
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,830
COLT MCANLIS: And so
this has changed.

782
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,080
Let's see this live.

783
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,936

784
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:12,740
NOEL ALLEN: OK.

785
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,040
So it looks much the same.

786
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,360
But if we go over here and look
at the web server, you

787
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,045
can see that originally
we were getting &mdash;

788
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:24,290
hold on.

789
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,540
Ran the wrong file.

790
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,206

791
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:29,190
COLT MCANLIS: Stop it.

792
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,740
Stop it all.

793
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,015
Hit buttons.

794
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,050
NOEL ALLEN: Please stop.

795
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,510
COLT MCANLIS: Click more.

796
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,140
Panic click.

797
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,100
Panic click.

798
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,290
Take evasive action.

799
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,113
Scatter.

800
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,560
NOEL ALLEN: You're not
being helpful.

801
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,290
COLT MCANLIS: I know.

802
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,060
NOEL ALLEN: I want you to know,

803
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,980
you're not being helpful.

804
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,640
So as we can see here, we now
actually see the requests for

805
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,010
those assets coming into
the web server.

806
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,640
So we have successfully moved
over to serving the

807
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,410
data from the web.

808
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,110
COLT MCANLIS: Awesome.

809
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,560
So as a Pepper plug-in, we were
actually able to just use

810
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,210
fread and actually
load the data.

811
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,030
But as part of the Pepper API,
you can see that we're

812
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,270
fetching it right
from the server.

813
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,180
You need to nod with
authority.

814
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,615
NOEL ALLEN: Is my hat
not correctly &mdash;

815
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:07,230
COLT MCANLIS: Well, you have
hair, and so it keeps it from

816
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:07,785
sliding around.

817
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:11,480
That my problem, is
the balding thing.

818
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,290
So once we've got a rendering
with our simple example, the

819
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,080
next step is actually to get us
porting from OpenGL, which

820
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,560
is desktop GL, to GLES2, which
is the API that we provide in

821
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,810
Native Client that allows you to
do fancy rendering of cube

822
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,450
with arrow texture.

823
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,020
I really think we should have
done the other demo.

824
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,420
You should have fixed stuff
instead of playing with your

825
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,440
new hardware.

826
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,320
So what we're going to do today
is we're not going to

827
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,470
talk about the actual porting
process of GL to GLES.

828
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,350
There's a lot of documentation
out there on how to actually

829
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,350
do this process.

830
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,090
GLES2.0 is very dominant on
mobile devices right now.

831
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,530
And if you just Google
for &mdash; don't Google

832
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,500
for man hugs fish.

833
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,890
Instead, Google for desktop GL2,
GLES2, you'll find much

834
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,980
more useful information
in that process.

835
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,990
We are going to note a couple
things that are different

836
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,610
between the two.

837
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,150
Just so if you've never
actually dealt with

838
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,770
OpenGLES2.0, you're aware of
some of the things you're

839
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,510
going to run into
moving forward.

840
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,230
First off, they are not
the same thing.

841
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,160
The predominant one is that
GLES2 could be considered a

842
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,480
subset of GL.

843
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,040
The most shocking change there
is that GLES2.0 has no fixed

844
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,960
function of support.

845
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,310
So in order to draw a polygon or
set some state or even get

846
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,080
a texture on screen, you have to
provide a vertex shader and

847
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,070
a pixel shader.

848
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,470
If you've never written a
vertex shader or a pixel

849
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,460
shader, don't worry.

850
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,680
The internet can help you.

851
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,610
Which I find I need on
my business card.

852
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:21,980
Don't worry.

853
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,250
The internet can help you.

854
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,300
In addition to that, there's
a different shader syntax.

855
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,080
When you actually do write your
shader for the system,

856
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,310
because standard GL does support
shaders, the syntax

857
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,370
itself is different.

858
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,730
So you have to set different
precision values for your

859
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,550
pixel shaders, as well as some
other nuances with how you

860
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:43,060
handle skinning and constant
register access.

861
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,540
And probably one of the
interesting things is because

862
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,280
GLES2.0 is actually a subset of
GL, some things that you'd

863
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,360
normally have to go to GL and
fetch extensions for you no

864
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,340
longer have to.

865
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,430
So with standard desktop GL, you
would have to go grab an

866
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,610
extension to actually do
multiple render targets or to

867
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,220
do deferred rendering or some
other interesting things.

868
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,710
With GLES2, a lot of that
stuff is just provided

869
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,160
natively, which is fantastic.

870
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,070
There is one API we're going to
talk about today, though.

871
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,060
And this is really the only
thing that's Pepper specific

872
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,100
in the translation
from GL to GLES.

873
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,670
And that is a function
called SwapBuffers.

874
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,900
So what happens is, when you're
doing your render loop

875
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,410
you're going to render some
polygons, you're going to set

876
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,460
some textures, blow up some
aliens, do really cool stuff.

877
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,550
From there, you're actually
going to call

878
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,980
the SwapBuffers API.

879
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,730
Now typically, what SwapBuffers
will do with the

880
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,370
GL API is it'll actually trigger
off a command to the

881
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,820
device driver and to the GPU to
swap the front screen with

882
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,500
the back screen.

883
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,920
So when you actually do your
rendering, all of the commands

884
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,640
are actually compositing to a
buffer that's not currently

885
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,950
displayed to the user.

886
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,410
And the swap screen command
tells it to say, hey, swap it

887
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,650
so the user can see the work
that you've all done.

888
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,300
The SwapBuffers command provided
with Pepper, part of

889
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,150
our header suite, actually
contains a function that

890
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,220
allows you to actually kick
off your callback.

891
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,020
So typically, like we said
before, you're going to need

892
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,160
to use a call on main thread so
that sometime in the future

893
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,650
you'll get called again.

894
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,050
The SwapBuffers API sort of
encapsulates these two

895
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,720
concepts into a single call.

896
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,100
So you can actually kick off
your SwapBuffer call as well

897
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,950
as push your function pointer
back into Chrome.

898
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,840
Now, if you're doing rendering,
you should consider

899
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,450
this the end of your
Pepper frame.

900
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,520
Because if you've called
SwapBuffers it's time to

901
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,420
relinquish control
off to Chrome.

902
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,650
Chrome's going to do some cool
stuff, fix the internet, make

903
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,020
everything amazing, and
do it really fast.

904
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,710
And then eventually it'll come
back and call your function,

905
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,840
because you've passed it off.

906
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,260
And that's your start
of your frame again.

907
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,270
So this is really the
only difference.

908
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,100
Everything else is a standard
GL to GLES port.

909
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,680
This is the one thing you
need to be aware of.

910
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,900
So we're not talking
about GL to GLES.

911
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,270
So this is the chopped onions
part of the talk.

912
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,890
We're not going to walk you
through that change.

913
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,080
We've already got it live.

914
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,965
Can you show us what
that looks like?

915
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:56,240
NOEL ALLEN: Sure thing.

916
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,600
So here is the change that we
discussed, the SwapBuffer.

917
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,350
And I am going to go
ahead and run this.

918
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:09,070

919
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,110
COLT MCANLIS: Very cool.

920
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,790
So we're actually running
in the web page.

921
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,360
NOEL ALLEN: We now have our
cube in the web page.

922
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,720
COLT MCANLIS: Very cool.

923
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,170
I like that.

924
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,590
So now, quick question here.

925
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,010
If we actually are creating a
Pepper plug-in, and we can

926
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,840
actually get it to run in the
web page like this and do full

927
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,900
graphics and high precision
timing and everything, why are

928
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,320
we even messing with NaCl?

929
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,150
Why don't we just ship
a Pepper plug-in

930
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,130
and that's our product?

931
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,880
NOEL ALLEN: Well first, Chrome
isn't going to let you just

932
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,570
load some random plug-in.

933
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,070
Native code is kind of an ugly,
unsafe thing, so we want

934
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,350
to make sure that we take
care of it correctly.

935
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,470
So in order to use that C and
C++ code, you're going to want

936
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,320
to ship that as a NEXE so that
you get that extra protection.

937
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,000
COLT MCANLIS: So you're saying
that me downloading an

938
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,820
arbitrary plug-in from Bob's
hugging fish website is not

939
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,740
necessarily a safe
thing to do?

940
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,100
NOEL ALLEN: Yes.

941
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,250
Especially not the websites
you go to.

942
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,780
COLT MCANLIS: Let's edit that
part out of YouTube, please.

943
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,730
So the next step then, since
we actually don't want to

944
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,790
provide just a plug-in to the
masses, because, again,

945
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,510
that'll come back to the point,
the user will get that

946
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,440
really nasty pop-up that says,
hey, Bob's Hugging Fish

947
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,080
Basement would really
like to install some

948
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,070
things on your computer.

949
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,170
Which, never click OK to that.

950
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,950
What we're going to do now is
we're actually going to do the

951
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,030
final step of our process of
creating our lamb sorbet and

952
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,970
actually go and compile our
code with Native Client,

953
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,400
generating the proper NEXE files
that can be distributed

954
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,380
on the internet.

955
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,310
So now, recall this graph here
is that Native Client is a

956
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,770
plug-in that's provided with
Chrome that allows external

957
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,460
compiled code to effectively
call the APIs that allow

958
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,730
secure sandbox execution to
lower-level system resources.

959
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,160
Now, the add-in for Visual
Studio provides some specific

960
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,780
nuances that we should
talk about here.

961
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,700
What the Visual Studio plug-in
does at this point in time,

962
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,100
because debugging and profiling
support is still in

963
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,720
alpha, the add-in actually
doesn't allow you to set break

964
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,820
points and do debugging inside
of Native Client.

965
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,500
Yet.

966
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,440
That's coming soon.

967
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,480
Stay tuned.

968
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,100
Follow me on G+.

969
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,510
What it does now though is
it'll actually scrape the

970
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,270
Visual Studio properties on
your behalf and create the

971
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,730
proper command line that's
required to send off to GCC.

972
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,250
GCC, of course, will then
produce the NEXE from our SDK

973
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,719
and then output any information
for command line

974
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,130
errors or processes back
to Visual Studio.

975
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,699
So the good thing is if you are
a Visual Studio developer,

976
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,060
you've got a lot of legacy code
there, this allows you to

977
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,800
operate and compile with Native
Client in a way that

978
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,210
feels very natural to you, save
for the break points and

979
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:33,690
the debugging.

980
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,780
But again, that's in alpha.

981
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,830
We're working very
hard on that.

982
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,130
Right, Noel?

983
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:36,889
NOEL ALLEN: Exactly.

984
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,670
COLT MCANLIS: Noel's actually
the guy heading that up.

985
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:38,900
Right?

986
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,230
NOEL ALLEN: Yes.

987
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,964
COLT MCANLIS: Your hat is
heading that up, actually.

988
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:42,719
NOEL ALLEN: My hat
is in charge.

989
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,444
COLT MCANLIS: Your hat is
in charge of debugging.

990
00:34:44,444 --> 00:34:45,300
It's still floppy.

991
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,550
I don't know what to do.

992
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,870

993
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,600
Anyhow, this is actually my
favorite picture in the deck,

994
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:51,969
by the way.

995
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,100
NOEL ALLEN: Thanks.

996
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,590
COLT MCANLIS: It's
the salt head.

997
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,520
We did a rehearsal of this a
couple weeks ago, and someone

998
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,900
said, you should probably
Photoshop some

999
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,880
salt shakers in there.

1000
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,880
And I was like, well,
here's a salt head.

1001
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,100
So part of our add-in allows
the Pepper configuration as

1002
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,290
well as the NaCl
configuration.

1003
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,540
So can you show us the NaCl
config and what it does?

1004
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,750
NOEL ALLEN: Absolutely.

1005
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,040
OK.

1006
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,960
So again from the add-in that
you'll get in Pepper 22, you

1007
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,280
can go ahead and set up for a
Native Client configuration.

1008
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,810
And as Colt said, this is
going to drive that GCC

1009
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,740
toolchain for you.

1010
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,060
And then we have the
standard settings.

1011
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,250
Again, I'm going to use Chrome
as the application that I'm

1012
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,200
actually going to run.

1013
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,740
And I am going to set some
additional flags.

1014
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,690
I'm going to set my include
directories.

1015
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,490
I'm going to set my
library paths.

1016
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,090
All the standard things
that you would set

1017
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,520
for using an SDK.

1018
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,995
And we can take a
look at that.

1019
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:56,360
COLT MCANLIS: So now, once you
create the configuration is

1020
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,890
there anything else?

1021
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,280
Or can we actually
just run live?

1022
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,675
Will it do a lot of automation
for you?

1023
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:01,680
NOEL ALLEN: Well, what'll end
up happening is if we try to

1024
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,190
run it right now, we still have
that Windows window and

1025
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,870
some other stuff that
we need to clean up.

1026
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,260
So we'd actually get a lot of
compile errors or link errors

1027
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,170
or whatnot.

1028
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,505
So we still have to get rid of
those platform specific things

1029
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,615
to Windows.

1030
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:15,710
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

1031
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,440
Let's take a look at that.

1032
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,788
Or at least, can you point
them out or make

1033
00:36:17,788 --> 00:36:17,904
[? the right ?]

1034
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:18,020
change, or &mdash;

1035
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,660
NOEL ALLEN: Sure.

1036
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,240
So let me show you the changes
that we had to do here.

1037
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,080
So we need to obviously no
longer include the Windows

1038
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,350
header, because that's
not going to work,

1039
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,080
or the Windows libraries.

1040
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,500
We need to stop calling main,
because that had a lot of

1041
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,190
Windows code in it.

1042
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,670
So instead, we just call the

1043
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,770
initialization function directly.

1044
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:43,550
And we need to no longer use
those old GL calls and things

1045
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,810
that were pointing to screen
resolution and things like

1046
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,240
that that were described
in Windows, so

1047
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,930
basically the WGL calls.

1048
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,235
COLT MCANLIS: Got it.

1049
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:55,290
NOEL ALLEN: So once those have
all been ifdeffed out, then

1050
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,095
we're actually ready to
make that change.

1051
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:57,410
COLT MCANLIS: Cool.

1052
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,440
So we've converted all of our
stuff over to Pepper.

1053
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,040
So we're using those
API calls.

1054
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,230
We've also removed any platform
specific code from

1055
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,670
our application at this point.

1056
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,490
That's the good thing.

1057
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,210
And so now we can
actually run--?

1058
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:09,760
NOEL ALLEN: OK.

1059
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,690
So this is the Pepper version.

1060
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,660
And now I'm going to switch to
the Native Client version.

1061
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,080
Rebuild, and you can see in
the output window the

1062
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,910
toolchain running.

1063
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,660
And now we have the cube
actually running as a Native

1064
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,290
Client module.

1065
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,330
COLT MCANLIS: Fantastic.

1066
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,850
Perfect.

1067
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,740
That's cool.

1068
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,110
NOEL ALLEN: And you can
see the load is

1069
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,350
right here of the NEXE.

1070
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,290
COLT MCANLIS: Excellent.

1071
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:36,770
Excellent.

1072
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,120
So now with the Visual
Studio plug-in &mdash;

1073
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,080
because we want to empower
developers to do great

1074
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,630
things &mdash; you can actually swap
back and run the original

1075
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,870
Win32 as well still.

1076
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,150
Right?

1077
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,250
NOEL ALLEN: Exactly.

1078
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,360
So the Windows 32 version
is still available.

1079
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,760
So I will switch back to that.

1080
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,560

1081
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,390
And here we are.

1082
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,640
COLT MCANLIS: Really?

1083
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,630

1084
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,760
You honestly went to my G+
stream and pulled down a

1085
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,870
picture of me eating barbecue
in Austin, Texas?

1086
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,690
NOEL ALLEN: You put
it up there.

1087
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,935
Anybody can get access to it.

1088
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:12,330
What do you want?

1089
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,270
COLT MCANLIS: There's
a great &mdash;

1090
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,100
you didn't do this yesterday.

1091
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,750
OK.

1092
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,170
Awesome.

1093
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,390
That's a great barbecue place
in Austin, Texas.

1094
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,750
I highly recommend
you going to it.

1095
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,290

1096
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,970
Stop going to my G+ page.

1097
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,785
I'm going to put you in
a separate Circle.

1098
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:30,100
You don't get any access
to photos.

1099
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,590
I lost myself.

1100
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,260
What are we talking about?

1101
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,970
OK.

1102
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,410
Win32.

1103
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,830
So this is the original
Win32 application.

1104
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,100
Fantastic.

1105
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,810
OK.

1106
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,940
It's mesmerizing.

1107
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,030
NOEL ALLEN: Actually,
I find it a

1108
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,332
little disturbing, myself.

1109
00:38:43,332 --> 00:38:45,260
COLT MCANLIS: I'm very
disturbed right now.

1110
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,200
So, fantastic.

1111
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,100
So we've done the port.

1112
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,130
We actually have, according to
that timer back there, we've

1113
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,280
got 20 minutes left.

1114
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,270
So even with me blathering on
about all this other stuff

1115
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,730
about Native Client, we've been
able to chop some onions,

1116
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,760
dice some things up.

1117
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,810
The power of the Visual Studio
add-in actually propelled us

1118
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,670
to do a lot of these things &mdash;

1119
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,770
do it in a faster manner.

1120
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,170
A lot of the heavy lifting
was done by the add-in.

1121
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,780
Pepper was really the hard place
that we had to do some

1122
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,810
API conversions.

1123
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,020
Now, what we didn't talk about
today was anything under the

1124
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,260
hood of Native Client.

1125
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,430
Today's talk has been
specifically focusing on the

1126
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,980
developer side of things.

1127
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,920
Now, if you're interested in
what Native Client is doing

1128
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,880
under the hood, to make sure
that you can run native code

1129
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,430
in a browser with the same
security and safety as

1130
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,930
JavaScript, I highly recommend
you check out Nick Bray's talk

1131
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,880
on Life of Native Client
Instruction.

1132
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,340
It's happening today, in fact.

1133
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,690
He is actually going to pull
back the mask of running x86

1134
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,970
code in the web and talk about
all the bad things it can do

1135
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,910
and how Native Client addresses
those issues.

1136
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,650
So I highly recommend checking
out his talk.

1137
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,690
So what did we learn today?

1138
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,730
Let's talk about this,
the leftovers.

1139
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,450
So develop as a Pepper
plug-in first.

1140
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,160
This is going to allow you
to use your existing IDE.

1141
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,280
It's going to allow you to
develop as a plug-in, which a

1142
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,670
lot of developers are
familiar with.

1143
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,690
And it's going to allow you to
use the debugger properly.

1144
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,840
Now, again you can use debugging
and profiling with

1145
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,830
Native Client, but they're
very alpha right now.

1146
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,050
So if you're used to using
Visual Studio all the time,

1147
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,570
you're probably going to have
a lot of teeth gnashing in

1148
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,210
that process.

1149
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,560
Instead, use your IDE, get
everything ported over to

1150
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,020
Pepper, make your big
code changes there.

1151
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,630
Never underestimate the power
of a good platform wrapper.

1152
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:18,860
Right?

1153
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,560
Because all the platform code
that effectively you're using

1154
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,200
for Pepper, you should properly
abstract out.

1155
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,805
So when you're about to jump in
the code and be like, I'm

1156
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:28,300
going to do Native Client,
stop, hammer

1157
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,410
time, think about it.

1158
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,680
And then write a good wrapper
so you can actually maintain

1159
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,610
your backward compatibility to
the other [? SKUs ?] that

1160
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,840
you're targeting.

1161
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,160
We ported FileIO.

1162
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,140
We ported GL to GLES.

1163
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,760
And then we remove all of our
platform specific stuff from

1164
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,910
NaCl, and we did it with really
cool looking hats.

1165
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,020
I'm still amazed you
found these.

1166
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,450
And with that, we're
done with the port.

1167
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,130
I'm Colt McAnlis.

1168
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:50,935
NOEL ALLEN: I'm Noel Allen.

1169
00:40:50,935 --> 00:40:52,800
COLT MCANLIS: That's porting
in 60 minutes.

1170
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,080
And we'll open the floor for
some questions right now.

1171
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,816

1172
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:01,690
You did good.

1173
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,740
I don't know if I
should curtsy.

1174
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,200
NOEL ALLEN: I don't
do that funny bow.

1175
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,100
I'd probably just
fall right over.

1176
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,960
COLT MCANLIS: Probably.

1177
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,900
We're a little bit top heavy.

1178
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,010
So there's some microphones
here.

1179
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,630
If you've got some questions,
please feel free to speak up.

1180
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,430
Yes, sir.

1181
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,490
No, the guy behind you.

1182
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,885
No, I'm just messing with you.

1183
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:15,360
Sorry.

1184
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,566
The hat, it gives me power.

1185
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:20,320
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
there are any plans to be able

1186
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,550
to target Pepper to native
binaries so that I could use

1187
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,770
the same APIs for deploying to
NaCl and to deploying to just

1188
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,690
an application running on
there and not have that,

1189
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,695
ifdeffed out Win32 code.

1190
00:41:33,695 --> 00:41:35,730
COLT MCANLIS: That's actually
a great question.

1191
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,510
I'm going to let
you field this.

1192
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,250
NOEL ALLEN: Actually, could
you repeat that again?

1193
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,790
I'm not sure exactly what
you were asking there.

1194
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,530
Can you take a binary that's
already compiled?

1195
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,290
AUDIENCE: So no.

1196
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,780
So the question is you've been
porting the app to use these

1197
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,550
Pepper APIs instead of using
the native Windows APIs.

1198
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:56,320
Is there any plans to create
kind of a wrapper that is the

1199
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,420
Pepper API but it targets
Windows functions instead of

1200
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,010
the Chrome functions?

1201
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,990
COLT MCANLIS: So we could use
fread, and under the hood it

1202
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,850
would do the right
Pepper thing.

1203
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,170
AUDIENCE: Right.

1204
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,270
NOEL ALLEN: Gotcha.

1205
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:04,690
Yes.

1206
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,490
So actually, there's some stuff
already out there that

1207
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,150
other people have developed.

1208
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,990
But we are actually putting in
a subset of that into the SDK

1209
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,090
as we speak.

1210
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,970
So you can expect to see things
like pthread wrappers,

1211
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:24,570
access to fread open, closed,
the standard POSIX-y things,

1212
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:28,830
except running in Win32 so that
you can take that Native

1213
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,940
Client application and then run
it as a Pepper plug-in so

1214
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,400
that you can do your
development

1215
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,650
a little bit easier.

1216
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,650

1217
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,760
AUDIENCE: So the question I have
is about the transition

1218
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,340
from the no sandbox
to the sandbox.

1219
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,330
So basically, obviously, since
you are using Windows calls,

1220
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:49,730
you used the no sandbox call
initially when you just made

1221
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,370
it a Pepper plug-in.

1222
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,950
So where does the transition
happen?

1223
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:59,030
So when you actually make it a
NEXE and when you download it,

1224
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,610
is it that the MIME type is
handled by the Native Client?

1225
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,190

1226
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,780
Where does the transition
to the sandbox happen?

1227
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,770
When you ran it finally,
did you also

1228
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,610
run it with no sandbox?

1229
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:10,600
NOEL ALLEN: OK.

1230
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,820
So what the no sandbox does
is it takes out that

1231
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,850
outer Chrome sandbox.

1232
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:16,895
AUDIENCE: I know what
no sandbox does.

1233
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:18,232
NOEL ALLEN: I was just
explaining it

1234
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:19,060
for everybody else.

1235
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,450
COLT MCANLIS: There's a lot of
other people in the room who

1236
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,235
may not know.

1237
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:25,410
NOEL ALLEN: But what that outer
sandbox does is it gives

1238
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,880
you that OS protection.

1239
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,750
So it interferes with things
like debugging.

1240
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,160
So I have the no sandbox off to
enable me to debug at every

1241
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,020
single step.

1242
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,130
Now, when you actually deploy
it &mdash; so if I took this

1243
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,734
application, I can switch it
back to Native Client.

1244
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:42,490
Go over here to Properties,
Debugging.

1245
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,050
And as you can see,
I do not have No

1246
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,720
Sandbox set at this point.

1247
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,780
So I'm actually running it
with the sandbox on.

1248
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,530
AUDIENCE: Right.

1249
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,180
So that was my question.

1250
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,720
So how does this actually
work in the sense that &mdash;

1251
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,675
so when the page actually loads,
does it have a MIME

1252
00:43:57,675 --> 00:44:01,140
type that is whatever
application slash xNaCl, and

1253
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,715
that's handled by whatever the
NaCl processor inside Chrome?

1254
00:44:04,715 --> 00:44:05,320
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

1255
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,390
So remember early on in the
talk, we talked about using

1256
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,840
the embed tag to actually
signify and point to the

1257
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,810
Native Client manifest.

1258
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,510
And we defined the
MIME type there.

1259
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:15,690
And then, when the page is
parsed by Chrome, it'll say,

1260
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,690
hey, we found this MIME type.

1261
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,240
And it has a table that says,
load this plug-in to handle

1262
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,080
this MIME type.

1263
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,400
NOEL ALLEN: Correct.

1264
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,230
So, the application xNaCl
typically points to the Native

1265
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,610
Client plug-in.

1266
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,140
But we were overwriting that for
the purpose of developing

1267
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,690
as a Pepper plug-in
to make it easier.

1268
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,305
COLT MCANLIS: We were
hacking the planet.

1269
00:44:36,305 --> 00:44:36,925
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

1270
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,175
COLT MCANLIS: No problem.

1271
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:43,268

1272
00:44:43,268 --> 00:44:46,920
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
there's plans to get this in

1273
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,190
the mobile version of Chrome.

1274
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,440
And if so, when?

1275
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,742

1276
00:44:52,742 --> 00:44:54,310
NOEL ALLEN: I actually
don't know.

1277
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,952
I'll leave that to you.

1278
00:44:57,952 --> 00:45:00,840
COLT MCANLIS: Next question.

1279
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,310
I've got no answers
for you today.

1280
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,540
I'm sorry.

1281
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,730
AUDIENCE: Then maybe &mdash;

1282
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,450
the NEXE format very
specific to x86.

1283
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,560
Or is it something like LLVM
that might be able to be

1284
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,540
compiled for an ARM?

1285
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,620
NOEL ALLEN: So let me rephrase
that question.

1286
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:22,330
So what you're looking at right
now is specifically an

1287
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:26,920
x86, 64-bit binary that was
generated by the toolchains.

1288
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,440
OK?

1289
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,830
So if someone had a 32-bit
version of the browser, then

1290
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,700
they would be using the
32-bit version.

1291
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,250
Or if they had an ARM, they'd
be using the ARM version.

1292
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,540
Now, we are working on a
portable version that will, in

1293
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,690
fact, use LLVM to generate
bitcode.

1294
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,240
And then we will do
the translation at

1295
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,870
the browser for you.

1296
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,750
So you can expect that to be
coming around like, say, end

1297
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,640
of the year.

1298
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,358
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1299
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:55,810
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

1300
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,340
If I have a pretty sophisticated
Pepper plug-in

1301
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,130
already made &mdash;

1302
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,230
Well, I guess my question is do
I have full access to all

1303
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,746
the Pepper APIs inside NaCl,
or is it some subset?

1304
00:46:06,746 --> 00:46:13,510
NOEL ALLEN: It is a subset,
but it's almost all.

1305
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:18,780
So there's a few private
interfaces that are only

1306
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,580
usable by a few different
plug-ins.

1307
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,220
So unless you were one of those
special cases already,

1308
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,886
you wouldn't have had
access to it.

1309
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:27,260
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

1310
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,122

1311
00:46:30,122 --> 00:46:33,320
AUDIENCE: I noticed you took
out two of the libs.

1312
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,130
If I have an external lib,
I need to recompile

1313
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,510
that lib as a NaCl.

1314
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:39,210
Is that correct?

1315
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,080
And then statically link it?

1316
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,145
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

1317
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:41,760
NOEL ALLEN: Yes.

1318
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,180
So you're asking what
do you have to do

1319
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:45,920
with the two libraries.

1320
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,520
So the libraries that we see
here, that I took out, is the

1321
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,600
Windows GL libraries.

1322
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,470
Since we're GLES, you're
going to be using GLES.

1323
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:02,520
Now, as you can see here, what
I'm doing is I am loading the

1324
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,220
PPAPI version of the
GLES2 library.

1325
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,050
So you will get this in the
SDK in the native form for

1326
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:11,690
your platform.

1327
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,350
So Windows, Mac, Linux.

1328
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,680
And of course, the
GCC toolchain

1329
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,630
ships with it as well.

1330
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,140
So you'll have it on
all the platforms.

1331
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,450
And we do actually ship the
source for this library.

1332
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,266
So you could actually recompile
it yourself, if you

1333
00:47:25,266 --> 00:47:25,710
wanted to as well.

1334
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,880
COLT MCANLIS: And If you have
libraries, you do have to

1335
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,540
recompile them, because
otherwise it may have unsafe

1336
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,660
code or it may use fread or try
to open a window and that

1337
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,670
would, of course, fail
the validation.

1338
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,660
AUDIENCE: I'm sure there's
an example I can follow.

1339
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,810
That sounds great.

1340
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:45,380
The other question was, now that
Chrome is in Android 4.1,

1341
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,175
is Native Client also runnable
through that Chrome version?

1342
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:53,200
COLT MCANLIS: I believe the
correct answer is no.

1343
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,170
Because remember Chrome on
Android doesn't have all of

1344
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,910
the big wizbang features
today.

1345
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,470
We want to, of course, as
Chrome, move towards having

1346
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,680
feature parity in as many
places as we do.

1347
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,930
Right now, we actually
don't have Native

1348
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:04,760
Client running on Chrome.

1349
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,090
NOEL ALLEN: Yes.

1350
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,860
Currently, this is
a desktop only &mdash;

1351
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,060
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

1352
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,310
Currently desktop only.

1353
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,710

1354
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,500
Fantastic.

1355
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,800
Going once, going twice.

1356
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,740
Thank you, guys, for your
attention today.

1357
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,390
We appreciate it.

1358
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,640
Thank you.

1359
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,033
