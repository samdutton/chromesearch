1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,670
ANNA PATTERSON: My dad was a
NASA engineer, so he brought

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,030
us for a tour at Johnson Space
Center, and they asked my

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,440
brother what he wanted to be,
and he said an astronaut.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,780
And then they asked me
what I wanted to be,

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,200
and I said an astronaut.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,260
And they said, what?

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,020
Girls can't be astronauts.

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,050
In their mind, they
were right.

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,564
They just didn't realize that
the future would be different.

11
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:26,650

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,920
GAYATHRI RAJAN: It's hard
when you're young,

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,210
when you're a teenager.

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,220
There's a lot of peer
pressure to conform.

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,420
ANGELA LAI: There is a certain
stigmatism to being a woman in

16
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:34,890
technology.

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,210
It doesn't seem to be something
that you do.

18
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,010
JEN FITZPATRICK: I didn't want
to be stuck at my desk,

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,360
programming on a computer 8, 10
hours a day, every day for

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,070
the rest of my life.

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,730
That's just not how
I saw myself.

22
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,160
But so much of it is also
collaborating with other

23
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,790
people, and brainstorming,
and problem solving.

24
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,590
GAYATHRI RAJAN: It's
working as a team.

25
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,200
It's building things together.

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,600
ANGELA LAI: It always
feels like play.

27
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,560
It doesn't feel like work.

28
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,900
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I'm always
surprised that there are not

29
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,620
more women going into tech,
because I think it's growing,

30
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,180
and there are just lots
of opportunities.

31
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,170
ANGELA LAI: There is no road
blocks, you know, being a

32
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,170
woman in technology.

33
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,410
PAVNI DIWANJI: There were
a lot of naysayers.

34
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,930
They're like, don't do that.

35
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,720
You're never going
to be successful.

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,630
And so one of the things I
learned very quickly is you've

37
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,030
got to stay focused, and you
just have to believe in

38
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,360
yourself and just
make it happen.

39
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,700
GAYATHRI RAJAN: I come into work
everyday excited about

40
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,200
the challenges and the
possibilities.

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,460
JEN FITZPATRICK: It's incredibly
satisfying to know

42
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,730
that you're doing something that
has that type of impact

43
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,145
and that type of reach.

44
00:01:31,145 --> 00:01:32,200
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: You really
feel like you're doing

45
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,080
something that's helpful and
that's making a difference.

46
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,160
PAVNI DIWANJI: I'm able to
create something that most

47
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,920
universities in the world use.

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,820
You know, how impactful
is that?

49
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,630
GAYATHRI RAJAN: Five million
businesses use the products

50
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,740
that I've been working on.

51
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,490
ANNA PATTERSON: Every time
you type in a query,

52
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,920
you're using my code.

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,100
And that means that
I'm reaching

54
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,520
billions of people a day.

55
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,670
JEN FITZPATRICK: You see the
impact every single day on

56
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,880
real people, and your friends,
and your family, and that's

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,235
just magical.

58
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:16,030

59
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,160
MEGAN SMITH: Hello, welcome to
Women Techmakers live on

60
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,110
location at Google I/O. It's
incredible to be here.

61
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,160
We have a fabulous lineup
of speakers.

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,760
We've set up this session as a
series of lightning talks.

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,560
So we want to ignite and inspire
with topics around

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,980
search, of course, but also
Google Glass, some product

65
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,990
insights, AI knowledge,
and other topics.

66
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,440
I've asked all of our speakers
to tell personal stories as

67
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,720
they walk through these topics,
and we have a bit of a

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,420
theme of past, present,
and future.

69
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,615
But before we start, I don't
know if my slide thing is

70
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:53,340
advancing, so I'm going
to come over here.

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,010
Hello?

72
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,220
Sorry, guys &mdash; there.

73
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,520
So this is the lineup.

74
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,910
And before we start, I want to
talk a little bit about why we

75
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,010
started Women Techmakers.

76
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,700
Last night we had a fabulous
gathering of the women, a

77
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,370
pre-gathering of the women who
are here at I/O. And we might

78
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,290
be in the minority,
but we're fierce.

79
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,660
And it was really fun, a good
social experience, and we want

80
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,060
to build community amongst
women, with our male

81
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,810
colleagues.

82
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,190
We also are working on
visibility, and women are

83
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,350
largely invisible in technology

84
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,440
is part of our feeling.

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,080
And so our goal is to
increase visibility.

86
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,330
Our industry is probably 10 or
20% technical women, sometimes

87
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,240
a little higher.

88
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,100
We want to get to 50%.

89
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,780
We want to match
the population.

90
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,300
Products are just better
when they're

91
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,360
built by diverse teams.

92
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,520
Companies are better.

93
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,750
The world is better.

94
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,550
And that's part of our goal.

95
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,400
I wanted to give a shout out
to real progress that's

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,790
happening this year.

97
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,392
Sheryl Sandberg, who is a
fabulous colleague, Google

98
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:56,160
alum now, leading Facebook with
Mark, has really driven

99
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,380
the national and international
conversation up.

100
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,320
We need to be talking
about these things.

101
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,380
I don't know if people
are familiar

102
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,040
with the Maker series.

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,410
Maker.com, AOL, and PBS
have launched this.

104
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,080
It's the modern women's rights
movement's history,

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,100
documentaries, and really
shining a light into actual

106
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,930
fabulous stories, the back
stories, on women that you

107
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,380
haven't really heard before.

108
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,250
And you just saw a video clip,
a montage of something we've

109
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,490
done, which is called Makers at
Google down here, which you

110
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,150
can get to on
google.com/diversity/women.

111
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,960
We really want people to know
the stories of the women who

112
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,390
build YouTube, the women who
build Android, the women who

113
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,790
build Search.

114
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,950
And so we've launched this
series starting today.

115
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,510
As part of celebrating what's
going on and some momentum, we

116
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,810
have a long way still to go, but
we've come a long way in

117
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,600
really upping the
conversation.

118
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,430
I just want to shout out to some
of the giants we stand on

119
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,440
the shoulders of.

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,460
This is Katherine Switzer, first
woman to run the Boston

121
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,055
Marathon officially.

122
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,770
I encourage you to
watch her story.

123
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,170
The race director tried to
rip her numbers off.

124
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,900
It's on Makers.com.

125
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,180
And this is Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, and she's delivering

126
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,820
the Declaration of Sentiments in
the mid 1800s at the first

127
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,070
Women's Rights Convention back
when women weren't allowed to

128
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,730
go to university and were not
allowed to do many things.

129
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,740
How many people in this room
have ever heard of the

130
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,430
Declaration of Sentiments?

131
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,130
There's one, two.

132
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,945
Looks like for people on
Livestream, we're probably at

133
00:05:17,945 --> 00:05:22,300
about 10%, which brings me to
the point I want to make,

134
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,880
again, about visibility
and invisibility.

135
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,020
We really have a problem
with how visible

136
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,170
technical women are.

137
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,360
And so I want to jump into two
things before we start.

138
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,780
Sometimes you're lucky &mdash; you
know, there's symptoms of a

139
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,930
problem, and sometimes there's
roots of a problem.

140
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,350
And I stumbled off across this
when I met Geena Davis, the

141
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,170
famous Academy Award-winning
actress.

142
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,990
Geena was watching TV with her
children when they were young

143
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,420
and she just &mdash; as an
actress, she could

144
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,320
see that TV was biased.

145
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,630
And she'd say in the industry,
there's not enough women and

146
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,010
girls on children's
television.

147
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,680
People would say, yes, of
course, there's plenty, like

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,570
Dora, the "Scooby-Doo" girls,
lots of people.

149
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,570
But then she thought,
no, there's not.

150
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,830
Let's measure.

151
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,170
You manage what you measure.

152
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,620
So she measured it together with
USC Annenberg, and the

153
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,620
studies were showing &mdash; and
they had grad students

154
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,080
counting by hand &mdash;

155
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,810
it's actually three to one
across all of children's

156
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,610
television, the corpus of
children's television of men

157
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,240
and boys versus girls.

158
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,850
And so the girls aren't equally
represented, and you

159
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,720
see amazing things that you
wouldn't even notice, but how

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,180
many women in the whole ocean
in the film "Nemo"?

161
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,900
How many monsters or muppets
were in "Sesame Street" who

162
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,880
were girls until the '90s?

163
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,770
That would be zero.

164
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,123
"Nemo"?

165
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:38,080
One.

166
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,450
So we're not accurately
depicting the world, and we're

167
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,960
skewing it.

168
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,920
So one of things we've been
lucky to do &mdash; and also, one

169
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,340
more stat, the 80% stat.

170
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,740
80% of the jobs that were held
by characters in the

171
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,410
television our children watched,
were held by male

172
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,400
characters.

173
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,690
So we taught our kids that girls
and women don't do STEM,

174
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,175
which it just doesn't happen to
be true, as we'll show in

175
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:00,070
this session.

176
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,110
And so we really need
to get in here.

177
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,920
We are now working with Geena on
trying to automate some of

178
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,620
this so we could have a gender
disparity measurement ability

179
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,660
to look at our media.

180
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,010
And I encourage everybody who
has technical background, look

181
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,310
at ways we could use technology
to count bias so we

182
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,030
can measure and see things.

183
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,140
The last thing I'll point out
before we start about things &mdash;

184
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,000
oh, one more example.

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,670
This is so insidious, like our
bias, that I was looking in a

186
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,180
catalog recently, and this was
a dresser for a boy and a

187
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,600
dresser for a girl.

188
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,380
And the colors are different,
but really, the big difference

189
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,960
to me that I saw because of
being aware of Geena's work

190
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,140
was that the boy got
the microscope

191
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,340
and the girl didn't.

192
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,840
So as you now know this fact,
you're going to notice it

193
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,540
everywhere.

194
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,830
And it's something we
need to work on.

195
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,010
And if we could use technology
to help ourselves see it, we

196
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,150
could get out of this historic
bias that we inherited.

197
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,310
The last thing I would say
before we start is around

198
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,380
becoming visible, includes not
only seeing the technical

199
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,620
women who are here today, but
also the historic women.

200
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,700
I don't know how many people
recognize some of the people

201
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,090
on these slides.

202
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,370
Yeah, I see a couple hands,
but really probably these

203
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,990
people are pretty
unknown to you.

204
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,915
Ada Lovelace is representing
the Doodle.

205
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:09,940
She's from 1800s.

206
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,000
She's actually the first person
in world history to

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,505
think of programming
something.

208
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:16,720
She is the founder
of our industry.

209
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,660
There's the women who were
Astronaut Corps.

210
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,590
Nobody knew about them.

211
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,510
We know about the men.

212
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,510
Some of the most decorated
Americans, of course, are the

213
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,040
astronauts from the "Apollo"
and "Mercury" times.

214
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,560
They were there.

215
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,180
They just weren't
allowed to fly.

216
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,170
Grace Hopper, this is the
Whirlwind project at MIT.

217
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,059
The Bletchley code crackers, the
Enigma code crackers from

218
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,860
World War II, more than half
women, mathematicians.

219
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,672
Hedy Lamar, Hedy Lamar helps you
have your cell phone work.

220
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,850
And up on the top, there's
a wonderful thing that

221
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,620
Singularity University launched
last week and

222
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,210
encouraged all of us to help.

223
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,340
It's a crowd-sourced
history idea.

224
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,480
And so innovatingwomen.org,
please go there.

225
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,800
Please help capture
these stories.

226
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
And last, I want to
point to this

227
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,710
picture down on the bottom &mdash;

228
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,690
University of Pennsylvania,
World War II.

229
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,510
I want to bring Kathy
Kleiman on stage.

230
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,510
She's going to share an
extraordinary story from

231
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,550
history that I was lucky Brad
Feldman alerted me to.

232
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,430
He's here.

233
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:08,700
Kathy.

234
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,720
[APPLAUSE]

235
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,100
KATHY KLEIMAN: Thank
you so much, Megan.

236
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,870
I'm thrilled to be here with all
of you today, and I have

237
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,830
an amazing story to
share with you.

238
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,960
But first, I have
two questions.

239
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,610
The first one is, does anybody
here know who invented the

240
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,860
first sort routine?

241
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,610

242
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,860
It was Betty Holberton.

243
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,820
Another question, who invented
the first software

244
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,620
application?

245
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,960
That was Betty Holberton, too.

246
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,210
We don't know about her because
she was never written

247
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,040
into formal computer history.

248
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,030
In fact, her story was almost
completely untold

249
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,030
for a very long time.

250
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,300
I know because I found it.

251
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,660
Can we go to the
slide, please?

252
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,305
Thank you.

253
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,660
No, because I found it.

254
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,310
When I was an undergraduate and
a computer programmer, I

255
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,960
felt very isolated.

256
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,510
I didn't see women around me.

257
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,700
I didn't see them
in my classes.

258
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,980
I didn't see them
as faculty in my

259
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,850
computer science classes.

260
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,850
So I turned to history to see
if I could find role models,

261
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,560
and I found this picture.

262
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,070
This is of the ENIAC, the first
all electronic digital

263
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,820
computer it was a secret project
during World War II at

264
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
the University of
Pennsylvania.

265
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,950
And when I found the pictures,
the men were in the captions.

266
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,260
That's J. Presper Eckert and
John Mauchly on the left and

267
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,040
right front, and they're the
co-inventors of the ENIAC,

268
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,240
very famous.

269
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,490
But there are women in these
pictures, and I wanted to know

270
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,960
who they were, and they weren't
in the captions.

271
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,140
So I took the picture, and I
went to a leading computer

272
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,260
historian, and I asked
her who they were.

273
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,866
And she said, the refrigerator
ladies.

274
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,250
I said, refrigerator lady?

275
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,520
She said, they're models posed
in front of the machine to

276
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,070
make it look good, like the
Frigidaire models who used to

277
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,150
open the new refrigerators
with such a flourish.

278
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,820
Well, they didn't look
like models to me.

279
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,100
These women look like they
belong in this picture, and

280
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,080
they look like they know exactly
what they're doing.

281
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,290
So I set out to find
them, and I did.

282
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,080
That's Jean Bartik in the far
back, and Ruth Lichterman

283
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,870
Teitelbaum in the front.

284
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,380
They were two of the original
ENIAC programmers, and I was

285
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,150
thrilled to learn that all six
of the original programmers

286
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,270
were women.

287
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,320
So now I'm going to
take a pause.

288
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,550
Thanks to the wonderful Women
Techmakers, I've been able to

289
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,000
bring you a short video of the
ENIAC programmers telling you

290
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,630
a bit of their story
themselves.

291
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,710
It's part of oral histories
I've collected over many

292
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,460
years, and I'm thrilled to be
able to share this with you.

293
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,404
[APPLAUSE]

294
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,376
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

295
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:41,470
-From the very beginning, you're
going to be a first in

296
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,430
a lot of things.

297
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,440
-I've never since never been in
as exciting an environment.

298
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,870
We knew we were pushing
back frontiers.

299
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,300
-In February of 1946, six months
after World War II had

300
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,340
ended, America learned
of a secret Army

301
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,210
project called ENIAC.

302
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,100
It was the first

303
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,750
all-electronic digital computer.

304
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,060
Yet the tale of ENIAC's
programming by a group of

305
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,260
young women has been all but
erased from computer history.

306
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,540
During World War II, the US had
assembled a crew of nearly

307
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,020
100 mathematically trained women
whose official title was

308
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,480
Computer, women who were
computing complex ballistic

309
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,770
trajectory equations by hand and
using mechanical desktop

310
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,980
calculators.

311
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,500
In the spring of 1945, six were
selected to figure out

312
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,720
how to program the
ENIAC machine &mdash;

313
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,230
Fran Bilas, Betty Jean Jennings,
Ruth Lichterman,

314
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,640
Kathleen McNulty, Betty Snyder,
Marlyn Wescoff.

315
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,670
-We were computing ballistic
tables on a hand calculator.

316
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,392
We were computing, and
we were computers.

317
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:51,580
-There logical diagrams of the
ENIAC, and we were supposed to

318
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,480
study them to figure out
how to program it.

319
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,540
The ENIAC was a son of
a bitch to program.

320
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,460
-ENIAC became legend.

321
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,300
Eckert and Mauchly
became famous.

322
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,770
However, the ENIAC programmer
story, the story of these six

323
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,280
women founders who created the
first sort routine, first

324
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,390
software application, and became
the first teachers of

325
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,230
modern programming
was never told.

326
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,140
Their work dramatically altered
computing in the 1940s

327
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,450
and 1950s as they paved
the path to

328
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,630
modern computer science.

329
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,790
-At that time, the emphasis was
on the invention of the

330
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,160
ENIAC, I mean, developing, and
the mechanics, the hardware.

331
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,930
-We were like fighter pilots.

332
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,460
I mean, here was this great,
great machine, but you

333
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,610
couldn't just take any ordinary
pilot and stick them

334
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,000
into a fighter pilot and
say, go to it now, man.

335
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,120
I mean, that was not the
way it was going to be.

336
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,010
-I had a fantastic life.

337
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,400
Everything I did was the
beginning of something new.

338
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,660
-I really loved working
with those girls.

339
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,332

340
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:58,250

they amazing?

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,750
[APPLAUSE]

343
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,230
KATHY KLEIMAN: And their work
didn't stop with ENIAC.

344
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,840
They became the first teachers
of modern programming.

345
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,740
They became the first modern
professional programmers.

346
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,240
And Betty and Jean went on to
program BINAC and UNIVAC, the

347
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,220
first commercial computers, and
they created innovative

348
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,010
tools that changed the face
of programming forever.

349
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,730
Absolutely amazing.

350
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,290
And in a very nice twist,
Betty Holberton actually

351
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,680
interviewed Grace Hopper
to invite her down to

352
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,200
Eckert-Mauchly Computer
Corporation, the first

353
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,810
commercial modern computing
company, and

354
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,910
Grace, of course, accepted.

355
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,900
So now &mdash;

356
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,180
thank you.

357
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,930
So now, today, I have an amazing
announcement to make.

358
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,650
After so many years of
recording their oral

359
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,980
histories, researching their
accomplishments, and working

360
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,190
so closely with the ENIAC
programmers, I'm thrilled to

361
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,250
tell you that and I'm thrilled
to announce here, that final

362
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,900
funding has finally been put
together so that I can produce

363
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,790
a documentary and finish my book
on the ENIAC programmers

364
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,950
and share the story
with all of you.

365
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:17,300
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

366
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,410
KATHY KLEIMAN: This is happening
because Megan Smith

367
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,760
introduced me to two remarkable

368
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,410
technical women of vision &mdash;

369
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,520
Anne Wojcicki and Lucy
Southworth Page.

370
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,830
And they're providing wonderful
support through

371
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,620
their foundations, The Brin
Wojcicki Foundation and the

372
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,830
Donor Advised Fund on behalf
of Lucy Southworth Page.

373
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,775
And I really want to applaud
them, because this is amazing.

374
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:46,010
[APPLAUSE]

375
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,040
KATHY KLEIMAN: And thanks to
this support, I will be in

376
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,710
production this summer with the
Paul Freeman Film Group,

377
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,680
and we will be producing a
documentary, and we'll have a

378
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,460
book for you very,
very shortly.

379
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,590
I can't wait to share the
story in its full form.

380
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,880
And now I want to share just a
personal story about how I

381
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,170
learned firsthand what history
and visibility can do to shape

382
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,390
our viewpoints.

383
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,840
Ten years ago, when my son was
five, he came over to me with

384
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,300
a very confused look
on his face.

385
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,720
He'd grown up with my work on
the ENIAC programmers, and

386
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,000
he'd even met and actually
played with four of the

387
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,230
original six ENIAC
programmers.

388
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,850
And he looked upset/ and he
said, mom, I know that women

389
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,110
can be computer programmers,
but can men be

390
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,360
programmers, too?

391
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,830

392
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,960
I assured him that, of course,
women and men could be

393
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,190
programmers, and in fact,
technology was better when we

394
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,240
created it together.

395
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,570
And when I left him two nights
ago, he was programming.

396
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,610
And so what I want to do and
conclude is say stay tuned for

397
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,390
more about the ENIAC
programmers.

398
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,520
And please join me in the quest
to capture wonderful

399
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,680
stories of women in
technology, so we

400
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,810
don't lose any more.

401
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,850
And on behalf of all of us,
I want to thank you.

402
00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:02,900
[APPLAUSE]

403
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,760
MEGAN SMITH: And first off,
thank you to all of our

404
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,190
amazing lightning speakers.

405
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,420
You guys were incredible.

406
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,259
[APPLAUSE]

407
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,310
MEGAN SMITH: And also to
Stephanie, and Phoebe, and

408
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,760
Mimi, and Sinead, and Judith,
who helped us put all this

409
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,069
together with the amazing
I/O team.

410
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,180
Just quickly, Larry talked
about thinking big.

411
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,060
We've been talking about the
idea of moon shots, you know,

412
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,770
going 10x instead of 1x.

413
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,500
And so we &mdash;

414
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,420
my colleague Astro and I have
launched this site in this

415
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,160
sort of goal to have the meme
of moon shot thinking be

416
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,740
something that more of us do.

417
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,900
So Solve For X is this
idea of there's a big

418
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,090
problem in the world.

419
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,170
There's some kind of crazy
technology that is there.

420
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,090
It feels like science fiction,
or there's a reuse of

421
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,480
something old that we just
might be able to use as a

422
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,780
radical solution to solve big
problems in the world, be they

423
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,600
self-driving cars, or poverty,
or water, or just

424
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,860
more fun for everybody.

425
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,720
And the main thing about this
is that it's on the web.

426
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,150
It's open.

427
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,250
And so there's lots of proposals
already up, and

428
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,220
we've partnered with the X
Prize and TED and Arizona

429
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,790
State University, Singularity,
this great set of movies from

430
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,890
GE's Focus Forward about moon
shots that people are taking.

431
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,290
And so we're just trying to get
the conversation going and

432
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,910
really celebrate people who are
starting, or who are in

433
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,630
process of moon shot, because we
always celebrate the people

434
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,050
who made it, but we really
want to get more about

435
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,210
collaborating and teamwork.

436
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,890
Bill Clinton calls the 21st
century the century of

437
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,170
creative collaboration.

438
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,720
And really, the web and
all the things, we

439
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,760
already know that.

440
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,090
We already feel that.

441
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,910
So that's what Solve
For X is about.

442
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,820
And along those lines, there's
an idea that we have as part

443
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,010
of it &mdash; my clicker's
not working &mdash;

444
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,370
about your x, like x is a
problem in the world or

445
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,970
something you're passionate
about.

446
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,940
So I was really lucky as a
student to get to take

447
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,320
acoustics at MIT from Professor

448
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,550
Bose, as in Bose speakers.

449
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,980
He was an extraordinary
professor.

450
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,380
And at one point during our
classes, he paused, and he

451
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,320
went into a lecture
about life.

452
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
And one of the key things he
said is, you know, you guys

453
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,970
are really talented.

454
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,890
You're doing great things.

455
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,570
You're going for it.

456
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,490
The key thing now for you is,
figure out what are you

457
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,610
passionate about.

458
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,910
In some ways, what's your x?

459
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,800
What do you care about?

460
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,180
What do you want to work on?

461
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,260
Because if you find that,
you're going to be

462
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,300
unstoppable, and you will do
extraordinary things to help

463
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,770
people make things great
in the world.

464
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,570
And I think that the women who
we've heard from have found

465
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,800
their x, and I hope that
everybody will be

466
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,680
thinking that way.

467
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,440
I welcome everybody to
stay afterwards.

468
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,870
I think Susan has to
catch a plane, but

469
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,180
everybody else is here.

470
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,770
There's a bunch of great
websites up, like the

471
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,160
makers.com site.

472
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,670
And in fact, today I heard &mdash;

473
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,290
somebody just told me that
Susan's story is up on the

474
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,630
homepage of AOL, so
she's one of the

475
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,360
Makers, and she's there.

476
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,320
And again, we've launched Google
Makers at Google, and

477
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,500
we hope that other companies and
other organizations will

478
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,080
start telling the stories,
which leads me back to

479
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
visibility.

480
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,300
And let's make people visible.

481
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,100
Help us do it.

482
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,870
And thank you so much
for being here.

483
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,675
[APPLAUSE]
