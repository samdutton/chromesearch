1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,465

2
00:00:02,465 --> 00:00:03,715
CHARLES L. CHEN: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:06,010

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,130
So we're here to talk about
advancing web accessibility

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,610
with ChromeVox.

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,530
I'm Charles Chen.

7
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,070
I have two of my colleagues
here with

8
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,230
me, Volker and David.

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,070
You guys want to say
hi to everyone?

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,730
VOLKER SORGE: Hello.

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,170
DAVID TSENG: Hi, everyone.

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,290
CHARLES L. CHEN: OK.

13
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,540
So let's get started.

14
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,480

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,450
Here's a brief overview
of what we'll be

16
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,780
talking about today.

17
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,240
Stat off with an introduction
about what is ChromeVox.

18
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,280
David will take you on a
walk through the DOM.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,870
Volker will discuss
reading math.

20
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,970
I will talk about how to use
ChromeVox APIs in your own

21
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,120
applications and web apps.

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,470
And then we'll have a conclusion
to sum up what

23
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,720
we've talked about.

24
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,700
So with that, what
is ChromeVox?

25
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,960
Well, ChromeVox is a screen
reader for Chrome which brings

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,600
the speed, versatility, and
security of Chrome to

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,170
visually-impaired users.

28
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,860
What's special about ChromeVox
is that we built all of this

29
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,320
with web technologies, such
as HTML5 and JavaScript.

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,250
So there's no impedance
mismatch between what

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,610
ChromeVox does and the rest of
the web and your web apps.

32
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,040
This allows us to advance
accessibility at the same rate

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,190
as all of you innovate and
create new exciting web

34
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,160
applications and really push
the boundaries of what is

35
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,810
possible to do inside
the browser.

36
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,790
There are huge benefits for end
users and web developers.

37
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,420
For end users, you get a screen
reader that's built

38
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,950
into your system.

39
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,770
On any Chrome OS machine, you
just press Control-C, and it

40
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,560
will start talking.

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,060
So it's right there.

42
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,160
It's also available
on desktops.

43
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,810
And for web developers, you get
something really unique.

44
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,110
You have a screen reader that
works inside your browser that

45
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,430
fits with your development
workflow.

46
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,120
You can do some work, run
ChromeVox on it, and then

47
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,550
listen to it and see what
it sounds like.

48
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,220
Because it is built with web
technologies, there isn't any

49
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,620
sort of mismatch between what
you would expect, in terms of

50
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,390
you can do with JavaScript and
the underlying platform.

51
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,020
The underlying platform
is JavaScript and web.

52
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,590
So any time you want to do
something that's custom, there

53
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,630
is a way for you to do it.

54
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,420
And we've opened up several APIs
to help you create better

55
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,940
auditory experiences
on the web.

56
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,550

57
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,320
And with that, I will now hand
it over to David, who will

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,538
give us an overview of how
you walk through the DOM.

59
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,740
Probably just a little bit
to your right, OK?

60
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,125
OK.

61
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,330
Perfect.

62
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,940
DAVID TSENG: Thanks, Charles.

63
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,390
Good evening, everyone.

64
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,900
My name is David Tseng.

65
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,490
I'm a software engineer on
the Accessibility Team.

66
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,700
I work on ChromeVox
and Chrome OS.

67
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,010
So tonight I'm going to give
you a behind the scenes

68
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,200
insider look at how ChromeVox
works under the hood.

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,150
So as you can see above on the
slide, to the left you have a

70
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,330
pretty innocent looking
piece of markup.

71
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,080
It's pretty simple.

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,210
And unordered list of links and
an editable text, input

73
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,510
type equals text,
and a button.

74
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,780
So if you ask yourself, well,
how does a screen reading

75
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,150
actually take something like
this and generate a

76
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,350
description and make it possible
for a keyboard-only

77
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,960
user, or someone who doesn't
see the screen, to explore

78
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,610
this content?

79
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,530
How does someone do that?

80
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,810
I can take you through some
alternatives and how ChromeVox

81
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,470
actually does it.

82
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,650
So you can imagine, I could
just take all of the text

83
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,620
content inside of the
unordered list

84
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,620
and just speak it.

85
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,940
So the problem with that is we
don't get any of the semantics

86
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,850
such as this is a list and
these are some links.

87
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,100
So that's probably
not a good idea.

88
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,830
How about, say, let's let the
user move from the structure

89
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,149
of this markup, so we can
imagine a system where we let

90
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,760
the user land on the unordered
list, let them move down into

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,280
the links and move about in the
links and move out, then

92
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,760
go to, say, the editable
text field.

93
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,620
That's a little closer to
what ChromeVox does.

94
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,500
So what it actually
does ChromeVox do?

95
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,230
Well, we centered around and
we converged on the idea of

96
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,180
granularity.

97
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,540
Let me define what
a granularity is.

98
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:54,090
A granularity consists of two
things, some notion of what a

99
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,380
leaf node is, so how deep did we
go in this tree structure,

100
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:05,070
and what it means to go to
a next or previous item.

101
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,750
I'll go ahead and show you what
our base granularity is,

102
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,540
which we call Object.

103
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,960
Now for this, we actually define
a leaf node as any sort

104
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,560
of interesting element, such
as a link or a button or an

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,200
editable text field.

106
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,470
and the next or previous item
just as one of these

107
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,650
interesting items.

108
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,340
So with that, I'm going to go
ahead and enable ChromeVox and

109
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,910
show you what it's like to
navigate in this very

110
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,340
sequential fashion.

111
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,702
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Enabling
spoken feedback.

112
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:44,360
Article list with four items.

113
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,270
Web, link list item.

114
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,790
DAVID TSENG: So this is the
first interesting item.

115
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,620
And you'll notice that ChromeVox
said article and the

116
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,420
text of the link and the role,
link, and played an earcon,

117
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,830
which is analogous to an
icon, just a sound

118
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,300
representing some concept.

119
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,650
So the article, which you heard,
is the context, which

120
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,790
means that this markup was
surrounded by something that

121
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,345
was an article, an audio role.

122
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:18,220
All right.

123
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,335
So if I continue navigating,
I'll end up on another link

124
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:24,330
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Maps,
link list item.

125
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,890
DAVID TSENG: And another link.

126
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,300
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Images,
link list item.

127
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,020
Gmail, link list item.

128
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,100
Google.

129
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,050
DAVID TSENG: And that's
actually a paragraph.

130
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,860
So that's a basic introduction
to one of our first

131
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,800
granularities, object.

132
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,010
So what are some other
interesting granularities?

133
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,610
Well, we also have defined
a character granularity.

134
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,920
And using that definition
I just gave you,

135
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,720
what does it mean?

136
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,680
Well, it just means that the
leaf node is now a text node,

137
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,140
and the next and previous items
are just the next and

138
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,010
previous characters within
that text node.

139
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,450
So I have a command in ChromeVox
that says Change

140
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,570
Granularities.

141
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,110
CHROMEVOX VOICE: [INAUDIBLE]

142
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:18,070
character, G, O, O,
G, L, E. Echo.

143
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,930
DAVID TSENG: I was able to scan
that text node just by

144
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,020
walking through the
characters.

145
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,800
And you also heard a nice
feature of ChromeVox that does

146
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,220
a phonetic map for
the letters.

147
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,310
So if there's any ambiguity in
the text-to-speech, such as an

148
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,740
engine that doesn't have the
clearest announcement of

149
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,670
characters, we can give users
another hint after a little

150
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:48,290
bit of a pause and speak the
word that phonetically can

151
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,430
describe that character.

152
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,540
So we have some other
granularities, the usual ones

153
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,280
that you would expect,
word and line.

154
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,270
So those are interesting
because they break on

155
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,520
different delimiters.

156
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,450
And so the next and previous
definition of the granularity

157
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,000
is the only thing that we
need to change there.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,810
Beyond these basic
granularities, ChromeVox

159
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,570
supports tables.

160
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:21,220
And we're able to get the
tables to fit into this

161
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,520
definition by saying, OK, next
and previous are rows, and

162
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,730
leaf nodes are just the
rows' items elements.

163
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,330
And finally, we have some
interesting developments that

164
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,450
just got released with ChromeVox
27, which was just

165
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,830
put up on the web store,
that knows how to

166
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,650
deal with math content.

167
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,252
And with that, I will invite
Volker Sorge to talk more on

168
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:52,950
that subject.

169
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,200
VOLKER SORGE: Thank you
very much, David.

170
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,800

171
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,810
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Disabling
spoken feedback.

172
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,465
VOLKER SORGE: So my name
is Volker Sorge.

173
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:06,010
I'm actually a Senior Lecturer
at the University of

174
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,910
Birmingham in the UK.

175
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,240
But I'm spending a year working
with the ChromeVox

176
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,740
team here in California in
order to work on getting

177
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,450
mathematics spoken with
the ChromeVox engine.

178
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,460
And it is a sad fact that what
is still the biggest obstacle

179
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,850
for a fully inclusive
education for

180
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,860
visually-impaired students is
that much of the scientific

181
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,610
content that's available out
there is practically

182
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,750
inaccessible.

183
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,040
So at the ChromeVox team, we've
realized this, and we're

184
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,290
trying to make some way towards
making some of this

185
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,120
content accessible by at least
making the mathematics that

186
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,895
can be found on the web out
there accessible via a screen

187
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:54,640
reader

188
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,130
And as a consequence, we
implemented aural rendering

189
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,090
for mathematical content
in ChromeVox.

190
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,260
And if you're not familiar how
math really works on the web,

191
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,640
math is generally given in
MathML format, or it's being

192
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,800
rendered from either MathML or
other formats using MathJax.

193
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,790
And with ChromeVox, we can now
deal with both types of

194
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,010
mathematical content
that's on the web.

195
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,170
As a consequence, spoken math
is now supported on all

196
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,330
platforms that support Chrome.

197
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,670
So if you were within a Chrome
browser, you can use ChromeVox

198
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,430
in order to have math spoken.

199
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,740
And what might be particularly
interesting for developers, of

200
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,910
course, is that if you're, for
instance, developing the Epub3

201
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,460
reader, you can leverage all the
work we put into ChromeVox

202
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,540
using the WebViews interface.

203
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,050
And thereby, for instance, have
spoken math on Android

204
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,440
tablets or smartphones.

205
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,310
Right.

206
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,990
So let me dive into the details
a bit, how math is

207
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,120
actually being rendered.

208
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,950
Usually, it's rendered more
beautiful than this.

209
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,170
And I'll just tell you
why this is the case.

210
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:02,620
Here.

211
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,550
This is how math is
being rendered.

212
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,370
And you might recall
this equation.

213
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,350
This is the solution to the
quadratic equation.

214
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,150
Actually, it's two solutions.

215
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,050
And the way it's being given
generally on the web is by

216
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,210
using a MathML markup
language.

217
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,420
MathML, as you can see on the
left of this slide, is a

218
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,290
fairly straightforward XML
representation of what you

219
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,190
have up there as the
mathematical formula.

220
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,550
So you can fairly easily map
those, the x to the x and the

221
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,550
equals to the equals.

222
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,030
And then you have kind of a
structured tree representation

223
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,030
of what the math formula
is there.

224
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,810
Unfortunately, not every
browser renders MathML

225
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,700
straight away.

226
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,190
And as a consequence, there's
a tool out there, which is

227
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,810
called MathJax, which
can render math in

228
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,780
all browsers similarly.

229
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,920
And as a matter of fact, on this
slide actually we used

230
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,520
MathJax to render the slide.

231
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,560
And notice the little hiccup
we had in the beginning

232
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,510
because the rendering sometimes
breaks a bit and you

233
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,440
have to do a little reload.

234
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,430
So on the right-hand side of
the slide you see how,

235
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,990
actually the MathJax
looks like.

236
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,330
So if you have, for instance,
the MathML in your DOM

237
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,050
originally, then MathJax will
replace it in the live DOM in

238
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,310
your browser with the
right-hand side.

239
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,390
And then you see immediately
this is a lot less obvious

240
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,110
what the mapping between the
actual elements of the

241
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:33,180
mathematical formula is, as a
lot of it is obscured by some

242
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,060
of the markup that is necessary
for the rendering.

243
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,310
All right?

244
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,270
Nevertheless, within ChromeVox,
we can speak both

245
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,880
MathML and MathJax similarly.

246
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,350
So the aural rendering is then
done normally doing the text

247
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,730
navigation.

248
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,670
And I'll show you how
this then sounds.

249
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,820
Let me switch on the ChromeVox
engine again.

CHROMEVOX VOICE: Enabling

251
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,640
VOLKER SORGE: And now we go to
the next math expression.

252
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,170
CHROMEVOX VOICE: x equals minus
b plus/minus square root

253
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,880
of b squared minus 4ac
divided by 2a.

254
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,130
Math.

255
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,150

256
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,490
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

257
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,440
And so this is how it's being
pronounced while it's in

258
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,830
regular text.

259
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,780
So you can hear we are playing
a bit here with certain

260
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,630
changes of the speech.

261
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,790
For instance, we're changing the
rate and the pitch when we

262
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,020
go into the nesting of, say,
the square root or of the

263
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,590
numerator of the division.

264
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,310
Also, we change the pitch
when we go into sub and

265
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,770
superscript.

266
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,080
As a consequence, you can hear
where the square root actually

267
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,640
ends and where then the
division starts again.

268
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,810

269
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:52,150
Nevertheless, in many cases this
might be too fast for you

270
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,950
when you actually listen to this
expression, particularly

271
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,540
if it's a very large
expression.

272
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,730
What you then would like to
do and what we provide &mdash;

VOLKER SORGE: Let me switch

275
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,850
What you then would like to do
is actually start exploring

276
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,230
the mathematical expression
a bit further.

277
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,990
And indeed, in ChromeVox we now
provide some functionality

278
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,150
in order to do this.

279
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,870
So what you could hear
originally when you listened

280
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,000
to the formula is that it's
being announced as a math

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,180

Now it announced math.

289
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,800
Now we know we have a math
expression under our cursor,

290
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,360
effectively.

291
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,350
And now we can actually explore
it, if we want to.

292
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,490
So let's start exploring it.

So the idea is, if I had been
able to show that to you now,

350
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,580
that you can actually enter the
math expression and then

351
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,950
start walking the
math expression.

352
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,650
Currently, this traversal
follows fairly

353
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,130
the syntactic structure.

354
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,230
So you can listen to it, x
equals and then the expression

355
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,920
on the right-hand side
of the equality.

356
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,810
In the future, what we're
currently working on and what

357
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,920
will be released soon is that we
have a more systematic way

358
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,990
of actually exploring the
mathematical expression in a

359
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:19,329
particular way to customize
this exploration.

360
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,119
CHROMEVOX VOICE: x equals
minus b plus/minus.

361
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,160
x equals minus b plus &mdash;

362
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,710
x equals minus b &mdash; x equals &mdash;

363
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,610
x equals &mdash;

364
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,680
x &mdash;

365
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,015
VOLKER SORGE: Ah.

366
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,010
There you go.

367
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,620
Sorry.

368
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,060
Now we're actually on
the expression.

369
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,290
Now it actually works.

370
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,590
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Equals.

371
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,100
VOLKER SORGE: So now we're
actually exploring the

372
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,610
expression.

373
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,240
If you can look, we're exploring
the left-hand side.

374
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,750
If I go back &mdash;

375
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,020
CHROMEVOX VOICE: x &mdash;

376
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,920
VOLKER SORGE: --x &mdash;

377
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,310
CHROMEVOX VOICE: --equals &mdash;

378
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,070
VOLKER SORGE: --equals &mdash;

379
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,850
CHROMEVOX VOICE: --minus b &mdash;

380
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,180
VOLKER SORGE: Now we get the
right-hand side of the

381
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,520
expression.

382
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,440
CHROMEVOX VOICE: --b squared
minus 4ac divided by 2a.

383
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,350
VOLKER SORGE: And now we can
start exploring further.

384
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,300
So we get a bit further.

385
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,360
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Minus b
plus/minus square root of b

386
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,720
squared minus 4ac.

387
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,870
VOLKER SORGE: So if you still
haven't fully understood

388
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,710
what's in the expression,
you can go further.

389
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,860
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Minus b
plus/minus square root of b

390
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,000
squared minus 4ac.

391
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,020
VOLKER SORGE: And now
you can start

392
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,500
entering the square root.

393
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,200
CHROMEVOX VOICE: b squared
minus 4ac.

394
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,850
VOLKER SORGE: And so
on, and so forth.

395
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,400
So this is the basic idea
of how to explore the

396
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,320
mathematical expression.

397
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,220
And as you can see, we followed
pretty much the

398
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,960
syntactic structure as it is.

399
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,500
My apologies that I fat fingered
this and it didn't

400
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,000
work from the beginning.

401
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,660
Obviously, now we're
in the expression.

402
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,530
Now we can also leave the
expression again.

403
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,810
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Cut.

404
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,540
VOLKER SORGE: And then once
we're outside the expression &mdash;

405
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,700
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Disabling
spoken feedback.

406
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,810
VOLKER SORGE: --we can then
actually continue working with

407
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,060
ChromeVox as normal.

408
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,950

409
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,420
Right.

410
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,790
Now one of the major things
about mathematics and speaking

411
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,620
mathematics is, of course, that
it can be very different,

412
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,690
four depending on the
mathematical domain you're

413
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,380
working with and also depending
on the particular

414
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,600
style of mathematics
you're doing.

415
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,980
As a consequence, we've built
everything in ChromeVox in a

416
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,670
very customizable fashion,
which means that one can

417
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:20,240
contribute to the way
mathematics is spoken.

418
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,170
Say if you want to work on your
favorite mathematical

419
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,880
topic and you want ChromeVox to
be able to speak all things

420
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,140
correctly, then you can
contribute speaking rules for

421
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,930
the speech engine or for the
ChromeVox engine as well as

422
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,900
just mappings for separate
characters.

423
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,040
For instance, here I've put down
a couple of equations on

424
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,550
the screen.

425
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:47,080
One is just a division followed
by a multiplication,

426
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,870
a divided by b times c.

427
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,120
And on the right-hand side, if
you're familiar with natural

428
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,220
deduction calculations &mdash;

429
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,120
some with you might be from
your logic class &mdash;

430
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,940
then this is a natural
deduction.

431
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,510
And either way, you want it
pronounced differently.

432
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,630
On the one hand side, you want
it to be pronounced as divided

433
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,100
by, and the other side you
want it to be pronounced,

434
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,880
let's say, the second part of
the rules follows from the

435
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,380
first part of the rule.

436
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,000
And I've put down the simple
JavaScript functions that

437
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,770
allow a user or a contributor to
customize our speech rules

438
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:28,990
accordingly for the different
expressions that you have.

439
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,460
In addition to just customizing
them by entering

440
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,750
effectively different orders
in which things are being

441
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,120
spoken and entering different
types of strings that are

442
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,210
being spoken.

443
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,570
You can also make optional
changes to, say, things like

444
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,050
pitch, rate, volume, as well as
pausing for effect, as we

445
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,160
had earlier in the quadratic
rule formula.

446
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,690

447
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:55,950
Right.

448
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,120
This is one way of
customizing it.

449
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,970
And then how can this actually
be used by people that want to

450
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,410
develop, say, an Epub3
reader with it?

451
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,700
Well, we have a fairly easy
way to interface to the

452
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,480
mathematics as to everything
in ChromeVox.

453
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,955
And if you just pass a math node
that you come across in

454
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:19,270
the DOM at the right level to
ChromeVox, either as MathML or

455
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,370
as the rendered MathJax in the
DOM, then we have a fairly

456
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,635
simple API function with which
the note gets spoken.

457
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:30,390
And you can leverage all the
machinery that we put into

458
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:36,660
ChromeVox in order to speak
mathematics with your own app.

459
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,660
And the particular API function
here is just syncing

460
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,700
to the particular math node.

461
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,190
And there are some other API
functions, which I'll now ask

462
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,010
Charles to explain to
you in more detail.

463
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,750
Thank you.

464
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,090
CHARLES L. CHEN:
Thanks, Volker.

465
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,590
So we've talked about how
ChromeVox works as well as

466
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,500
some of the cool new math
features that are coming out.

467
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,050
Let's see how you can use
ChromeVox in your own web

468
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,300
application.

469
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,190

470
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,790
Let me just refresh
this page here.

471
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,290

472
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,540
OK.

473
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,290

474
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:19,940
OK.

475
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,360
So why would you want to
use ChromeVox APIs?

476
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,830
Well, these APIs give
you, as the

477
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,350
developer, a lot of control.

478
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,310
It helps you to help give
ChromeVox hints about how it

479
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,710
should be speaking content.

480
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,430
It lets you give ChromeVox hints
about where the user is

481
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,140
in your application.

482
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,180
And the most recent feature that
we added with our last

483
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,150
release of ChromeVox has been
the ability to get at what the

484
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,700
user is trying to do on
your web application.

485
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,770
So for example, on ChromeVox, as
David was showing earlier,

486
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,240
when you navigate, you can
navigate structurally.

487
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,750
So you can say, jump to the next
list item, or go to the

488
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,390
next link, so on and so forth.

489
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:06,330
But what if you, as a web
developer, had a web

490
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,200
application where it had
semantic structure to it but

491
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,170
that wasn't necessarily
exposed to the user?

492
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,090
If the user wants to go to the
next heading, your web app may

493
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,980
be much better equipped to
do that than ChromeVox.

494
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,980
And so, in ChromeVox, wherever
the user tries to do an

495
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,440
action, we actually send it to
the underlying web app so that

496
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,380
the web app gets first
dibs on handling it.

497
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,830
And so if it can handle it
better, it can do it instead

498
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,490
of ChromeVox and just pass
the result back.

499
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,370
There's full documentation
available on this link, and

500
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,690
these slides will be made
available after I/O. But let's

501
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,430
go through some code samples of
how you can apply this in

502
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,560
your applications.

503
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,980
So one thing that could be
really useful to you as a web

504
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,870
developer is to be able to
speak custom messages.

505
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,120
So let's see how this
would sound.

506
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,790

507
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,910
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Enabling
spoken feedback.

508
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,810
CHARLES L. CHEN: OK.

509
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,440
So sometimes you may be doing
something in your web

510
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,910
application where visually it's
obvious what's happened.

511
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,830
But it would be useful to give
someone who's using a screen

512
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,070
reader, such a ChromeVox, an
idea of what you actually did.

513
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,890
So right now, the code there
is how I am going to make

514
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,380
ChromeVox speak this
next message.

515
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,330
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Code
highlighting off.

516
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,240
Code highlighting enabled.

517
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,540
CHARLES L. CHEN: OK.

518
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,300
Code highlighting enabled.

519
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,630
And when I turn it off &mdash;

520
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,500
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Code
highlighting off.

521
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:31,830
CHARLES L. CHEN: OK.

522
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,010
So as you can see, visually it
was obvious, because the code

523
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,020
that I had bolded was
immediately highlighted.

524
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,800
Everything else faded out.

525
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,170
But it's nice to be able to
auditorial convey that

526
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,380
information.

527
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,670
And so all it took was this
one line of code here.

528
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,790
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Code
highlighting enabled.

529
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,810
CHARLES L. CHEN: You just call
ChromeVox Api.speak, give it

530
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,210
this string of text, and
it just speaks it.

531
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,790
Pretty simple.

532
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,500
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Speaking
custom messages.

533
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,530
Heading 3.

534
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,140
Sticky mode disabled.

535
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,450
CHARLES L. CHEN: OK.

536
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,540
CHROMEVOX VOICE:
ChromeVox APIs.

537
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,270
Speaking custom messages.

538
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,420
Function speak current slide.

539
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,970
CHARLES L. CHEN: Now what
you notice there is

540
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,300
I flipped the slide.

541
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,940
And it actually started reading
the slide to me.

542
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,990
So when it did that, this is
another example of using a

543
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,060
ChromeVox speech APIs
is that you can

544
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,510
make it speak something.

545
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:29,320
And I'm actually beginning to
lose my train of thought here.

546
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,680
I probably should have
practiced more.

547
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,940
But this is actually why
it's really cool to

548
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,010
have speaker notes.

549
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,890
So let's try that.

550
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,550
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Show how easy
it was to add these AP is to

551
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,090
the I/O slide template.

552
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,480
CHARLES L. CHEN: Oh, yeah.

553
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,710
OK.

554
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,330
That's what I'm supposed
to be talking about.

555
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,480
So as you can see here, when I
press the key command to bring

556
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,360
up the speaker notes,
it actually spoke

557
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,790
those notes to me.

558
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,045
And now if I dismiss them &mdash;

559
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:52,655
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Notes hidden.

560
00:25:52,655 --> 00:25:54,270
CHARLES L. CHEN: --it tells
me notes hidden, and it

561
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,190
synchronizes me back to
the top of my slides.

562
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,630
On the other hand, if I try this
on a slide where I don't

563
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,660
have speaker notes &mdash;

564
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,460
CHROMEVOX VOICE:
ChromeVox APIs.

565
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,720
No notes available.

566
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,250
CHARLES L. CHEN: --it tells
me no notes available.

567
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,470
So I was actually pretty lucky
there that I forgot my content

568
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,520
on the side that has
speaker notes.

569
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,880
CHROMEVOX VOICE:
ChromeVox APIs.

570
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,620
Speaking custom messages.

571
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,420
Func code highlighting
enabled.

572
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:16,960
CHARLES L. CHEN: OK.

573
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,870
And as you to see, again, it's
really simple to do this.

574
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,370
Again, it's just a simple
ChromeVox API speak.

575
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,020
By the way, you'll notice that,
in this case, I have a

576
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,980
couple more arguments
in there.

577
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,230
And these arguments allow
me to control the voice.

578
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,810
So if you listen carefully &mdash;

579
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,460
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Show how easy
it was to add these APIs to

580
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,860
the I/O slide template.

581
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,320
CHARLES L. CHEN: Notice
how that voice

582
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,850
was at a lower pitch.

583
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,750
So that's a way to give the user
a little bit more flavor.

584
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,210
In this case, it's to indicate
that this in a slide.

585
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,910
It's speaker note and
not main content.

586
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,630
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Notes hidden.

587
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,520
ChromeVox APIs.

588
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,410
CHARLES L. CHEN: Now another
thing that's useful is if

589
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,805
you're navigating for your
application and a user wants

590
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:01,180
to suddenly investigate more
or try navigating from a

591
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,030
certain point, it's useful
to synchronize the user's

592
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,500
position with where
they actually are.

593
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,560
And ChromeVox makes this
really simple.

594
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:15,260
All you have to do is just call
API sync to node, and

595
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,255
you'll basically tell ChromeVox
that, hey, the user

596
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:18,610
is over here right now.

597
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,060
And it will position them
at the correct spot.

598
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,580
As I showed earlier in the notes
slide, this is actually

599
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,310
what allowed me to put myself
back on the heading after the

600
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,230
user dismissed the
speaker notes.

601
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,160
So it's great for focused
management.

602
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,980
And again &mdash;

603
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,740
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Code
highlighting enabled.

604
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,990
CHARLES L. CHEN: --really
simple there.

605
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,080
The second parameter just
controls whether or not to

606
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,600
automatically speak
or if you want to

607
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,620
speak a custom message.

608
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,150
CHROMEVOX VOICE:
ChromeVox APIs.

609
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,850
Handling user navigation.

610
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,080
Functions &mdash;

611
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,990
CHARLES L. CHEN: Now as I
mentioned earlier, sometimes

612
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,260
your web application can do
a much better job with

613
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,480
navigation than ChromeVox,
because it knows its own

614
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,100
semantic structure.

615
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,330
In the case of the slides, when
I'm not on a slide, all

616
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,370
the other content is actually
hidden, so it's

617
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,200
invisible to ChromeVox.

618
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,520
So if I were to search for a
next heading without any help

619
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,380
from the web app, I would
actually fail.

620
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,380
Because there's only
one heading here.

621
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,730
But since I give the web app the
ability to respond first,

622
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,660
you as the web developer
can actually say, wait.

623
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,650
I know how to deal with this
next heading thing.

624
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,060
I'm just going to do it.

625
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,640
It's pretty simple.

626
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,040
All you have to do is listen
for these ChromeVox events.

627
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,280
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Code
highlighting enabled.

628
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,100
CHARLES L. CHEN: So you're
just looking

629
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,200
for a cvox user event.

630
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,950
And then it has a detail
object underneath it.

631
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,270
And if you look at its command,
it tells you exactly

632
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,660
what the ChromeVox user is
trying to do, and you can

633
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,750
respond to that.

634
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,710
And so I'm actually going to
use that to navigate to my

635
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,496
next slide by going to
the next heading.

636
00:28:45,496 --> 00:28:47,830
Next heading.

637
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,490
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Handling
user navigation.

638
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,010
Heading &mdash;

639
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,330
CHARLES L. CHEN: OK.

640
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,540
So as you saw there, it jumped
me through that slide and took

641
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,600
me to the next slide.

642
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,020
In conclusion, what we covered
in this talk was how you can

643
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,270
navigate through the DOM with
different granularities and

644
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,320
how we're using the concept of
granularities to support

645
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,590
special content, such
as mathematics.

646
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,900
And we gave you an overview
of how to do this with the

647
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,030
ChromeVox APIs.

648
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:18,700
One thing to note is this
all works on Chrome.

649
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,370
And as I mentioned before, this
works on web technology.

650
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,590
So this works on Chrome
in any form.

651
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,330
This is also available
on Android.

652
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,300
And it's actually a huge boost
for developers, because now

653
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,150
you can develop on the desktop,
test it out, and then

654
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,890
when you run it on Android
you'll get the same effect.

655
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,690
And these APIs are also
available everywhere.

656
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,110
In the audience, I actually
see someone

657
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,480
from IDEAL Group there.

658
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,030
You can go ahead and wave.

659
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,820
So they're in our Sandbox,
and they're demoing their

660
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,750
integration of their Epub reader
with ChromeVox Android.

661
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,330
And they're taking advantage
of ChromeVox's ability to

662
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,750
speak math to make their Epub
reader even better.

663
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,010
We didn't cover in this talk
is that we actually have

664
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,960
Braille support on Android.

665
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,130
And we're also working
on it for Chrome.

666
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,010
There's a lot more complex and
advanced navigation features,

667
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,170
such as working with tables
sufficiently.

668
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:16,060
And then we also have HTML UI
controls, such as date/time

669
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,310
and media widgets.

670
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,580

671
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,820
CHROMEVOX VOICE: Less
than thank you.

672
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,270
CHARLES L. CHEN: The best way
to catch all that extra

673
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,760
content is to visit
our Sandbox.

674
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,310
And so please drop by
our Sandbox and come

675
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,110
to our office hours.

676
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,470
You can find all of this
information on chromevox.com.

677
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,260
And all of this code
is open source.

678
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,440
And these slides will be
available after I/O.

679
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,580
So with that, I see that
we have about a

680
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,780
minute left for questions.

681
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,470
So any questions?

682
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,720
Please come to the mic.

683
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,530

684
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,110
Sure.

685
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,155
AUDIENCE: I have one maybe
silly question.

686
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:58,000
But is it possible to
set up a phonetic

687
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,980
dictionary that you could &mdash;

688
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:06,040
As we were watching this, the
I/O or the "AP's" instead of

689
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,080
API, could I just contextually
say, for this period, I want

690
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,750
you to, when you meet the
word API, use the

691
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,960
sound API and not AP?

692
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,230
CHARLES L. CHEN: Yes.

693
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,780
So that is something that we
definitely want to make it

694
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,920
easier and have it
work better.

695
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,530
In general, that's usually an
issue with the text-to-speech

696
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,880
engine, so you probably don't
want to overcorrect for it.

697
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,780
That having been said, we do
have the notion of being able

698
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,740
to tag HTML elements and
nodes with hints.

699
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,810
It's in the API documentation.

700
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,380
But you can basically tell
ChromeVox exactly how a node

701
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,440
should be spoken.

702
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,460
And this allows you to pull
in additional semantic

703
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,270
information and speak it
more intelligibly.

704
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,100
AUDIENCE: Would you be able
to modify a dictionary.

705
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,810
The problem I've run into in
this situation is you end up

706
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,210
annotate every single instance,
when it would be

707
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,400
nice to just be able to have
a dictionary of sounds,

708
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,820
especially if you're doing
science content.

709
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,040
CHARLES L. CHEN: Yes.

710
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,440
So that's why we have the
reading rules from Volker.

711
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,870
Volker, do you want to
speak more to that?

712
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,580
VOLKER SORGE: OK.

713
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,930
Well, for the reading
rules, you can

714
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,800
effectively annotate things.

715
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,870
You can effectively annotate
single characters the way you

716
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,810
want them to be spoken.

717
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,630
Particularly for certain
mathematical

718
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,100
symbols, that's important.

719
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,180
Obviously, in many ways,
it is like a dictionary

720
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,140
that you can modify.

721
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,090
It would be ideal if then some
of these things that you

722
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,710
modify on our end also would be
spoken by the TDS engine,

723
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,520
which is obviously also a
particular problem with

724
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,225
English TDS, which is not
necessarily phonetic.

725
00:32:37,225 --> 00:32:37,720
Yeah.

726
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,020
But you can do it.

727
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,060
AUDIENCE: OK.

728
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,150
Thank you.

729
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,610
CHARLES L. CHEN: And ma'am,
you had a question?

730
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

731
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:43,800
CHARLES L. CHEN: Similar.

732
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,960
OK.

733
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,730
I think we're actually
running out of time.

734
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,960
So anyone else?

735
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,830
OK.

736
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,140
Well, thank you.

737
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,580
I hope you all enjoyed
this talk.

738
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,830
Please catch us in a Sandbox.

739
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,550
