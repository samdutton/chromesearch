1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:01,980
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: All right.

3
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,770
I see the clock counting
down, so I guess

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,963
we should get started.

5
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:11,410
First of all, thank you for
coming this late on a Friday.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,810
I'm quite impressed
with the turnout.

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,940
I can't believe this
many people had

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,190
nothing better to do.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,630

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,760
Anyways, thank you for coming.

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,340
I hope everyone has had good
I/O. This is the fireside chat

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,450
for Chrome, so this is your
opportunity to have one last

13
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,050
shot to ask us questions
before we

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,920
all turn into pumpkins.

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,830
Things that have come up over
through I/O or things are on

16
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,540
the top of your mind.

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,120
We'll quickly run through
just who we are.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,220
And something of a tradition
for fireside chats is we

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,540
usually begin with what each of
us is most interested in,

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,400
in terms of an upcoming feature
or what's on the top

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,480
of our mind.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,940
So we'll do that, and hopefully
that will inspire

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,950
some of you to hit the mics
and ask us questions.

24
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,170
Otherwise, it's just going to
be us talking for about 40

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,580
minutes, which probably isn't
going to be that interesting.

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,950
So definitely get your
questions ready.

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,070
I'm Ian Ellison-Taylor.

28
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,370
I'm the director of product
management for the web

29
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,500
platform part of Chrome.

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,640
I think we've already &mdash;

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,560
trying to think of the
top features as I

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,280
look down the line.

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,880
I think we've already hit,
probably, my favorite in the

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,950
keynote, which is Web Components
and the tool kit,

35
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,360
just simply for what I think it
will allow folks like you

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,580
to be able to do over the next
year, much more easily than

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,530
you've been able to do.

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,530
So I think that's going
to be my top feature.

39
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,780
So I will pass the mic.

40
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,620

41
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,590
LARS BAK: I'm Lars Bak.

42
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,120
I'm a software engineer
at Google.

43
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,580
And my favorite feature I look
forward to is speed.

44
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,210
And that'll come to you
in the form of Dart.

45
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,766

46
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:59,400
GREG SIMON: Hi, I'm
Greg Simon.

47
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,570
I'm managing director
for Blink.

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,690
And my most anticipated feature
that I can't wait to

49
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,320
see is the lazy-block layout.

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,780

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,680
ERIK KAY: Hi, Erik Kay.

52
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,670
I'm the instructor for Apps and
Extensions Native Client.

53
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,960
And I too am really excited
about Web Components.

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,540
I think it's been this huge gap
in the web platform that

55
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,400
were finally going to fill in,
and really make the web an

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,950
equal to other tool
kits out there.

57
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,920

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,160
DARIN FISHER: Hi, my name's
Darin Fisher.

59
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,580
I'm an eng lead on Chrome.

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,810
And by far the thing that I'm
most excited about is

61
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,610
performance, and I'm really
excited about what we're doing

62
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,090
to give you all back the main
thread and de-jank the

63
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,070
browser, make the rendering
engine much, much, much faster

64
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,501
and more responsive.

65
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,060
MATT MCNULTY: Hi, I'm
Matt McNulty.

66
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,910
I lead the polymer team.

67
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,810
And I'm most excited about Web
Components as well. 'cause

68
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,450
without them, we're dead.

69
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,260
[LAUGHTER]

70
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,965
JEFF CHANG: Hello.

71
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:02,240
Wow.

72
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,630
My name is Jeff Chang, and
I am a product manager on

73
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,830
Chrome's UI features
and releases.

74
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,010
And one of the things that I'm
most excited about personally

75
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,440
is WebRTC, particularly
on mobile.

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,390
I think the notion that you can
use your phone and fire up

77
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,430
a browser and just go to a
website and immediately be

78
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,450
able to video chat with
someone else, without

79
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,760
installing any plug-ins
or what not, I

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,880
think that's amazing.

81
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,210
VANGELIS KOKKEVIS: And I'm
Vangelis Kokkevis.

82
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,980
I'm the engineering lead for the
Chrome GPU team, for the

83
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,480
folks who take care of rendering
performance in

84
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,410
Chrome, including GPU
accelerating or rendering, and

85
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,520
some of the 3D APIs that we
currently have in Chrome.

86
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,320
And then I'll echo what
most people said here.

87
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,170
Performance is really what
we're after here.

88
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,950
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: Uh, we've
also got other members of the

89
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,770
Chrome team and other parts
of Google sitting in the

90
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,510
audience, as well.

91
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,710
So hopefully, we can answer
questions in any sort of area

92
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,830
that might be on your mind.

93
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,290
We have a couple of folks,
I see, from Adobe.

94
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,800
And Bruce, as well, from
Opera, who's on hand to

95
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,110
answer, maybe, if there are
general questions about web

96
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,930
standards, maybe get an
outside perspective.

97
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,260
I'm more than happy to hand
over the mic to Bruce and

98
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,540
others if people
have questions.

99
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,750
So with that, let's
get started.

100
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,730
First question.

101
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,990
Who wants to go first?

102
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,820
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

103
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,910
I was wondering why Chrome was
not the default browser and

104
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,990
web view in Android, and if
there is any light at the end

105
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,080
of the tunnel with that.

106
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,310
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: Who's most
qualified to answer that?

107
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,900
Darin?

108
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,500
DARIN FISHER: Well, I can just
say that that's something

109
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,520
that's being worked on.

110
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,980
You can see, if you go to
chromium.org, that there is an

111
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,020
Android WebView project
that can be built from

112
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,470
the Chromium sources.

113
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,070
It's a project that of course
we're really interested in.

114
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,610
I think Chrome is, our team is
all about making the web

115
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,280
platform better, and we want to
make sure that that extends

116
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,890
to the WebView that's available
on Android.

117
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,620
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: Yeah, and I
think just as time goes on,

118
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,530
the plan, we hope, is that
you'll see WebView and Chrome

119
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,170
increasingly become the default
on newer devices.

120
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,510
There's work to be
done, I think.

121
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,500
AUDIENCE: Since there aren't
many people standing, I

122
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,135
thought maybe I'd ask
one more question.

123
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:25,070
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR:
All right, sure.

124
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,570
AUDIENCE: I kind of see the
future of web IDs as being in

125
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,430
the user agents themselves,
and I think the Chrome

126
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,960
DevTools kind of realize this
vision the most out of any

127
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,880
sort of developer suite.

128
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,140
But it's not really quite there
yet, when you compare it

129
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,910
to things like Coda
and Sublime Text.

130
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,250
But it seems to be pushing
further and further in that

131
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,670
direction every year.

132
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,600
And I was wondering what the
team's philosophy or intent

133
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,930
was in this area.

134
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,870
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: Lars, are
you closest to DevTools?

135
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,580

136
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,450
ERIK KAY: I'll take a swing.

137
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,970
So unfortunately, Pavel's
not here.

138
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,980
But I mean, if anybody's been
following the progress of

139
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,680
Chrome DevTools over the last
couple years, I think the

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,142
changes they've made, the rate
of change is just amazing.

141
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:21,060
You check back every few months,
and it's like some

142
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,260
huge, awesome new feature
has landed.

143
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,850
And so this time around, yeah,
they did land code editing,

144
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,460
local code editing.

145
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,020
And so that's a new feature.

146
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,390
And since it's just added and
just showing up, I think it's

147
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,090
early days.

148
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,820
And so yes, they definitely want
to make it possible for

149
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,210
people to do end-to-end
development and to take care

150
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,770
of all the debugging needs, from
memory profiling to sort

151
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,260
of timeline rendering
performance &mdash;

152
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,420
I think end-to-end, they want
to do the whole thing.

153
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,600
And the other bit of philosophy,
by the way, just

154
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,150
from the team's perspective
is they don't &mdash;

155
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,980
even though they want to build
it into the browser so it's

156
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,330
there by default, they want to
make it possible for other

157
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,770
tools to integrate as well.

158
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,820
So everything that's done in
Chrome DevTools is done via an

159
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,930
open protocol, a network
protocol, that

160
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,120
anyone can plug in to.

161
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,620
And you see that a number
of IDEs are doing this.

162
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,060
From the JetBrains guys, to
Eclipse, to whatever, they all

163
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,500
now talk to the Chrome
debugging tools.

164
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,270
And basically, they can
use all the same

165
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,870
features that we add.

166
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,670
GREG SIMON: Certainly in the
short term, you're going to

167
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:33,620
see the team focus more on tools
to help you find and fix

168
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,020
jank and deal with memory, so.

169
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,270
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys.

170
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,960

171
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,980
AUDIENCE: Thank you for making
web faster with Chrome.

172
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,390
And my question is back
to WebView in Android.

173
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,460
Like once you make Chrome
default one, how [INAUDIBLE]

174
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,480

175
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,950
have a rapid release
cycle for that?

176
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,760
DARIN FISHER: Well, I will just
say that I think we are

177
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,460
all very interested in getting
to a point where the WebView

178
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,400
is something that could
be auto-updated.

179
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,820
It's the kind of thing that
definitely, that we dream and

180
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,010
imagine, wouldn't
that be nice?

181
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,040
So it's definitely the kind of
thing, you know, coming from

182
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,410
the Chrome team, this is
something that's very &mdash;

183
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,920
this is how we look
at software.

184
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,900
I mean, Chrome has this kind
of auto-update cycle.

185
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,920
It would make sense for the
WebView to have that as well.

186
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,340

187
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,015
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

188
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,130
I'm a release manager for
Firefox, so just full

189
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:29,910
transparency.

190
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,179
I'm really curious to know
about your releases, your

191
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,240
stability, and if there's
anything you're planning to do

192
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,090
to open up crash data for public
viewing, as a way that

193
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,010
we could maybe even know if
there's common crashes we're

194
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,055
experiencing on the
web in general.

195
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,300
It looks like you already
anonymize the data, so is that

196
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,900
something that you might
open up at some point?

197
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,870
And actually, a follow-up to
that is, I'm just curious if

198
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,020
the recent dip in Chrome
adoption, is

199
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,405
all related to stability?

200
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,590
Are there any opinions
on that?

201
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,430
JEFF CHANG: Hi, so first
of all, thank

202
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,620
you to Firefox for &mdash;

203
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,960
I think the fact that you guys
moved to a faster release

204
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,160
cycle is great for the web and
great for users in general.

205
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,950
On the crash data thing, I'll
definitely look into that.

206
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,870
I'll talk with our release
managers about that.

207
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,410
I actually had Adobe asking a
similar question recently, and

208
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,210
so we'll see what we can do.

209
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,650
And the last point, we actually
haven't seen any dip

210
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,158
in user adoption, so.

211
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:29,030

212
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,830
ERIK KAY: So one other
thing about that &mdash;

213
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,341
it turns out the crash data,
that even if you anonymize it,

214
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,990
it has personally identifiable
information in it.

215
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,590
It'll be a URL.

216
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,220
It'll be maybe form contents
of the page.

217
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,140
It'll be that sort of thing.

218
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,800
So actually, it turns out that
crash data is very sensitive.

219
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,740
It's not the sort of thing that
we can sort of easily

220
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,060
give out on that front.

221
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,180
The other big problem
with crash data is

222
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,520
that crashes are almost &mdash;

223
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,180
well, a large percentage of
crashes are a pointer to

224
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,060
potential security problems.

225
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,750
If there's a crash, that
probably means that there's

226
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,390
some exploit behind it, quite
often, I should say.

227
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,420
And that's another reason why
until we've tracked down the

228
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,900
source of that crash, we
probably can't make it public.

229
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,470
Now it's possible that things
like crash rates and stability

230
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,580
and changes on that front are
something that we could do, or

231
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,830
maybe even pointing at
modules or individual

232
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,480
areas of the product.

233
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,710
But in terms of actually getting
the crash data out

234
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,950
there and making it available,
I don't think that something

235
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,650
we'll be able to do.

236
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,930
GREG SIMON: Right, but like
pointing at SVG wouldn't

237
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,251
actually tell you anything
useful, right?

238
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:35,634
[LAUGHTER]

239
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:38,870

240
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,850
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about Netflix.

241
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,060
[LAUGHTER]

242
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,810
AUDIENCE: On the Chromebook
Pixel, which I've been using

243
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,160
for a while, the LTE version,
in the stable channel,

244
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,810
everything works great.

245
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,630
There are times I've noticed
that whenever the Pixel gets

246
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,970
hot, it'll downgrade the
CPU, and the video

247
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,940
quality will go down.

248
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,500
But what I don't understand is
in the developer and beta

249
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,310
version, the video quality is
really poor, regardless of the

250
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,990
bandwidth connection,
or regardless of

251
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,450
my settings on Netflix.

252
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,500
I've asked around while I've
been here, and I haven't been

253
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,390
able to find a clear-cut
answer of why.

254
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,610
I know whenever I'm using Chrome
on my Windows computer,

255
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:29,100
and I hit Shift-Control-Alt-S, I
have the ability to manually

256
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,680
select the speed at which
it's playing the video.

257
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,175
But I don't know a combination
on for Chrome OS.

258
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:42,940

259
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,200
But my goal in my question is,
how do I get my video quality

260
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,133
back up to HD?

261
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,820
[LAUGHTER]

262
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,190
DARIN FISHER: Well, I mean, I
don't know that we necessarily

263
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,480
have experts here who know
exactly all the details there.

264
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,740
So it's possible you're
just seeing a

265
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,190
bug in the beta channel.

266
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:09,560
It's also possible that you're
seeing the effects of the

267
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,500
changes to the player.

268
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,230
I'm not really sure.

269
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,030
I think we'd have
to look into it.

270
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,800
GREG SIMON: Yeah.

271
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,430
The other thing is, you
know, we have these

272
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,280
channels for a reason.

273
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,725
When I first got my first
Chromebook, I was living on

274
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:26,820
dev channel, and there were some
days where it just didn't

275
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,030
quite work at all.

276
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,640
So now I live on beta.

277
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,940
We do use these channels
to do experiments.

278
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,460
Well, at least the [INAUDIBLE]

279
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,630
in dev.

280
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,790
DARIN FISHER: I would really
encourage you to file a bug.

281
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,060
Actually, don't assume that
just because you're seeing

282
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,860
something that seems wrong in
beta channel, don't assume

283
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,700
that everybody else
is seeing it too.

284
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,750
So we really appreciate
bug reports.

285
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,326
AUDIENCE: Yes, I had one &mdash;

286
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:58,250
one was filed for me
earlier today.

287
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,780
DARIN FISHER: Excellent.

288
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,140
AUDIENCE: While I was
asking the question.

289
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,230
[LAUGHTER]

290
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

291
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,530
AUDIENCE: Quick question
about Bluetooth.

292
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,580
It's cool to see Chrome getting
Bluetooth support.

293
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,150
Is it also going to get
Bluetooth LE support?

294
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,050

295
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,760
ERIK KAY: I don't know
if anybody here is &mdash;

296
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,450
we don't have any Chrome
OS hardware guys here.

297
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,620
But I believe so.

298
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,670
I mean, I think that that's a
fairly new emerging standard,

299
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,820
and I know people who
are playing with it.

300
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,280
I just don't know what any
timeline or any products in

301
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,252
particular.

302
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:35,020
DARIN FISHER: Mention
Chrome [INAUDIBLE].

303
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,440
ERIK KAY: Oh yeah.

304
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,420
The reason Darin handed the mic
to me is that we do have

305
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,380
APIs, that we are part of Chrome
packaged apps, that

306
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,620
allow you to write apps to talk
to Bluetooth devices.

307
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:53,190
No LE support in there either,
but definitely, you can

308
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,980
integrate with hardware
from your apps.

309
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,140
AUDIENCE: Right.

310
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,870
And those APIs are actually
pretty good.

311
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,120
So thanks.

312
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,370
ERIK KAY: Thanks.

313
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,090

314
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,335
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

315
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:05,530
I had a question about
release cycles.

316
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,830
And I think that the rapid
release cycle that's been

317
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,840
adopted initially by Chrome and
kind of carried on to some

318
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,770
other browsers as well has
really accelerated the rate at

319
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,700
which we're seeing some great
new features show up.

320
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,530
The way we end up kind of
deciding what we feel safe

321
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,480
targeting now, because there is
still somewhat of a tail of

322
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,680
people &mdash; how long
it is varies &mdash;

323
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,600
who are on older versions of
assorted browsers, we kind of

324
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,635
pick features that we feel are
in the majority of browsers,

325
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:35,430
and then we look and see, OK,
how much can we fill in using

326
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,240
JavaScript?

327
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,390
And if we have to support
something really far back, how

328
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,650
much can we fill in by drinking
ourselves into a

329
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,900
stupor and pretending that
feature doesn't exist?

330
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,180
Do you think that going forward,
we're still going to

331
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,200
see the main way in which we get
new features for people on

332
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,380
older browsers is through
JavaScript fill-in?

333
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,560
Or do you think that there might
be some way we could

334
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,300
find a way to approximate
features outside of

335
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,450
JavaScript, and maybe something
natively supported

336
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,700
in the browser?

337
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,900

338
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,800
GREG SIMON: I mean, there are
some things that just can't be

339
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,500
polyfilled, right?

340
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,100
I mean, like we're doing a
project right now called the

341
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,240
Navigation Controller, which
involves a script running when

342
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,760
a URL request is made
in the browser.

343
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,070
I'm not sure exactly how to
polyfill that, so for that,

344
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,440
we're just going to actually
implement it, plant a flag.

345
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,950
But yeah.

346
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,890
ERIK KAY: I think if you took
a look at the work that the

347
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,080
Polymer team has done &mdash;

348
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,300
I used to be pretty skeptical
about polyfills.

349
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,340
I told them they were crazy to
try to polyfill Shadow DOM,

350
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,430
for example.

351
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,750
And I think they even agreed
with me when they were

352
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,770
trying to do it.

353
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,440
But yet somehow, they actually
managed to do it, and to get

354
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,030
pretty darn close.

355
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:55,190
And so I think JavaScript
polyfills are actually an

356
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,180
important way forward.

357
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,880
I'll toss out a plug for another
polyfill approach,

358
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,100
which can work with other
types of features.

359
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,950
Which is at least within Chrome,
we can experiment and

360
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,380
prototype new features
with Native Client.

361
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,260
So for example, one of the
things that Darin has pointed

362
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,210
out repeatedly is if in the
past, we had Native Client, we

363
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:24,080
might have been able to, say,
prototype Web SQL without

364
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,410
having to add it
to the browser.

365
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,720
And we would have learned quite
a bit about what people

366
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,510
thought about it, and probably
wouldn't have needed to have

367
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,980
implemented it to begin
with at that point.

368
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,230
So I think that when you have a
big pile of native code and

369
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,280
you want to use that as a way to
add features, we don't have

370
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,620
to worry about rewriting it from
scratch in JavaScript.

371
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,605
We can still do polyfills
that way as well.

372
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,930
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, I'll just
say that general issue

373
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,670
definitely encourages us to
focus on identifying the best

374
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,510
primitives, the simplest
primitives that we can add to

375
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,800
the platform, that give us the
most value-add that allows us

376
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,680
to make the polyfills
work well.

377
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,490
For example, there's
a lot of discussion

378
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,790
about pointer events.

379
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,730
And we have a polyfill for
pointer events, but it's

380
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,150
missing one little piece,
which is the

381
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,740
touch-action CSS property.

382
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,465
So instead of biting off the
whole pointer events spec up

383
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,240
front, we're focusing
just down on the

384
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,380
touch-action CSS property.

385
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,060
Because that's the thing that we
actually have to put in the

386
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,489
engine in order to make the
polyfill actually have you

387
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:21,140
full fidelity.

388
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,700
And once we do that, it turns
out separating that

389
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,695
touch-action CSS property is
actually generally useful.

390
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:28,569
It's useful outside of the
context of pointer events.

391
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:32,780
It's useful as a way to &mdash; well,
by the way, if you add a

392
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,940
touch event handler to your
page, you generally put the

393
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,480
browser in a slow path.

394
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,920
But the touch-action CSS
property lets you give the

395
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,280
browser a little more
information about this.

396
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,710
And so it's a useful property,
all by itself.

397
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,040
And so that whole idea of
focusing on primitives really,

398
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,680
really works out nicely,
I think.

399
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,030
It's worked out for things like
MDV, where we decided to

400
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,910
do mutation observers instead
of the full thing up front.

401
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,490
We added object.observe in a
similar fashion to help make

402
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,050
MDV work better, the
model-driven views, which is

403
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,295
leveraged by a polymer
quite extensively.

404
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,540
Don't know if you have anything
to add, Matt.

405
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,450
MATT MCNULTY: I was going to
bring up object.observe.

406
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,530
DARIN FISHER: Oh, I stole
your thunder.

407
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,620
AUDIENCE: Great, thank
you very much.

408
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,390
AUDIENCE: Hi, my question
is about scrolling.

409
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,560
And using Chrome on different
platforms &mdash;

410
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,790
like Mac, Linux, Windows,
and Android &mdash;

411
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,500
I notice there's kind of a big
gap in scrolling performance.

412
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,650
It's not always consistent.

413
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,300
It's not always as smooth as
it could be or perhaps as

414
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,977
other browsers are.

415
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:33,090
So I was curious, like how much
of that is under control

416
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,160
by the Chrome browser, and how
much is kind of determined by

417
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,780
the platform?

418
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,850
And maybe what areas are being
looked at, in terms of

419
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,080
scrolling performance.

420
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,190
VANGELIS KOKKEVIS: So a lot
of it is indeed us.

421
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,350
We are in this strange state
where we have a number of

422
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,430
architectures are evolving over
time, but they haven't

423
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,910
been fully pushed out in all
the platforms we have.

424
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,030
So for example, on Android,
we're sort of on the

425
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,290
cutting-edge scrolling
architecture, where we want to

426
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,460
be, which is heavily
multi-threaded.

427
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,630
And we can do a lot of work
outside the main thread.

428
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,650
And then if you go backwards,
Chrome OS is in sort of the

429
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,640
next step, and then Windows.

430
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,750
So we have threaded scrolling
on Windows, Chrome OS, and

431
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,820
Android with a slightly
different version.

432
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,950
And Mac is in a slightly
older model.

433
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,570
So our goal throughout the rest
of this year is really to

434
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,000
bring all the platforms at the
same point, and address

435
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,990
scrolling performance problems
once and for all.

436
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,900
GREG SIMON: If you have
questions about scrolling from

437
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,100
your own code, I strongly
encourage you to go see Nat

438
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,450
Duca and Tom Wiltzius' talk
from yesterday, called

439
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,740
"Jank--" What's it called?

440
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,800
It's got jank in the title.

441
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,630
DARIN FISHER: Go to
jankfree.org.

442
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,300
GREG SIMON: Yeah.

443
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:40,680
Yeah.

444
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,820
It's really, really good.

445
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,410
It'll explain exactly
how people

446
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,660
fall into these pitfalls.

447
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,780

448
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,430
AUDIENCE: My question
is about extensions

449
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,030
and their save data.

450
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,170
At the keynote, we heard about
the possibility of Android

451
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,660
being able to save the data
from device to device.

452
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,750
But with Chrome, whenever I sign
into a new machine, it

453
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,290
downloads all my extensions,
which is great.

454
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,530
But all my preferences
don't come over.

455
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,220
Is there something that would
allow kind of the same way

456
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,040
that Android does that, so that
those preferences would

457
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,710
go into Chrome and then
travel with me?

458
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,840
Or is that sort of on the
extension developer's end?

459
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,208
ERIK KAY: So we were
there first.

460
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,870
[LAUGHTER]

461
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,910
ERIK KAY: No, seriously, a year
ago, we added an API to

462
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,770
Extensions called Chrome
Storage Sync.

463
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,360
And it's really simple.

464
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,060
It's key value, very similar to
local storage, but async.

465
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,790
And it uses the Chrome
sync engine.

466
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,060
So it's a great way to store
settings and preferences, and

467
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,370
we encourage all extensions
and apps to use it.

468
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,210
Within Packaged we, also have
another sync mechanism called

469
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,670
sync file system.

470
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,100
Sync file system allows you to
use things like documents and

471
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,390
media files and that sort of
thing, and to easily do

472
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,740
file-based synchronization
across machines.

473
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,460
And it uses your Drive
account to do that.

474
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,440
And so with apps, not only do
you bring your settings and

475
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,690
your state with you, but you can
also bring your documents

476
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,260
with you wherever you go, so
that those will be synced

477
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,870
offline automatically, without
you as the app developer

478
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,890
having to build any server
infrastructure at all.

479
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,610
So the tools are all there.

480
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,480
But because they weren't there
from day one, what you'll find

481
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,340
is that there are some older
extensions, or perhaps

482
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,800
extension authors who just
aren't aware of the feature,

483
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,930
who haven't done it.

484
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,170
And so definitely just bug your
favorite extension author

485
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,390
to add the feature.

486
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,774
It's really easy.

487
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:36,024
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

488
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:39,420

489
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

490
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,650
I'd like to know if you have
any plans on releasing a

491
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,350
64-bit version for Mac.

492
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,370
Just because of Java,
and you know.

493
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,035
JEFF CHANG: Yep, we're
working on it.

494
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:58,360
[LAUGHTER]

495
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,750
ERIK KAY: Yeah, It's hard to
get all the things right,

496
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,770
particularly with plug-ins.

497
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,440
I mean I think on
Mac, it's more

498
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,170
straightforward than others.

499
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,250
But on Windows, for those of you
who would ask the obvious

500
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,220
following question, it turns
out it's a much harder

501
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,000
problem, because most
plug-ins are 32-bit.

502
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,910
And so you have to do this
32-to-64-bit bridge.

503
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,960
And anyway, there's a lot of
other fun, interesting things.

504
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,670
JEFF CHANG: Yeah, I mean, I'm
not just giving lip service.

505
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,390
We are actually working on it.

506
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,980
I exchanged an email with
Adobe in the last week.

507
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,340
We're working on it for
Flash, as well.

508
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,460
And so it's definitely actively
being worked on by

509
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,174
engineers on our team.

510
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:36,030
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

511
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,120
DARIN FISHER: And there's a
lot of excitement on the

512
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
Chrome team for 64-bit.

513
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,200
It allows us to improve
security.

514
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,860
it allows us to improve
performance in some

515
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,190
respects, for sure.

516
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,710
Also, though, there's the risk
of hurting performance because

517
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,980
we end up using more memory.

518
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,760
Things are just, they end up
taking up more space because

519
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,960
they're 64-bit pointers
and so on.

520
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,210
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

521
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,010

522
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,660
AUDIENCE: Yes, I used
to use Netscape.

523
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,960
Anybody remember that?

524
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,370
[LAUGHTER]

525
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,900
AUDIENCE: And it became a kind
of slow and bloated over time,

526
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,420
and I switched to Phoenix, which
became Firebird, which

527
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,280
became Firefox.

528
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,960
And that became kind of overly
large and bloated over time,

529
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,850
and so I switched to Chrome.

530
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,770
And over the past few months,
I've noticed, especially with

531
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,040
lots of tabs &mdash;

532
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,610
I keep dozens of them open &mdash;

533
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,140
it's been getting slower
and slower.

534
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,670
And I'm wondering what
steps that you'll

535
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,890
take in general to &mdash;

536
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,410
as computers become faster,
there's a tendency to optimize

537
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,560
for the current, whatever
the newest one is.

538
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,500
What steps do you take to make
sure it doesn't become slower

539
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,060
and slower and more bloated
on existing computers?

540
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:04,980

541
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,380
LARS BAK: I'll go first.

542
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,284
I used to work on V8 team.

543
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:13,240
And I think we did a good job in
making performance better,

544
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,160
and that translates to
old machines, too.

545
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,970
If you had an old machine, it
will run faster with a better

546
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,280
[INAUDIBLE] engine.

547
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,280
But at the same time, we spend
a lot of time profiling

548
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,130
applications and reducing memory
footprint by tuning the

549
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,230
garbage collector so the total
footprint for the app would

550
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,100
stay minimal.

551
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,370
Again, we are not the only ones
at fault here, right?

552
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,300
Because the application
developers, they also put in

553
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,210
code in the browser that
allocates objects.

554
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,720
And of course, when they get
more modern machines, they

555
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,670
write more code and
it penalizes the

556
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,480
people using the browser.

557
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,290
So certainly, we are trying all
the time to minimize the

558
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,080
amount of memory
used by a tab.

559
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,080
But in some cases,
it's very hard.

560
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,670
Because when you have
[INAUDIBLE], it's used by the

561
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,925
application as well.

562
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:07,390
GREG SIMON: Yeah, I mean,
there is more than one

563
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,780
contributing factor
to this, right?

564
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:15,010
I mean, there's just &mdash; there is
content you load that just

565
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,720
runs in the background,
and you don't know

566
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,880
it's running, et cetera.

567
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,780
And we aren't prioritizing
the processes, et cetera.

568
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,670
There are many, many
micro-benchmarks that we

569
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,120
monitor with every build
of Chrome, et cetera.

570
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,680
But sometimes, some piece of
content comes down that

571
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,010
tickles it in a certain
way that we

572
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,230
weren't actually measuring.

573
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,280
And so there are certainly areas
that we can improve, and

574
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,290
we are working on improving
right now in the area of

575
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:47,410
shared workers and threads
and things like that.

576
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,110
ERIK KAY: So the old story we
say, and some of you may have

577
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,870
heard us tell this
story before &mdash;

578
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,470
I thought Darin was going to go
with this, so I'll step on

579
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,130
that one for him.

580
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,250
When we started Chrome, when
Darin and Ben first got the

581
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,460
first version of Chrome up and
running &mdash; and when I say first

582
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,060
version of Chrome, I mean like
no UI, just rendering a web

583
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,660
page really literally.

584
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,980
Come on, it had grey
squares for tabs.

585
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,000
ERIK KAY: OK, grey
squares for tabs.

586
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,960
So basically, people said,
well, you know what?

587
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,800
From today on, this won't
get any faster.

588
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,080
Because from now on,
we're just going

589
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,600
to be adding features.

590
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,450
And as you say, features,
it's bloat, right?

591
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,030
It just can't help but
slow things down.

592
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,980
And so how do we prevent that?

593
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,500
How do we keep it as fast
as it feels right now?

594
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,420
And the idea was that, well,
let's create a performance

595
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,120
benchmarks now, before
we add any features.

596
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,850
And let's not regress that.

597
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,320
Let's promise ourselves that
we will not regress those

598
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,410
benchmarks.

599
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,040
And so start-up performance
was a big one.

600
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,660
We wanted that to be
instantaneous.

601
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,430
We have a page cycler benchmark
from the early days

602
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,370
that also, we were very
religious about.

603
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:05,500
And so when every check-in,
effectively every check-in, we

604
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,950
run those tests.

605
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,990
And when there's a very
small regression,

606
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,750
we revert that change.

607
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,380
So even something as small
as 10 milliseconds, 20

608
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,240
milliseconds, that's grounds
for giving reverted.

609
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,730
Because those small regressions
add up over time.

610
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,100
Now every now and again, you
would look at something, and a

611
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,730
feature landed, and it caused
a regression, and you could

612
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,520
totally understand why it caused
a regression, but it

613
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,020
was for a really good reason.

614
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,870
And so the good news is that
by measuring it so

615
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,150
consistently, you could make
informed trade-offs.

616
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,800
There are times where you're
willing to take a small

617
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,150
performance hit to land
a particular feature.

618
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,480
But because we're religious
about measuring it all along

619
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,220
the way, we could make those
as informed decisions.

620
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,310
I think the last bit that I just
want to reinforce from

621
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,390
what these guys are saying is
that in some ways, we're a

622
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,030
victim of all the cool
performance and features we've

623
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,560
been adding.

624
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,090
That by making JavaScript
amazingly faster, and by

625
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:06,680
adding WebGL and whatever, that
people are now writing

626
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,960
more complex web pages.

627
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,720
That even the most basic things
that you were doing

628
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,800
before, people are doing
cooler stuff with it.

629
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,550
And so those 20 tabs that you
have open today are actually

630
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,790
doing a lot more than they were
just a few years ago.

631
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,320
And so that's part of it.

632
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,790
But I want to be clear, though,

633
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,780
that we're not perfect.

634
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,930
We do have regressions.

635
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,000
We do have things that happen.

636
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,610
And one of the things that we're
concerned about over

637
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,050
time is that there are things
that just happen because

638
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,170
people's profiles get big,
because their history ages,

639
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,130
because they install
more stuff.

640
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,400
And those are things that are
hard to test up front.

641
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,065
They're hard to test in the lab,
and hard to reproduce.

642
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:45,910
And so to catch those,
we tried to do field

643
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,640
measurements, and get aggregate
statistics, and look

644
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,840
for regressions in the
field on that front.

645
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,340
But some of these things, even
still, are hard to track down.

646
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,980
And so if you've got specific
things or specific pages or

647
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,360
whatever that you think are
just noticeably worse, or

648
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,400
scenarios that are noticeably
worse, please file a bug.

649
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,240
We take performance
very seriously.

650
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,275
It's really our number-one
concern.

651
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:11,420
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: Yeah, I just
add, just briefly on top

652
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,930
of that, there's definitely
those two

653
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,920
halves to the equation.

654
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,760
There's the sites that we're
loading that have changed over

655
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,260
time and gotten bigger, and so
that's where things like SPDY,

656
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,330
WebP, and other things, we hope
will speed things up a

657
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,220
little bit and get some of
that performance back.

658
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,570
And also, those usage cases
have changed over time.

659
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,480
And so we've been recently
looking at rebalancing some of

660
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,080
the code that sort of
better reflects

661
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,260
most typical use cases.

662
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,110
And I think page load time got
about 5%, something around 5%

663
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,530
faster just recently, because
we went and re-architected a

664
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,240
few things to recognize
these scenarios.

665
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,090
So there's still a lot more that
we can do, and those sort

666
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:53,760
of heuristics.

667
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,490
And also trying to get more
code out of the way at

668
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,410
start-up, and get rid of some of
that bloat that's crept in.

669
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,930
But there is also that &mdash; using
WebP and other similar

670
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,320
techniques to reduce
the load so you can

671
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,150
have more tabs open.

672
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,980
So hopefully, we'll continue to
see improvements over the

673
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,966
months to come.

674
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:17,550
GREG SIMON: Yeah, I mean, there
are so many performance

675
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,890
metrics that we measure now that
it became too much for a

676
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,330
human to actually read.

677
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,150
So earlier in the year, we
borrowed some signal

678
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:32,050
processing code from Google
Search, I guess.

679
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,330
Sure.

680
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,620
To actually go through and watch
it all, and then to send

681
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,960
us alerts when it happens.

682
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,230
Because it just became
too much.

683
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,560
We really care about it a lot.

684
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,470
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: We very
nearly had a screenshot for

685
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,790
the keynote, and it got cut at
the last minute, that showed

686
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,540
one of the performance
dashboards that was 100

687
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,820
different charts that monitored
all these different

688
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,290
things, and some of the
alerts that went on.

689
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:53,850
It's gone.

690
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,300
It's very, very complicated to
look at these performance

691
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,770
scenarios, but we'll
keep working on it.

692
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,360
VANGELIS KOKKEVIS: And I also
think it's worth mentioning

693
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,630
that the way that technology
is moving in general, it

694
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,110
forces us to go and rethink some
of the core architecture

695
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,570
principles that we've had.

696
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,660
Because now instead of having
the 8, 12, 30-core machines,

697
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,220
we're dealing with mobile
devices with a lot more

698
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,120
constraints.

699
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,340
So a lot of the architecture
decisions we are making are to

700
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,600
address lower-bar devices.

701
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,580
And so as a side effect of that,
we're going to get older

702
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,926
PCs to become faster as well.

703
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:27,210
ERIK KAY: By the way, in case
it isn't obvious from the

704
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,930
number of people who wanted to
chime in on this one, we care

705
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,170
a lot about performance.

706
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,540
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: Performance
and security.

707
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,390
But we should probably &mdash;

708
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,150
I'm sorry.

709
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,180
DARIN FISHER: I was going
to pile on with

710
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,750
what Erik just said.

711
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:38,900
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: OK.

712
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,780
I was going to try
and move us on.

713
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,310
I'm watching that clock
count down.

714
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,810
OK, let's go to the next one.

715
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,260
Thanks.

716
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,370
AUDIENCE: Hopefully this
is a quick one.

717
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,820
My question's about Flash.

718
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,260
Chrome is kind of unique in
that Flash is bundled and

719
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,720
updated through the browser.

720
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,940
I was curious how that
partnership with Adobe works,

721
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,140
and also if you see that as
continuing long-term or if

722
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,050
Flash might be phased
out in the future.

723
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,950
JEFF CHANG: So I can't comment
on the business partnership,

724
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:04,280
but we definitely enjoy working
with Adobe to one, as

725
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,530
you say, build in Flash into
Chrome, so that you get it

726
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,140
right off the bat.

727
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,750
You never have to worry
about installing it.

728
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,585
And two, the kind of bigger
reason we did that was so that

729
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:14,375
we could work directly with them
to get Flash inside of

730
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,170
Chrome Sandbox.

731
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,970
And so we're very happy that on
Windows and Mac and Chrome

732
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,760
OS, Flash is actually running
inside of Chrome Sandbox.

733
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,600
And so when you see news about
all these exploits, and people

734
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,830
getting pwned through Flash,
we've been happy that Chrome

735
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,910
users are protected even more
through that Sandbox.

736
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,090
And so because we take security
so seriously, yes, we

737
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,460
will definitely keep
doing that.

738
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,710
DARIN FISHER: Yeah, and just to
put that into perspective,

739
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,730
I mean, the amount of security
bugs that we

740
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,980
encounter in Blink &mdash;

741
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,450
it's ongoing.

742
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,460
The Sandbox is really the best
mitigation we have, as well as

743
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,170
our rapid auto-update,
to keep users safe.

744
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,110
Code is complicated.

745
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,830
It's easy to write bugs
that can be exploited.

746
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,670
And so we need belts
and suspenders.

747
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,010
We need ways to protect users.

748
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,280
And so getting Flash not just
in the Sandbox, but onto our

749
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,160
auto-update train means that we
can help provide users with

750
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,240
the best experience, and a
very secure experience.

751
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,810
JEFF CHANG: Yeah, I forgot to
mention the auto-update part.

752
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,480
So every time a new Flash
version comes out, you get it

753
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,120
in Chrome automatically.

754
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,525
You don't have to
worry about it.

755
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:23,120
AUDIENCE: Go to this side.

756
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,650
AUDIENCE: Hi, everybody.

757
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,810
One of the problems I have is
when I have a lot of tabs

758
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,460
open, the individual tab items
themselves get very, very

759
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,320
small and kind of hard
to work with.

760
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,940
it used to be possible to have
vertical tabs in Chrome, and I

761
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,030
was wondering, what are your
thoughts on vertical tabs, and

762
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,180
will we ever see them again?

763
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,860
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: Jeff.

764
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,260
[LAUGHTER]

765
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,390
DARIN FISHER: We can
all look at Jeff &mdash;

766
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,100
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: Yeah,
come on, Jeff.

767
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,550
DARIN FISHER: He was PM
for Chrome front ends.

768
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,030
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: He's backing
away from the stage.

769
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,120
JEFF CHANG: Yeah, yeah, OK.

770
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,060
And now I have another data
point, another request.

771
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,710
So I'll keep it in mind.

772
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,700
DARIN FISHER: It's been
one of these long &mdash;

773
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,040
things we've always talked
about, how to

774
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,950
manage more tabs better.

775
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,560
It's a very challenging topic.

776
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,300
ERIK KAY: We do have a wacky
idea, if you're interested in

777
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,830
hearing that.

778
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,120
A wacky idea is to provide an
extension API to just hide

779
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,550
tabs, to make them so they're
not even visible.

780
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,510
And then to give extension
authors the ability to create

781
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,820
their own UI surface for them.

782
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,830
I don't know if we'll actually
get around to doing something

783
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,472
like that, but it was
one wacky idea.

784
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:20,340
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

785
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,630
AUDIENCE: My question's
regarding extensions for

786
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,980
Chrome, and is there any
plan to bring that

787
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,719
to Chrome for Android?

788
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,659
ERIK KAY: It's something
we've explored.

789
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,710
It's hard on a lot of front.

790
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:39,440
First off, as Vangelis pointed
out earlier, Android phones in

791
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,889
particular, I should
say, are very

792
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,780
constrained devices, right?

793
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,210
And so right now, we're
trying to make Chrome

794
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,360
as small as we can.

795
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,159
And so we're stripping as much
out as we can and still

796
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,060
keeping it functional.

797
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,030
And so we're not quite ready to
say that it's time to add

798
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,370
more features back
in quite yet.

799
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,180
But we're experimenting
with it internally.

800
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,410
And I think the other big
concern to think about with

801
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:07,670
extensions on mobile is mobile
is very different on a few

802
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,230
fronts that don't really
work all that well with

803
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,230
the model we've got.

804
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,550
So first off, there's different
UI surfaces.

805
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,740
There's a much smaller amount
of screen real estate.

806
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:23,630
Secondly, in these mobile
environments, things are

807
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,860
killed off all the time.

808
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,130
The browser doesn't
keep running.

809
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,490
When you switch to another
app, it's gone.

810
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,000
And one of the nice things about
extensions were things

811
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,850
that keep running and they
keep doing their thing.

812
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,940
So I think that there
are some challenges.

813
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,470
That even when we want to do it,
the experiments we've done

814
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,750
are just trying to figure
out how to make

815
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,900
it even make sense.

816
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,110
So even if we do it, it's likely
to be something that's

817
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,870
not 100% compatible with what
we're doing on the desktop.

818
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,485
That would be a different
beast altogether.

819
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:54,007

820
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:55,450
AUDIENCE: Hello.

821
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,590
I was curious about how you've
been using all the anonymous

822
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,270
user usage data you've
been getting from us.

823
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,560
How to make the product better,
the Chrome browser?

824
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,460
JEFF CHANG: Yeah, so you're
talking about, when you

825
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,020
install Chrome, there's an
option to opt in to anonymous

826
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,030
usage statistics.

827
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,920
And that's like button clicks
and things, and crash reports,

828
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,670
and stuff like that when
you're using features.

829
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,980
And yeah, we look at that
stuff all the time.

830
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,080
And recently, we've actually
improved upon that system.

831
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,160
I think we blogged about it.

832
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,580
But we have, basically, an
experimental system by which

833
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,770
we can push out different
versions of features to

834
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,715
different buckets of users.

835
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:32,690
So we do live A/B experiments
through

836
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,110
our auto-update system.

837
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,362
And then we can say, oh &mdash;

838
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,100
a trivial example, you know &mdash;

839
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,060
this many people clicked on
version A of the button versus

840
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,700
version B of the button
versus version C of

841
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,520
the button or whatever.

842
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,500
And we can compare metrics like
stability and feature

843
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,900
usage and retention of Chrome
users and stuff like that.

844
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,200
And then we can decide which
one we want to go with.

845
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,800
Of course, it doesn't make all
of our decisions for us.

846
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,590
We take the combination of the
data and our intuition and

847
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,100
stuff like that to decide
what to do.

848
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,131
But yeah, we definitely
look at that.

849
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,820
The other thing I should mention
is we only put in

850
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,110
stats for things &mdash;

851
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,050
we have to decide what to
measure, and then put in the

852
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,820
stats for it, and then
decide what to do.

853
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,480
So it's not like we're just
collecting random stats

854
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,550
everywhere.

855
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,040
GREG SIMON: We can also
use it to do &mdash; sorry.

856
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,590
We can also use it to do really
short experiments.

857
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,785
One of my favorite examples of
this was one of the folks on

858
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:25,520
the team couldn't figure out, by
reading MSDN, what the max

859
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,640
file path length was.

860
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,560
He got at least two, maybe
three different answers.

861
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,090
But this is something that you
actually want to get right,

862
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,485
because it can lead to
strings that are out

863
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:37,190
of bounds, et cetera.

864
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,660
So he checked in an experiment
for like 24 hours and got the

865
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,370
decisive answer for it.

866
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,160
And then took the
actual code out.

867
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,310
All done in the open.

868
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,070
DARIN FISHER: I mean, there's
just been countless examples

869
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,950
of tuning Chrome by
using this system.

870
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,600
I mean, one of the classic
examples was figuring out how

871
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,310
many parallel TCP connections
to open per origin.

872
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,340
I mean, today, it's six, but it
used to be that the typical

873
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,000
number was four.

874
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,120
This spec says two.

875
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,720
I mean, what do you
choose, right?

876
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,570
And so by making adjustments and
measuring and looking at

877
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,750
the statistical data we get
back, we can make informed

878
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,020
decisions, and that'll make
a faster product.

879
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,020
The number that I think Ian
quoted, on 5% page load

880
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,440
performance, that kind of stuff
gets validated using

881
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,790
that anonymous usage data.

882
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,700
ERIK KAY: I think crash reports
are probably the most

883
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,790
useful, far and away.

884
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,860
I mean, what we use it for is
a quick stability check for

885
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,470
us, especially with Canary
and dev channel.

886
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,450
What we can see is release over
release, we have a stat

887
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,980
which we look at as crash
per million page views.

888
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,220
Crashes per million
page views.

889
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,040
And we can look at it by
different process type and

890
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,750
that sort of thing.

891
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,710
And so looking at that over
time, you can see when one

892
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,900
release is dramatically less
stable than another, and then

893
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,920
have somebody drill in.

894
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,970
So it sets off alarms.

895
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,830
And so we have as a metric, we
talked about wanting to drive

896
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,180
performance numbers down.

897
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,090
We also &mdash;

898
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:02,250
there's a fourth S that Linus
didn't mention in the keynote,

899
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,840
which is stability, as well,
that we take very seriously.

900
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,530
And we're always trying to drive
that crash per million

901
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,980
number down for all the

902
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,570
processes, for all the platforms.

903
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,200
And so that's another incredibly
useful bit of data.

904
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,160
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: I see that
clock counting down ominously.

905
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,740
I think we've probably got time
for one more question,

906
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,900
and then we'll take questions
outside, if

907
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,970
anyone can hang around.

908
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,500
AUDIENCE: Chrome OS Sync
FileSystem seems to be backed

909
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,720
only by Google Drive
right now.

910
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,540
Are there any plans to make that
pluggable for something

911
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,330
like Dropbox to be the data
store, economical cloud data

912
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,720
store for our Chrome
OS device?

913
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,170
ERIK KAY: We'd love to do it.

914
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,300
We're starting off with one
use case first, and really

915
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,680
trying to make sure
we nail it.

916
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,120
But yes, we'd love to make it
so that's more pluggable.

917
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,410
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: All right,
I see the last 10 seconds.

918
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,270
I'll take this as
an opportunity

919
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,200
just to thank everybody.

920
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,670
First, for coming to I/O, coming
to this session, and

921
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,320
asking such fantastic
questions.

922
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,650
I really appreciate it.

923
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,030
So give yourselves a hand
for great questions.

924
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:01,570
[APPLAUSE]

925
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,230
IAN ELLISON-TAYLOR: And we'll
maybe see some of you outside

926
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,870
if we didn't get
to answer them.

927
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,120
All right.

928
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:12,622
