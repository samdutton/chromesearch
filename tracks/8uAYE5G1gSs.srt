00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,101
COLT MCANLIS: Hello everyone.

3
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:04,290
Oh, come on guys.

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,680
Look up from your pixels.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,610
Let's try this again.

6
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,860
Hello everyone.

7
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,620
AUDIENCE: Hello.

8
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,700
COLT MCANLIS: All right.

9
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,750
That's the type of pre-lunch
enthusiasm I

10
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,950
would expect on a Thursday.

11
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,140
I can't see all of your
hangovers, that's good.

12
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,910
All right, hello everyone.

13
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,380
My name is Colt McAnlis.

14
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,190
I'm a developer advocate at
Google working on Chrome.

15
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,060
And joining me today is the
amazingly talented Grace

16
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,720
Kloba, who happens to be
the technical lead

17
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,660
on Chrome for Android.

18
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,630
So all of the cool Chrome on
mobile questions can go to her

19
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,600
after the talk.

20
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,800
But if you have questions
about my shirt,

21
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,330
that come to me.

22
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,190
What we're here today to talk
to you about is how to

23
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,510
supercharge your websites, both
on mobile and on desktop,

24
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,410
with the help of using the
GPU and a lot of amazing

25
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,050
intrinsics that we've put
inside of Chrome.

26
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,660
Quick show of hands, how many
of you attended the Jank

27
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,140
Busters talk yesterday?

28
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,260
Awesome, that's a good set.

29
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,060
That's a good set.

30
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,970
You can view the content that
we're going to talk about

31
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,100
today as a pairing of what Nat
talked about yesterday.

32
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,790
Today we're going to talk about
how to use the GPU to

33
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,110
get awesome stuff done.

34
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,280
Now before we begin, I want
to point you all to this

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,810
beautiful perfmatters hashtag.

36
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,550
Quick show of hands, how many
of you have seen this on the

37
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,370
interwebs so far?

38
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,000
You all are my favorite
people.

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,590
Hugs for everyone after that.

40
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,840
Come find me later.

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,980
If you see something today
that inspires you, some

42
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,150
statistic you didn't know, or
some cool technique that you

43
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,300
haven't heard of before, please
feel free to go to your

44
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,040
social media outlet
of choice and use

45
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,350
the perfmatters hashtag.

46
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,080
Spread the word.

47
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,720
Spread the love.

48
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,690
That's what we're all here
at Google to do.

49
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,180
I'll quit wasting time
at this point.

50
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,630
Let's dig into it.

51
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,720
Before we can talk about how the
GPU is used to supercharge

52
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,640
your website into awesome town,
we first need to start

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,430
with a little bit of history so
that you can understand how

54
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,750
Chrome actually draws
your web page.

55
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,750
It all starts at the top with
a very complex series of

56
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,510
algorithms known as software
rasterization.

57
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,110
Effectively, this suite of
tools, or algorithms and

58
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,940
computation, is responsible
for taking a high-order

59
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,570
primitive, like this beautiful
little glyph we have here,

60
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,970
subdividing it into
boundary pixels.

61
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,750
And then finally, adding
color to it and

62
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,070
pushing it to your screen.

63
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,120
So we can actually subdivide it,
add some color to it, and

64
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,090
you can see that this is
programmer art, so, of course,

65
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,590
my at symbol is very,
very pixelated.

66
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,010
Now Chrome will use this
concept of software

67
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,870
rasterization as your
page is loaded.

68
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,020
Chrome loads your page.

69
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,260
It'll actually go through and
software rasterize everything

70
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,080
you see, so all of the glyphs
that you see, your images, the

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,050
small text, the lines on the
screen, the borders, the

72
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,070
rounded edges, the
drop shadows.

73
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,460
This is all being pushed
through the software

74
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,870
rasterization path into
a single large bitmap.

75
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,790
And then what happens is, as you
scroll, what Chrome will

76
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,670
do is it'll do the smart thing
and it'll actually go through

77
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,770
a series of memory copy
operations and effectively

78
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,750
take all of those lines, the
scan lines in the bitmap, and

79
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,670
mem copy them to a position
that's higher in the bitmap.

80
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,030
And then it'll go back through
and only software rasterize

81
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,810
what hasn't been seen
on the page.

82
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,990
This, of course, means
that Chrome is

83
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,910
doing the smart thing.

84
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,560
It's not spending all of its
time software rasterizing divs

85
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,970
as they're positioned
on the page.

86
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,610
It's only updating what is
new and what is awesome.

87
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,690
GRACE KLOBA: So it's
2013, right?

88
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,900
Most of the sites has animation,
transition, to make

89
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,170
it look good.

90
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,210
So what is animation?

91
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,350
It's essentially bits update
to the screen constantly to

92
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,360
make it feel like a movie.

93
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,900
So let's take a look
at this example.

94
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,590
We have this rubber duck
animated through the river to

95
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,690
the other side.

96
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,820
So for every frame, we
have to move the

97
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,180
duck to a new location.

98
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,630
This means for every frame, we
have to paint to the duck in

99
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,930
the new location with
a new background.

100
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,650
And then go back to where
the duck used to be and

101
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,880
then erase the duck.

102
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,680
And [INAUDIBLE]

103
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,680
just clean background.

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,030
Essentially, for every
frame, we have to

105
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,490
paint these two regions.

106
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,700
And there's a new trend,
the retina display.

107
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,310
So it makes the display look
pretty because it doubles the

108
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,610
screen resolution, which
quadruples the number of the

109
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,390
pixels pushed onto the screen.

110
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,980
So Colt mentioned earlier during
the scrolling for every

111
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,470
frame we do a mem copy.

112
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,190
That's not free.

113
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,040
It's even not cheap with the
retina display because we're

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,140
pushing quadruple number of the
pixel to the screen while

115
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,992
the memory bus speed
hasn't caught up.

116
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:34,320
And in the animation case, for
every frame we have to paint

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,630
the two regions.

118
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,720
So now that region is quadruple
the size, which

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,730
means a much longer
paint times.

120
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,320
So if we look at the chart,
the number keep going up.

121
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,430
It's not coming down anytime
soon, at least I was not told.

122
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,040
So Colt, what do we do?

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,390
COLT MCANLIS: Well, you see,
because these things keep

124
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,420
getting larger and larger and
larger, we have to take

125
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,640
advantage of the hardware that's
resident on the system.

126
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,860
So everyone should have
pixels by now.

127
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,890
I see most of you
typing on them.

128
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,400
And everyone should have one
of these beautiful little

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,710
phones in your pocket as well.

130
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,040
All of these contain one common
element, is they have a

131
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,790
new piece of hardware &mdash; well,
an old piece of hardware

132
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,120
really &mdash; called a graphics
processing unit, or a GPU.

133
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,160
Now, GPUs were actually created
in the mid to late

134
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,080
'90s to effectively help with
a concept of software

135
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,910
rasterization needed for
games and boring

136
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,600
stuff like CAD software.

137
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,390
Effectively, architects came
together and created dedicated

138
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,780
hardware to do software
rasterization.

139
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,110
And then we started calling
it hardware

140
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,920
rasterization after that.

141
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,760
These GPUs super excel at doing
software rasterization.

142
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,250
They are amazingly capable
to push pixels

143
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:38,910
around on the screen.

144
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,030
They do it better than anything
else we have out on

145
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,230
the market today.

146
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,240
So the cool thing is that if the
GPU is actually the best

147
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,890
at moving pixels and doing
software rasterization, the

148
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,070
question for Chrome is, how do
we utilize this piece of

149
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,420
hardware to make your webpages
render faster?

150
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,640
Now, as we already talked about,
you can look at our

151
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,000
upload diagram in a hierarchical
view of this.

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,670
So we start with our
page layout.

153
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,070
And that, of course, is
rasterized by the CPU.

154
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,850
Then every frame that you make
small updates, the CPU is

155
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,830
responsible for updating
and presenting those

156
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,310
pixels to the screen.

157
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,560
Now this means that there's a
lot of work going on in the

158
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,990
CPU as you do small scrolls,
big scrolls, and then

159
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,610
animations over the page.

160
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,330
Because of the fact of that
the GPU is actually really

161
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,200
good at pushing pixels, it makes
sense then that we can

162
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,700
insert the GPU between the CPU
and the actual monitor.

163
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,940
So this means that the CPU can
do a single upload the GPU and

164
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,800
allow the GPU to handle
finalized positioning on the

165
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,230
screen on your behalf.

166
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,570
This reduces the overall amount
of CPU work that has to

167
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,790
be done rendering your
pages a lot faster.

168
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,014
Clicky.

169
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:42,300
Ah, there we go.

170
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,830
GRACE KLOBA: So recalling the
CPU mode, we allocate one big

171
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,340
bitmap to cover the entire
visible regions.

172
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,990
In the GPU mode, we divided the
page into smaller tiles.

173
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,810
And each tile is cached in the
GPU memory as a texture.

174
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,350
So let's reexamine the case
where we scroll the page.

175
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,250
When the page is first loaded,
we allocate enough number of

176
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,120
the tiles to cover the
visible areas.

177
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,990
And then when the page is
scrolling down, some of the

178
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,560
tiles from the previous frame
are still visible.

179
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,640
But they are drawn in a
different position relative to

180
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,350
the window of the screen.

181
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,480
So one key difference
here is we can't

182
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,220
read off the mem copy.

183
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,870
So retina display, nice and
we are fine with it.

184
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,540
Similar as a software rendering
mode, there will be

185
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,790
new content to show.

186
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,430
And then we just allocate the
new tiles, render them in the

187
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,260
CPU, and upload them to
the GPU textures.

188
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,120
Some of the old tiles from
the previous frame

189
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,080
now they are invisible.

190
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,470
If there's enough GPU memory,
we leave them in the cache.

191
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,710
So if the page is scrolling up,
they will be visible and

192
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,090
we have them right away.

193
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,940
There's no need to
do a CPU paint.

194
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,420
If you continue scrolling down,
at some point we're

195
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,590
going to run out
of GPU memory.

196
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,360
What happens is we go back to
the oldest tiles, which user

197
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,920
hasn't seen for a while,
and we recycle them.

198
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,560
This means if those tiles will
be visible again, we have to

199
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,800
go back to the CPU to paint them
and upload them to the

200
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,950
GPU texture.

201
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,480
So the amount of the GPU memory
available is really

202
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,980
device dependent.

203
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,530
The goal for us is to keep as
much as possible in the GPU

204
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,970
memory, so when user interacting
with a page, we

205
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,860
can avoid going to
the CPU to paint.

206
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,480
Before we move on to the next
topic, I want to mention,

207
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,140
Chrome can also do
pre-painting.

208
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,330
So earlier, I mentioned when the
page is the first loaded

209
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,790
Chrome allocates enough tiles
for the visible areas.

210
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,600
During the idle cycle, we
proactively paint the area

211
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,100
just outside of the
visible region.

212
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,290
And this prediction also
is gesture aware.

213
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,970
So for example, if you're
scrolling down a page, the

214
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,240
pre-paint will pre-paint the
area below the current visible

215
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,550
area because that's the
direction going.

216
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,100

217
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,060
COLT MCANLIS: So this is really
cool for scrolling, but

218
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,860
it actually puts us in a little
bit of a bind when we

219
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,140
start talking about
the same duck

220
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,500
animation as we saw before.

221
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,920
By the way, ducks should be
the new animation thing in

222
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,210
presentations, in my
personal opinion.

223
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,050
I'm going to start
this movement.

224
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,090
Too many people put cats
in their slides.

225
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,073
I really think ducks are ready
for a comeback, especially if

226
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:44,330
you've ever been bitten
by a duck.

227
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,050
Actually it hurts a lot.

228
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,700
Anyhow, as we have the duck &mdash;

229
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,530
that's my aside, right?

230
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:48,980
We got time.

231
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,620
We got plenty of time.

232
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,460
Story time with Colt.

233
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,690
You can hashtag that.

234
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,910
That'll be fun.

235
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,810
Anyhow, as the duck is actually
flowing across the

236
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,780
pond here, we run
into a problem.

237
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,540
Where before, in the software
mode, we would actually

238
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,890
rasterize the regions that
were dirtied by the duck

239
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,090
moving around, we now actually
have to rasterize more pixels

240
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,350
because we have to redraw
the entire tile that's

241
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,480
touched by the duck.

242
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,430
So as you can see here, we have
the duck moving from a

243
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,500
one by two over to
a two by two.

244
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,240
We have to redo all of
those tiles at once.

245
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,760
So we're touching a lot more
pixels during our animation.

246
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,770
So this means the GPU tiles
can actually get us

247
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,260
into a bit of a bind.

248
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,550
Clicky.

249
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,950
Clicky.

250
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,770
Hashtag clicky.

251
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,420
There you go.

252
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,670
Can you do it for me?

253
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,640

254
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,100
I think we just broke
the internet.

255
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,920
Anyone?

256
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,170
Can anyone fix the internet?

257
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,280

258
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,550
You are all tweeting
right now.

259
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,050
That's the problem.

260
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,390
You are all going
and tweeting.

261
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,410
You're hashtagging.

262
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,270
AUDIENCE: Don't you
mean Google+?

263
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,420
COLT MCANLIS: Google+'ing,
thank you.

264
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,670
Actually, thank you for that.

265
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,680

266
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,930
OK.

267
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,760

268
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,800
I can reboot it.

269
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,080
That might work.

270
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,990
Maybe I should install Vista.

271
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,610
That'll actually help too.

272
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,320

273
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,570
Or did we freeze?

274
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,920

275
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,970
I'm going to do a song
and dance while he

276
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,750
tries to fix this.

277
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,706
What do you want on here?

278
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:23,142
AUDIENCE: What's that?

279
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,672
COLT MCANLIS: What do you
want me to click here?

280
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:26,058
AUDIENCE: So go into
the movie.

281
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:28,830

282
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,100
COLT MCANLIS: He's going
to fix this.

283
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm going to tell some great
stories about rasterization

284
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,250
real quick.

285
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,210
So for those of you who don't
know, who haven't been over to

286
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,520
the Chrome booth yet, we
actually have an entire area

287
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,140
there dedicated to
performance.

288
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,590
So a lot of you web developers
out here who are running into

289
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,590
problems with compute processes,
rendering issues,

290
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,580
or even network load times,
please come by

291
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,850
and stop by the booth.

292
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,380
Talk to us.

293
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,400
We've got pretty much all of
the genius brains of Google

294
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,090
who work on performance day and
night there waiting to ask

295
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,490
you questions, and to answer
your problems, and to run your

296
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,310
site through our tools,
and to solve all

297
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,621
sorts of critical things.

298
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,550
Still need more time?

299
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,800
Cool.

300
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,600
I can keep doing this.

301
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,490
All right, so for too long,
we've actually been spending a

302
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,890
lot of time talking about
network or web performance in

303
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,740
just terms of page wait.

304
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,790
So we're very concerned
about load time.

305
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,840
But as we've started getting
more web apps on mobile and

306
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,350
web apps doing crazy things, we
realized that the wait that

307
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,740
the user experiences your app
while they're inside of it

308
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,250
actually has a large &mdash;

309
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,760
GRACE KLOBA: We're back.

310
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,140
COLT MCANLIS: We're back?

311
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,640
Oh, well I was in the
middle of something.

312
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,006
Hold on.

313
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:28,190
Hold on.

314
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,340
Wait, no, I'm not done yet.

315
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,760
GRACE KLOBA: OK.

316
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,320
COLT MCANLIS: We realized that
how the user experiences your

317
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,610
app inside of it actually has
a lot to do with how much

318
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,510
money they're willing to spend
and how much you get from that

319
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,270
user in terms of retention.

320
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,120
So this means that we have to
start worrying about the other

321
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,690
factors too, things like compute
performance and render

322
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,950
performance, which brings us
back to how we can utilize the

323
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,390
GPU to get awesome stuff done.

324
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,560
Did I break it again?

325
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,300
Maybe it's my clicker.

326
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,280
There we go.

327
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,250
OK, so to rehash, after a five
minute soliloquy, we have this

328
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,560
duck effectively moving
to the screen.

329
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,810
It would be ideal if we
could effectively

330
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,190
know the context here.

331
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,870
Is that we have the duck
moving and we have the

332
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,080
background static.

333
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,240
It would great if we could
somehow separate these two

334
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,440
items so that the GPU can handle
positioning of the duck

335
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,130
and we won't have to use all
of the extra CPU cycles

336
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,380
painting the duck in position.

337
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,890

338
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,920
And this is actually what we
can do inside of Chrome.

339
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,890
We actually allow some
annotations and some

340
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,230
intrinsics that you can add to
your page that allow you to

341
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,670
separate page elements into
separate GPU layers.

342
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,690
What this means is that
effectively each layer has its

343
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,750
own set of tiles.

344
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,270
They're uploaded once
to the GPU.

345
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,340
And then the GPU can position
these things around without

346
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,610
any interaction in the CPU.

347
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,070
Of course, this turbo charges
the duck in their animation

348
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,940
allowing it to do awesome stuff
through the screen.

349
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,320
And it allows the CPU to sit
back and drink margaritas and

350
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,870
basically chill out
while the GPU does

351
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,120
all the heavy lifting.

352
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,150

353
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,640
Sorry, we're having fun
technical problems.

354
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,060
What kind of conference would
this be if you don't get a

355
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,970
blue screen while installing
printer software?

356
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,430
Anyhow, so this is how the
GPU stuff is working.

357
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,400
Now let's actually talk about
how you, as a developer, can

358
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,130
control all of these things.

359
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,930
First, it's worth pointing out
that there's a set of page

360
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,170
elements that are auto promoted
to their own layer

361
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,090
once your HTML is parsed and
your page is loaded.

362
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,000
Depending on your platform,
and your build, and your

363
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,680
hardware spec, things like
canvas, video, iframe, and

364
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,300
plug-ins are all promoted
to their own

365
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,580
layer on your behalf.

366
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,440
You don't have to do anything.

367
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,900
And this is fantastic because
most the time these type of

368
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,890
page elements spend their
entirety updating large

369
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,040
portions of the screen.

370
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,810
They could be overlapping
with other tiles.

371
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,240
Recall the animation
that you saw with

372
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,070
the duck moving around.

373
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,440
So we're spending lots of times
updating and rasterizing

374
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,670
pixels we don't actually
need to.

375
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,540
GRACE KLOBA: There is also a
set of the CSS properties

376
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,700
which will manually
promote the page

377
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,220
element to its own layer.

378
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,060
For example, all the 3D
Transform, like TranslateZ,

379
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,170
Translate3D.

380
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,190
This making sense because these
transforms can be easily

381
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,470
accelerated on the GPU.

382
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,300
It's worth noting the 2D
transform does not promote the

383
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,660
element to its own layer, which
means they will be still

384
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,540
rendered in the software mode.

385
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,240

386
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,370
COLT MCANLIS: Now those two
examples are effectively load

387
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,840
time modifications.

388
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,780
So effectively, you parse the
page elements, or you parse

389
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,090
the page, and these things are
auto promoted on your behalf.

390
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,280
It's worth pointing out that
there's a set of CSS

391
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,370
properties that allow you to
push things to a separate

392
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,610
layer at run time.

393
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,560
And the two tags you need to
be concerned with are CSS

394
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,650
animations for opacity
and transform.

395
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,260
How these effectively work is
that when the page loads, an

396
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,910
element on the page will stay
static with the base layer.

397
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,950
Once the animation begins, the
element in question will

398
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,730
actually be promoted
to its own layer.

399
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,640
So the CPU has to spin up,
create a new layer, paint the

400
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,270
data into the new layer, as
well as go back and paint

401
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,730
where the object used to
be in the base layer.

402
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,620
Then as the animation occurs,
the GPU and the CPU are

403
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,130
working in harmony creating
happy ducks through the

404
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,720
universe in a plethora of all
the quacks that you hear

405
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,800
through the cosmos.

406
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,270
And then at the end of the
animation, the duck then has

407
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:14,115
to be promoted back to the
base layer where it &mdash;

408
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:14,560
there we go.

409
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,620
Maybe it's my clicker.

410
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,610
The duck has to be demoted back
to the base layer, which

411
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,160
means we have to kill the
original layer we had and then

412
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,070
rerasterize the area where
the duck finally lands.

413
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,770

414
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,950
I'm just going to let you click
everything from now on.

415
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,070
Of course, this means
that we run into

416
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,480
some interesting concepts.

417
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,740
So if we start an animation and
all of a sudden we see a

418
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,220
hitch in our performance, this
means that the CPU may be

419
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,370
doing too much work and actually
firing up, doing

420
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,280
rasterization, and moving on.

421
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,220
Which means of course we have
to start talking about well,

422
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,100
why isn't everything in a
layer and what are the

423
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,090
consequences and tradeoffs
of doing that?

424
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,920
Well the first off thing is you
shouldn't put everything

425
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,610
in its own layer.

426
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,940
Even though the GPU can move
these things around and

427
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
position them, there's actually
some consequences you

428
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,900
should be aware of.

429
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,420
First off, is the cost
of too many layers.

430
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,790
You need to know that each layer
you put on the screen

431
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,110
effectively creates
more tiles.

432
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,720
And as Grace mentioned before,
the GPU has a static

433
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,920
non-growable memory resource
in its texture cache.

434
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,500
So what happens is as these
tiles are invalidated and more

435
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,599
tiles exist, if the cache is
full, we effectively have to

436
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,400
push old tiles out of the cache
before we can actually

437
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,849
put the new tiles in.

438
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,460
This is going to put a lot of
pressure on your cache, which

439
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,690
is going to result in more
evictions, which is going to

440
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,120
result in a lot of additional
CPU overhead painting new

441
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,540
tiles that would have previously
been resident

442
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,300
inside of the cache.

443
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,170
In addition to the tile
overhead, you also have to

444
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,830
take into account just
the additional

445
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,250
processing that's involved.

446
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,070
Now, this is minimal compared
to the cache thrashing.

447
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,580
But effectively, each layer that
you add has to be sorted

448
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,420
every frame.

449
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,840
There has to be occlusion
determinations that occur.

450
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,110
And then Chrome can actually
go through and do union

451
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,990
processing to determine whether
or not it should

452
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,820
actually draw something.

453
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,560
So let's say you have an object
and then you have an

454
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,650
opaque layer in front of it, we
may be actually able to not

455
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,421
draw that lower object because
it's actually hidden.

456
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:08,610

457
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,130
GRACE KLOBA: So there's
overhead, as Colt mentioned,

458
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,400
when the animation starts.

459
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,230
We pay extra cost to
promote the page

460
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,730
element to its own layer.

461
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,080
So if there is a lot of pixels
during the paint that may take

462
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,510
a longer time, which means
there's a long delay for the

463
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,570
animation to start.

464
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,540
So what you can do is, as we
earlier mentioned, the CSS

465
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,460
properties can permanently
move the page

466
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,140
element to its own layer.

467
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,950
So you can either translateZ(0)
to promote it in

468
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,660
the page loading time.

469
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,490
Of course, the tradeoff
is it's going to

470
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,460
use a lot of memory.

471
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,770
So now the job is &mdash;

472
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,490
it's your job to make the
decision whether you want

473
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,320
animation to start instantly
or you want to

474
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,570
preserve the memory.

475
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,440

476
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,470
Let's look at another example.

477
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,050
So on a mobile site, it's a
common case to try to slide in

478
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,660
some content from off
screen to on screen.

479
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,810
So for example, we have
this helpful duck.

480
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,170
When the page loaded, the
duck is off screen.

481
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,660
And then it has a display now.

482
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,010
So when the user asks the duck
for help and then what you

483
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,890
probably would do is change the
display property from none

484
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,390
to block and start
the animation.

485
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,560
Unfortunately, we cannot start
the animation right away

486
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,330
because we have to go
to paint the duck .

487
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,750
If this duck is fat, big, taking
a lot of pixels, it may

488
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,040
take a little bit longer time.

489
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,490
So what do we do?

490
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:59,830
Remember earlier, we mentioned
Chrome does pre-paint.

491
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,415
So if you keep that display
block property, even when the

492
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:08,310
duck is off the screen and also
use a previous trick we

493
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:13,030
mentioned, using the
translateZ(0) to permanently

494
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,040
promote it to its own layer,
after page loaded, before the

495
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,210
animation start, Chrome
will paint the

496
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,120
duck in its own layer.

497
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,170
So when user calls the duck for
help, the duck will just

498
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,090
jump out right away.

499
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,430
Of course, everything
there is a tradeoff.

500
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,280
If the user never calls the duck
for help, we still spend

501
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,950
cycles on the CPU to paint the
duck and then allocated memory

502
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,220
on the GPU to cache it.

503
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,130
COLT MCANLIS: So what basically
we're getting at

504
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,730
here is that with these small
annotations and these CSS

505
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,940
properties, you can actually
control how the GPU is being

506
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,200
used to render your page.

507
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,660
So you guys can make faster
loading websites, faster

508
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,960
rendering websites, which make
your users happier, which

509
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,460
means your websites
make more money.

510
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,840
And then your boss recognizes
your contribution and gives

511
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,160
you the bonus and promotion.

512
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,420
So really, we're here to help
you get promotions so you can

513
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,740
drink margaritas and stuff.

514
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,540
Now with that, that we're giving
to you, we're asking

515
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,610
you to then understand that as
we inject the GPU into the

516
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,130
process, some parts of the
architecture of how Chrome

517
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,930
works changes, which You
need to be aware of.

518
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,110
Most important of that
is how input is being

519
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,300
handled with this.

520
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,470
Because we're actually taking
what was a single-threaded

521
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,910
process and adding some new
components into it.

522
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,980
GRACE KLOBA: So before we talk
about this new [INAUDIBLE]

523
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,380
threaded compositing, let's take
a look at how without it

524
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,520
how it works.

525
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,520
So threaded compositing is a new
concept that we added into

526
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,570
the Chrome.

527
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,200
And the Chrome [INAUDIBLE]

528
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,460
working on Chrome for
Android, Chrome for

529
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
Chrome OS, and on Windows.

530
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,830
We're soon going to turn
it on the Mac.

531
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:52,070
So when something changed
[INAUDIBLE]

532
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,400
that's what do you did.

533
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,630
And then we will do the paint
and the composite

534
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,600
on the BLINK thread.

535
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,340
And then present this content
through the GPU commands to

536
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,470
the driver.

537
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,890
But the driver only consume
the GPU commands up to the

538
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,450
refresh rate.

539
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,000
For example, at a 60 FPS display
it only consume the

540
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,700
frame at 16.6 millisecond time
frame, which means there's no

541
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,740
need, in our case, even the
paint and to composite a small

542
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,430
amount of the work, there is
still no need to paint it

543
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,780
twice using a 16 milliseconds
frame.

544
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,440
COLT MCANLIS: And to be fair,
that diagram is actually a

545
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,310
little misleading.

546
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,340
The what's going on under the
hood in these browsers is not

547
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,290
actually that simple.

548
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,210
It's actually chaos in a jar,
what's really going on.

549
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,970
Effectively, if you look at
our single-threaded model

550
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,910
here, you have lots and lots
of resources and events

551
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,200
fighting for time slices on this
single-threaded model.

552
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,920
So things like parsing,
layout, paint,

553
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,760
all of these things.

554
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,600
So what happens is if we
actually get one of these

555
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,690
VBLANKS coming along asking for
updated data, there's a

556
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,480
good chance that with all
of the processing that's

557
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,480
occurring that the thread has
not actually had a chance to

558
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,320
paint and give the VBLANK an
updated vision of the scene.

559
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,620
Now, what's really interesting
about this, when you dig a

560
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,490
little bit deeper, is that
there's some things that you,

561
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,800
as a developer, can control.

562
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,040
So if we look at the breakdown
of the blocks here, things

563
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,070
like Touch Events, JavaScript
Events, onload callbacks, you

564
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,250
as developers really are in
control of how long those

565
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,960
events take on the JavaScript
processing thread.

566
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,130
Now, there's some other
things though that you

567
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,970
really can't control.

568
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,420
You can wave your hands at it
and maybe do some juju dances,

569
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,600
but it's really not going to
change because on the browser

570
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,920
side of things, that's
controlled &mdash;

571
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,590
things like layout, paints,
and compositing.

572
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,220
Now, the good thing is that some
of these can actually be

573
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,240
moved off onto different threads
because of modern

574
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,110
architectures.

575
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,730
Like most of the phones in your
pockets actually have

576
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,740
multiple cores, which means we
can utilize modern techniques

577
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,280
for threaded programming.

578
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,570
Now, there's a great technique
that Chrome does use called

579
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,060
multi-threaded painting, which
actually allows us to take the

580
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,950
paint block, which traditionally
was single

581
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,750
threaded sharing time with all
of your JavaScript events, and

582
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,770
actually thread that out off
to multiple threads, which

583
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,290
reduces the amount
of time it takes.

584
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,150
Now, we're not going to talk
about that today because

585
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,360
that's not on the GPU.

586
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,390
Instead, what we're going to
talk about today is this other

587
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,280
block here, which is actually
the composite operation.

588
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,400
The best way to think about this
is after your painting is

589
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,830
done, remember that Chrome has
to go back and actually create

590
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,200
all of these graphics driver
commands, GPU commands, to

591
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,450
take those textures and upload
them to the GPU and then

592
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,950
actually do that submit.

593
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,685
Of course, that isn't
actually free.

594
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:31,790
It actually cuts into
your frame time.

595
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,930
So what we want to talk about
today is how we move that off

596
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,020
onto a different thread and
what that means for you.

597
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,450
So we now have the BLINK thread,
which is effectively

598
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,700
responsible &mdash;

599
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,050

600
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,680
if there's one thing you should
all take away from this

601
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,180
today is that there are tons of
technical problems on this

602
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,480
side of the stage.

603
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,250
Basically we have our BLINK
thread, which handles all of

604
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,260
our JavaScript processing,
including layout and other

605
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,080
sorts of things.

606
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,520
And we can actually move the
composite operation down onto

607
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,480
a separate thread.

608
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,470
So this means that whenever the
system can define that a

609
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,940
composite is actually needed, we
can actually go through and

610
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,150
kick off a composite onto
a separate thread.

611
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,420

612
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,750
And one more.

613
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,490
GRACE KLOBA: One more.

614
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:12,720
OK.

615
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,370
COLT MCANLIS: There we go.

616
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:14,900
Too far.

617
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,480
No, go back.

618
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,850
The universe, you divided
by 0, no.

619
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,710
GRACE KLOBA: OK.

620
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,970
Calm down.

621
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,460
So it's good.

622
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,910
We move the composite into
a separate thread.

623
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,240
So we offload some work
from the BLINK thread.

624
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,170
But there is a key change we
made is let the composite

625
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,850
thread to accept input events
when it is possible.

626
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,530
For example, scroll events can
be received and processed on

627
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,100
the composite thread without
the intervention

628
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,000
of the BLINK thread.

629
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,050
This allows us to scroll as fast
as possible even there is

630
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:04,570
a long JavaScript is executing
in the BLINK thread.

631
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,690
It is the for this exactly
reason we ask you to let the

632
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,940
browser to scroll.

633
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,910

634
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,660
Simply put, if you're using
touch events or mousewheel

635
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,330
events to drive the scroll, the
benefit of the threaded

636
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,150
compositing is thrown
out of the window.

637
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,370
The custom scroll libraries
normally will put a touch

638
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,830
handler, mousewheel handler,
and then they will call

639
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,370
prevent default.

640
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,960
So the result is there's no
scroll events happen or get

641
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,770
sent to compositers thread.

642
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,600
What compositers thread can do
is just wait for the BLINK

643
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,130
thread to process the JavaScript
doing the layout

644
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,060
and then paint.

645
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,020
This is essentially go back to
the single thread [INAUDIBLE].

646
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,750

647
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,330
COLT MCANLIS: Now,
this is actually

648
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,610
pretty common on mobile.

649
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,560
So how many of you guys actually
have a mobile website

650
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,655
that has a static header
at the top of it?

651
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:04,800
A good amount of hands.

652
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,760
So OK, keep your hands up.

653
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,500
Keep your hands up.

654
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,200
How many of you, in order to
keep that banner at the top of

655
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,810
the page, actually intercept
the scroll handler?

656
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,490
Still a couple of you, OK.

657
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,650
Well, I'm here to let
you know that that's

658
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,210
actually a bad practice.

659
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,820
So just like Grace said, that
when you intercept the scroll

660
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,490
handler on Chrome for Android,
what you're effectively doing

661
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,200
is throwing out all of the
cool stuff you get from

662
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,160
multi-threaded compositing.

663
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,110
And the result of that is what
you're going to see is that as

664
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,560
the page scrolls, the scroll's
going to happen and the

665
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,850
headers going to move, whether
you like it or not.

666
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,610
And then your JavaScript
code is actually going

667
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,720
to execute and fire.

668
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,280
And then you'll see your header
snap to the position

669
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,430
that you want it to go to.

670
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,020
So if we have this beautiful
Duck Surfing 101 page here and

671
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,680
you have the page scroll, you
actually want this thing to

672
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,250
stay static.

673
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,950
Now, instead of actually
intercepting the scroll

674
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,470
handler, you can take advantage
of these CSS

675
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,210
properties that we've been using
and actually put the

676
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,090
header in its own layer.

677
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,475
So if you actually add a
position fixed as well as a

678
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:59,580
z-index 0 to this thing &mdash; or
z-index anything really, just

679
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,600
as long as a z-index is there
so you can create proper

680
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,825
context stacking.

681
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:06,200
What this will do is actually
promote the header into its

682
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,880
own layer and allow the page
itself to transition

683
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,400
underneath it.

684
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,250
So you will get the overhead of
having your own layer, but

685
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,440
you won't get the ghost chasing
effect that you're

686
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,680
going to see on top of mobile.

687
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,560
If you want a really great
example of who does this

688
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,470
right, definitely check out
the Google I/O 2013 mobile

689
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,280
site where we do this on
the session agenda.

690
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,250
You can actually see as things
scroll, we have these static

691
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,280
headers at the top and it
does it the right way.

692
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,950
Look at the source code.

693
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,020
It's a great example.

694
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,330
And so with that though, it's
worth pointing out, that we

695
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,810
just gave you an example that
we didn't talk about before.

696
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,090
We talked about TranslateZ.

697
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,825
We talked about overflow.

698
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:42,210
We talked about those other
things and that will promote

699
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,770
items into their own
layer as well.

700
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,050
But in reality, you may have
inadvertently put something

701
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,280
into a layer without really
knowing about it, which means

702
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,950
that we are not leaving
you abandoned here.

703
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,530
We actually have updated our
tools to tell you how the GPU

704
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,330
is doing things.

705
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,780
First off, there's a fantastic
set of flags that you can turn

706
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,700
on in Chrome's dev tools
that will tell you

707
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,010
where the layers are.

708
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,830
First off, if you open up dev
tools you actually see this

709
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,190
beautiful awesome little flag
there that says, Show

710
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,600
Composited Borders.

711
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,630
What effectively this does is
any of your layers it will add

712
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,090
an orange border around the
boundaries of the layer.

713
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,950
So I randomly took a picture
of a random website on the

714
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,800
internet here.

715
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,750
And you can actually see that
what we have here is lots and

716
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,280
lots and lots of layers.

717
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,880
That's what each one of those
orange borders means.

718
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,620
So part of their feed here,
effectively, is each layer.

719
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,270
If you look at the source code
of this, you'll actually see

720
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,800
that each one of those leaf
elements in the DOM has

721
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,420
TranslateZ on it.

722
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,160
So once again, you're seeing
that this would come to bad

723
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,810
performance like we've
already talked about.

724
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,300
Because each one of those
layers is going to have

725
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,250
additional tiles.

726
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,290
All of those tiles are going to
be fighting for residency

727
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,670
inside of GPU memory.

728
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,330
And of course, this is going to
slow things down on mobile.

729
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,970
Now the cool thing is that it's
not always axial aligned

730
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,990
like one of the images there.

731
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,090
You can see that they actually
have this loading icon that is

732
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,190
going to be rotated with a CSS
transform as well as a little

733
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,460
animated gif too.

734
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,650
And you can see that the cool
borders match that as well.

735
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,520
Now, it's worth pointing out
that these borders, as they're

736
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,800
rendered, actually obey
occlusion ordering.

737
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,230
So effectively, if you've got
that nice little spinning

738
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,220
thing and then an image in
front of it, you won't

739
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,340
actually see that border.

740
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,850
So take that into account
as you're moving along.

741
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,540
Another great tool that you can
actually dive into is one

742
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,410
called chrome://tracing.

743
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,310
Now chrome://tracing
personally &mdash;

744
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,860
hey, I'm a beat box guy now.

745
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,600
Chrome://tracing is actually
my favorite tool inside of

746
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,930
Chrome because it will actually
tell you what Chrome

747
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,420
is doing under the hood.

748
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,920
Effectively, it gives you a
hierarchical view of the call

749
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,300
stack that's happening inside of
Chrome based upon what your

750
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,390
website is doing.

751
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,360
So I actually put together a
little test page to give you

752
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,330
this graphic here.

753
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,440
And effectively, all the test
page did was load a bunch of

754
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,710
large images, like 1024's and
2048's, and actually resize

755
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,200
them with a width and height
parameter down to 64 by 64's.

756
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,160
And this is what
chrome://tracing showed me.

757
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,040
So first off, the 1024 by
1024 actually took 51

758
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,420
milliseconds to decode.

759
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,970
And then after that,
it took another 29

760
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,910
milliseconds to resize.

761
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,690
So think of it this way, for
all of you guys in here who

762
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,890
are doing responsive web design,
and you're sending

763
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,230
your full resolution desktop
images down to your mobile

764
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,980
client because you feel that
that's the only way you can

765
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,540
handle viewport differences,
you could be

766
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,020
wasting a lot of time.

767
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,190
Instead, you can see that the
next image that I had in the

768
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,770
list was much smaller.

769
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,410
It was about 128 by 128.

770
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,420
So the decode took less
time, as well as the

771
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,840
resize took less time.

772
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,060
So the cool thing to take away
from this slide is that we can

773
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,410
actually figure out how your
page is using the GPU by

774
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,900
looking at some patterns that
you can see inside of

775
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,650
chrome://tracing.

776
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,250
GRACE KLOBA: So earlier we
talked about browser scroll

777
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,240
versus JavaScript scroll.

778
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,930
Let's take a look in the
chrome://tracing.

779
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:47,000
So in this case, the top row
is a compositers thread.

780
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,080
The bottom row called
[? CrRendererMain ?]

781
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,290
is essentially the
BLINK thread.

782
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:58,090
The number on the left is a
process ID because compositer

783
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,950
and the BLINK thread are both in
the render process, so they

784
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,390
have the same number,
same process ID.

785
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:11,260
Chrome trace also comes with
this nice FPS guideline.

786
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:18,870
So it's running at a 60 FPS,
repeated at 16.6 milliseconds.

787
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,570
In this case, [INAUDIBLE]

788
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:24,680
line data was the first
composite in this window.

789
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:31,850
As you can see, the scroll is
updated nicely at 60 FPS, even

790
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,070
when we have a long paint
happening in the BLINK thread.

791
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,940

792
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,780
Let's take look at
another trace.

793
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,180
This is done on the same device
with the same version

794
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,780
of the Chrome.

795
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,360
Instead, we load a different
page, of course.

796
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,450
Otherwise, it should be same.

797
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,900
So in this page, the JavaScript
is hijacking the

798
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:00,830
touch events, and then drive
the scrolling of the page.

799
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,920
First thing we did is pull back
our IPS guideline and

800
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,860
left the line with the
first composite.

801
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,960
Immediately, you will notice
between the second and the

802
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,600
third composite, it took 33
milliseconds instead of the 16

803
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,640
milliseconds.

804
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,190
Why?

805
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,310
Because in this case, we also
have a long paint happening in

806
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,700
the BLINK thread.

807
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,600
And because the scrolling is
driven by the JavaScript, so

808
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,640
the composite step in the
compositers thread cannot

809
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,480
start until the paint
is finished.

810
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:49,720
So again, the thing you want to
learn from this example is

811
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,380
let the browser scroll.

812
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,140
COLT MCANLIS: And with that, we
can recap what we've talked

813
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,020
about today.

814
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,050
Four main bullet points to
walk away from this talk.

815
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,230
Number one, making a
presentation is a lot more

816
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,220
technically difficult apparently
than writing a

817
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,960
whole web browser.

818
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,750
First off is actually
GPU plus layers

819
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,010
equals faster rendering.

820
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,110
By actually getting the GPU
into the mix and actually

821
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,600
using layers, we can allow it
to alleviate a lot of the

822
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,540
processing burden that would
previously exist in

823
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,580
rasterization on the CPU.

824
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,170
But that comes with a caveat
though, is that too many

825
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,940
layers is going to be a
seriously bad time.

826
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,540
If you put too many layers out
there, everything's going to

827
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,560
be fighting for residency inside
of the GPU tile cache

828
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,139
and that's going to create
some problems.

829
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,489
In addition to that, that's
going to create some changes

830
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:33,340
in how input is handled,
especially for mobile devices,

831
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,300
which means that you guys
should really let Chrome

832
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,090
handle the scrolling
of things.

833
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,280
You're going to have a
smoother frame rate.

834
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,409
It's going to give your
users a better

835
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,429
impression of your site.

836
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,940
You're going to make lots of
money and get really cool

837
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,194
promotions.

838
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:44,699
And then you can send Grace and
I emails thanking us for

839
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,650
all of our time and effort
that we put into this

840
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,270
technically flawed talk.

841
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,050
And then finally, if you're not
really sure what's going

842
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,210
on, please use tooling to
verify what's going

843
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,050
on under the hood.

844
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,280
Use things like show composited
borders, as well as

845
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,190
about tracing and get
a really good deep

846
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,160
dive of what's happening.

847
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,650
So with that, we thank you all
so much for giving us your

848
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,620
time today.

849
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,660
Before we take off, I want
to actually, once again,

850
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,920
encourage all of you to use the
perfmatters hashtag for

851
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,340
any of your web performance
related things.

852
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,150
As well as invite you
to join the Google+

853
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,570
web performance community.

854
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,660
You can see the short link
there goo.gl/webperf.

855
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,840
It's a fantastic community.

856
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,020
We've got lots of the big brains
in web performance all

857
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,850
contributing there.

858
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,360
It's a community of awesome
web performance stuff.

859
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,760
With that, it looks like we've
got about four minutes and 30

860
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,530
seconds for questions.

861
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,390
The mics are here.

862
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,230
Please give us your thoughts.

863
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,510
Thank you.

864
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:44,410
[APPLAUSE]

865
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,230
AUDIENCE: I have three brief
questions if I can read my own

866
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:47,770
handwriting.

867
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,780
COLT MCANLIS: Wait, how
brief can they be?

868
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,400
You wrote them down.

869
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,860
AUDIENCE: That was so I
could pay attention.

870
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,710
COLT MCANLIS: That's not
a brief question.

871
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,040
AUDIENCE: What is the limit
to the number of tiles?

872
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,580
Is it 100 tiles, 1,000 tiles,
10 tiles, in the mem

873
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,405
cache of the GPU?

874
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:05,120
GRACE KLOBA: It really
depends.

875
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,240
As we mentioned, the impact
of the tiles is memory.

876
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,080
So we try to do &mdash;

877
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,240
[? the parsing ?]

878
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,800
is the tile is fully behind
it, we're not

879
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,090
going to render it.

880
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,910
But if there is overlap because
of the tile size, you

881
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,290
of course pay the overhead.

882
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,760
So that depends on how
much you overlap.

883
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,650
AUDIENCE: So I guess the main
question is, how big is the

884
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,170
memory that's allocated
to the GPU?

885
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,940
GRACE KLOBA: As I think I
mentioned earlier, it's really

886
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,645
device dependent.

887
00:36:35,645 --> 00:36:37,990
So for example, [INAUDIBLE]

888
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:43,950
the Android mobile device,
we're basically using the

889
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,810
memory limit, which is &mdash;

890
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,410
most of today's mobile devices
are unified memory.

891
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:56,080
So the total memory on the
Galaxy Nexus is 1 gig, on the

892
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,990
Nexus 10 it's 2 gig.

893
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,520
That's overall memory.

894
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,815
But available for the GPU we use
that one as a measurement

895
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:06,900
and also using the screen
resolution as a measurement.

896
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,680
In these two cases, we probably
allocated a limited,

897
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,600
so around 256 meg.

898
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,880
AUDIENCE: OK, so it's actually
part of the RAM is &mdash;

899
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,920
GRACE KLOBA: Yeah,
part of the RAM.

900
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,370
And then we have to be
conservative because there's

901
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,020
other apps.

902
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,030
So we basically allocate a
budget based on the device

903
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,077
memory limit and the
screen resolution.

904
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,860
AUDIENCE: OK, should I go to the
back of the line or ask &mdash;

905
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,150
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah,
if you don't mind.

906
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,190
We'll get some more
questions in here.

907
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,980
This side over here.

908
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,670
AUDIENCE: Hi, question is, are
there any good methods for

909
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,080
syncing scrolling between
different panes, if you want

910
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,950
to create a paned approach, that
don't rely on JavaScript?

911
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,290
GRACE KLOBA: Different page?

912
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,040
AUDIENCE: Panes.

913
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,170
So for example, your
iOS session

914
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,010
example was a good one.

915
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,020
I noticed on iOS on Safari
that while the vertical

916
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,530
scrolling sticks nicely, the
horizontal scrolling doesn't

917
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,340
work at all.

918
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,160
It doesn't keep it in
sync as you scroll.

919
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,680
So are there mechanisms to have
different divs within a

920
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,470
web page where the scrolling in
one direction or the other

921
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,850
is synced between them, and yet,
still have some of the

922
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,260
advantages of layering?

923
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,800
GRACE KLOBA: I think, if I
understand the question, is

924
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,180
you want the vertical scroll
handled by the browser, but

925
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,670
the left and the right
handled by content?

926
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,520
AUDIENCE: Yeah, think of Google
spreadsheet where you

927
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,010
have the ability to split panes
and go both directions.

928
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,730
Well, when I scroll horizontally
I need both the

929
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:33,040
header, or top and bottom
panes, to stay in sync.

930
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,630
COLT MCANLIS: I think the &mdash;

931
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,785
AUDIENCE: When I scroll
vertically I need &mdash;

932
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:36,035
COLT MCANLIS: You have
to invoke dark magic.

933
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:39,830

934
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,040
That's a tricky one.

935
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,100
Let's dig deep on that if
you guys wouldn't mind.

936
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,420
We're actually running
out of time here.

937
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,560
And I know there's lots of
question, so Grace and I will

938
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,550
actually be at the Chrome
Office Hours for

939
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,500
the next half hour.

940
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,180
Please, everyone in line and
anyone else who has questions,

941
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,190
please come meet us there.

942
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,110
Let's talk more about this stuff
and help you guys out.

943
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,270
Once again, thank you
for your time today.

944
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,170
Appreciate it.

945
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,778
